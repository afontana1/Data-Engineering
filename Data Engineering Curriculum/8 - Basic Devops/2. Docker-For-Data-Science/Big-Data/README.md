In this folder you will find a docker-compose.yml that have the following services:
- Hadoop HDFS (Namenode, Datanode and Resource Manager)
- Hive (Server, Metastore and Metastore psql)
- Apache Hue
- Jupyter PySpark Notebook

This docker-compose lets you have a Big Data personal local environment to develop Big Data apps with the help of:
- HDFS as storage layer
- Hive as a Warehouse based on HDFS and Queriable layer
- PySpark notebook for the processing layer
- Apache Hue for Hadoop User Experience (Hadoop UI) so you can query the Hive Warehouse in case is needed
