# Docker For Data Science
This is a repository of different Docker Containers that I have created over time to work on different Data Science projects. 

Each folder has a topic, and inside that folder are the definition and the use case. 


You can also create your own docker-compose.yml by following this [article](https://sebascar322.medium.com/own-postgresql-db-using-docker-yes-why-not-94311adebd47)
