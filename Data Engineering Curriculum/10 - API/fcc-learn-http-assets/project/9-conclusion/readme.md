# Submit the link to your repository above!

If you haven't been keeping track of your project in Git, you should be! Once you have your finished project on GitHub or another source control platform, submit the link to your project above! Your link should look something like `https://github.com/gihub-username/repo-name`.

I hope you've enjoyed the project, it's always good to solidify the things you learn in courses by getting your hands dirty with a real project.

## Ideas for extending the project

* Make the script run on a timer and deploy it to a server. Have it email you every so often with a report.
* Add more robust error checking so that you can crawl larger sites without issues.
* Count external links, as well as internal links, and add them to the report
* Save the report as a CSV spreadsheet rather than printing it to the console
* Use a graphics library to create an image that shows the links between the pages as a graph visualization
* Make requests concurrently to speed up the crawling process
* Add a `README.md` file explaining to users how to clone your git repo and get started
