# Why use XML?

XML and JSON both accomplish similar tasks, so which should you use?

XML used to be used for the same things that today JSON is used for. Configuration files, HTTP bodies, and other data-transfer use cases can work just fine using JSON or XML. My advice is that generally speaking if JSON works, you should favor it over XML these days. JSON is lighter-weight, easier to read, and has better support in most modern programming languages.

There are some cases where XML might still be the better, or maybe even the *necessary* choice, but those cases will be rare.
