# Web Addresses Quiz

To recap, a "domain name" is part of a URL. It's the part that tells the computer *where the server is located on the internet* by being converted into a numerical IP address.

We'll cover exactly how an IP address is used by your computer to find a path to the server in a later networking course. For now, it's just important to understand that an IP address is what your computer is using at a lower level to communicate on a network.

Deploying a real website to the internet is actually quite simple. It involves only a couple of steps:

1. Create a server that hosts your website files and connect it to the internet
2. Acquire a domain name
3. Connect the domain name to the IP address of your server
4. Your server is accessible via the internet!
