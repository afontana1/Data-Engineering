# HTTP Requests and Responses

At the heart of HTTP is a simple request-response system. The "requesting" computer, also known as the ["client"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)), asks another computer for some information. That computer, ["the server"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) sends back a response with the information that was requested.

We'll talk about the specifics of how the "requests" and "responses" are formatted later. For now, just think of it as a simple question-and-answer system.

* Request: "What are the items in the Fantasy Quest game?"
* Response: `A list of the items in the Fantasy Quest game`.
