# Network Tab Practice

Open your browser's Dev Tools and navigate to the *Network* tab, then refresh this page.

Poke around through the different requests that you see. Notice that you can select a request and see its request and response headers. Request headers are sent from your browser to the server. Response headers are the headers sent back from the server to your browser.

You will use the information you find within the headers tab to answer the following questions.
