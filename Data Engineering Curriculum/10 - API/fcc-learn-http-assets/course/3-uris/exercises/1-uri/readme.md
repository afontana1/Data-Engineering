# Uniform Resource Identifiers

We briefly touched on URLs earlier, let's dive a little deeper into the subject.

A [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier), or Uniform Resource *Identifier*, is a unique character sequence that identifies a resource that is (almost always) accessed via the internet. 

Just like JavaScript has syntax rules, so do URIs. These rules help ensure uniformity so that any program can interpret the meaning of the URI in the same way.

URIs come in two main types:

* [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)
* [URNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name)

We will focus specifically on URLs in this course, but it's important to know that URLs are only one kind of URI.
