# Further dissecting a URL

There are 8 main parts to a URL, though not all the sections are always present. Each piece plays a specific role in helping clients locate the specified resource.

The 8 sections are:

* The protocol is required
* Usernames and passwords are optional
* A domain is required
* The default port for a given protocol is used if one is not provided
* The default (`/`) path is used if one isn't provided
* A query is optional
* A fragment is optional

## Don't get too hung up on memorizing this stuff

Because names for the different sections are often used interchangeably, and because not all the parts of the URL are always present, it can be hard to keep things straight.

Don't worry about memorizing this stuff! Try to just get familiar with these URL concepts from a high level. Like any good developer, you can just look it up again the next time you need to know more!
