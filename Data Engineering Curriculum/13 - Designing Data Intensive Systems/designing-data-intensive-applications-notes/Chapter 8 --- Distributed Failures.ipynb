    "# Distributed Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computers are designed to fail all at once and catastrophically.\n",
    "* Distributed services are fundamentally different. They need to fail only partially, if possible, in order to allow as many services as possible to continue to operate.\n",
    "* This unlocks a lot of additional failure modes, **partial failures**, which are both hard to understand and hard to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long discussion of network flakiness...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modern computers have both a time-of-day clock and a monotonic clock. The former is a user-facing clock that can move backwards or stop in time. The latter is a constantly forward-propagating clock, but only the difference between values is meaningful; its absolute magnitude is meaningless.\n",
    "* Both clocks are ruled over by NTP synchronization, when the computer is online.\n",
    "* These clocks are quartz-based, and subject to approximately 35 ms average errors.\n",
    "* Furthermore, processes may pause for arbitrarily long periods of time due to things like garbage collection and context switches.\n",
    "* Things that depend on timeouts, like creating a global log in a distriobuted system (databases) or expiring leader-given leases (GFS), must account for this possibility.\n",
    "* You can omit these delays if you try hard enough. Systems like flight controls and airbags operate are **hard real-time systems** that do so. But these are really, really hard to build, and highly limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithms can be proven to work correctly in a given an unreliable **system model**. But you have to choose your model carefully.\n",
    "* A point that Jespen makes: these algorithms are hard to implement in a durable way. The theory is far ahead of the practice, but a lot of architects try to homegrow their conflict resolution, which is problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* One simplifying assumption we make when designing fault tolerant systems is that nodes and services never purposefully lie.\n",
    "* If a node sends an knowingly untrue message to another node, this is known as a **Byzantine fault**. \n",
    "* Byzantine faults must be addressed in the design of public distributed systems, like the Internet or blockchain. But they can be ignored in the design of a service system, as obviously you will not purposefully lie to yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In designing a distributed system, one that is protected from Byzantine faults, you often need to design around causal dependency. You need to understand what a node knew when it made a decision, as that knowledge informs how you will heal any resulting divergence.\n",
    "* **Vector clocks** are an algorithm for this (e.g. Dynamo).\n",
    "* An alterantive is preserving a **total ordering** of operations (e.g. MongoDB)."
