# Preface
Drive forces for developments in dbs, distributed systems, & the ways apps are built on top of them:
- The need to handle huge volumes of data and traffic, at scale
- The need to be agile, to reduce the time to market, to keep dev cycles short and data models flexible
- Preference to open source software over commercial/in-house software
- CPU's clock speed increases minimally, while multi-core processors are standard. Network speeds increases - All favors parallelism. 
- IaaS such as AWS allows for small teams to build distributed systems cross machines and regions. 
- The need to be highly available. 

We call an app data-intensive if data is the primary challenge â€” the quantity/complexity/speed-of-change of data, as opposed to compute-intensive (where CPU cycles are the bottleneck).

As software engineers and architects, to build good applications, we need to have a precise understanding of the various technologies and their trade-offs. 

Behind the rapid changes in tech, there are enduring principles. If you understand those principles, you can see where each tool fits in, how to make good use of it, and how to avoid its pitfalls. 

The book examines successful data systems: technologies that form the foundation of many popular applications which meet scalability, performance, and reliability requirements in production.
