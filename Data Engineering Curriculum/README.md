# Data Engineering Tutorials

When I first started data engineering, there was not a good learning pathway. Data Engineering is distinct from software engineering. There were plenty of resources related to that, but no one-stop-shop place that contains fundamentals for DE's. This is an attempt to fill that gap without having to pay for a course. These projects assume you are not a complete beginner. For example, nothing here will tell you what a REST API is.
