# Project 2: Tracking User Activity
- In this project, you work at an ed tech firm. You've created a service that delivers assessments, and now lots of different customers (e.g., Pearson) want to publish their assessments on it. You need to get ready for data scientists who work for these customers to run queries on the data.

- Through 3 different activites, you will spin up existing containers and prepare the infrastructure to land the data in the form and structure it needs to be to be queried.

  1) Publish and consume messages with kafka.
  2) Use spark to transform the messages.
  3) Use spark to transform the messages so that you can land them in hdfs.
