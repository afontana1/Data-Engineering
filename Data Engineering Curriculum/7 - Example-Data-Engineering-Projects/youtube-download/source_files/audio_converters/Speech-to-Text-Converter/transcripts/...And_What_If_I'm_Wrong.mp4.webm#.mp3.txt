 okay so I die right and and much to my surprise I find myself standing before the god of Christianity what do I do how do I feel about this what what would I think what should I say what if I'm wrong and when I think about this question I think about the fact that there are two very interesting characteristics that have always been attributed to this God and one is Omni benevolence optimal love optimal compassion Optimum Mercy optimal concern for the well-being of others and the other is omniscience knowing everything that could possibly be known about anything from any point of view at any time in any context and one inescapable conclusion that follows from this is that if this being exists it knows me I mean really knows me understands me as well as I can possibly be understood this is I'm not a mystery he is not sitting up in heaven racking his brain trying to figure out why Scott can't seem to believe in him this God would be acutely aware of my history of the causal chain of events and experiences that cumulatively contributed to the development of my entire personality and psyche and outlook on life this being would understand impeccably that I am nothing more and nothing less than a product of that which I have experienced every interaction that I've ever had it changed me or forced me to think differently down to the exact moment in my life which caused me to care about philosophy and religion and theology in the afterlife this being would have a perfect appreciation for that God would understand intimately my reasoning and my thought process and how I arrived at the conclusions I did even if Christians don't he would know my views on morality and ethics and understand specifically why I think it more virtuous to approach religious claims critically and prudently then to accept them at face value on faith he would understand why I think that I've lived a good life why I think that I've made good choices even if Christians don't he would be aware of all the actions and all the characteristics that I've seen attributed to him by Christians as well as scripture and why those actions and characteristics seem reliably incompatible to me not just with one another but with the observable world he would know about the time in my life when I actually picked up a Bible and made it a point to read the whole thing and he would know the hundreds of verses I Came Upon which which I found horrifying or absurd or completely incompatible with the notion that this was inspired by a just and loving being concerned with ensuring our Salvation even if Christians don't so if I found myself standing before this being it goes without saying that my immediate reaction would be one of complete shock complete and utter shock I would be absolutely floored if I found out with certainty that the Christian God specifically exists and the first question the first thought that would even enter into my mind I know would be what was wrong with my reasoning I would beg I would plead regardless of whether I was on my way play to heaven or hell just to know what the flaw was in my thinking where along the way were the mistakes I made that led me to the wrong conclusion I would give anything to know that I would give anything to know the answers of course this God would know all too well I took truth very seriously in my life I never believed anything simply because I wanted it to be true or because I thought it would be beneficial in some way to assume it was true and likewise I never doubted any claim simply because I preferred it not to be true but I would take comfort in knowing that the being responsible for judging me for evaluating me and ultimately deciding my fate knows me so perfectly that I don't have to make any excuses for myself the omniscience of this being would allow me to feel perfectly represented I don't have to plead a case I don't have to persuade anyone that my in things were pure these things are already known to this being it would be known that I never doubted God's existence out of rebellion or spite or disregard for Authority it would be known that I'd have preferred the existence of a loving God all along and would have had no problem obeying the commands of this loving God but I just found too many problems inherent in the concept too many contradictions too many holes too many propositions that require special pleading or circular reasoning or add Hawks speculation and then I simply didn't observe anything about reality they couldn't have been the result of natural cumulative processes it would be known that my cognitive faculties do not allow me to choose what I am and am not convinced is true about reality that my disbelief is an involuntary reaction to what I perceived as a deficit of evidence for God's existence and most importantly it would be known that I thought it insufficient and even play moral to pretend that I believed in this being simply because I feared punishment or sought reward and when I take into consideration what follows naturally from the knowledge attributed to this being and I combine that with what follows naturally from The Compassion attributed to this being it's difficult for me to conceive that this being wouldn't be in some sense proud of me and pleased with the did I have employed the intellect and the moral sense with which he would have endowed me even if it turned out that I was wrong I have a hard time imagining that this God would be offended by me and my thought process offended enough to allow for me to endure unbearable torment for all of eternity and not as a form of discipline or correction or Redemption since it never ends there's nothing constructive about hell you don't come out of hell a better person you don't come out at all and so the only reason for the existence of such a thing would be Vengeance of course according to the Bible and according to most Christians hell is exactly where I'm headed no matter the life I lead the choices I make the intentions that I have if I don't at least think that a God exists well sucks for me and in the meantime you know extreme rapists and murderers and child molesters are welcome to heaven with open arms so long what's the accepted Jesus Christ as their personal savior before their demise and if it turns out that this is the case and that's okay too because I I don't know how I would be able to handle spending eternity alongside a being whose idea of compassion and fairness makes me sick to my stomach a being who is empathy would be so easily trumped by his vanity so that's my answer good thing I'm not wrong
