00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.280
imagine yourself relaxing at home one day when&nbsp;
you suddenly hear a knock at the front door to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.660
your amazement it appears to be none other than&nbsp;
John de Lancie himself standing on your doorstep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.410
hello he says my name is Q from the Q continuum&nbsp;
just stopping by to let you know that I'm an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.780
omnipotent God you should probably start bowing&nbsp;
before me or else I might get really upset that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.700
cool you think you've never met an omnipotent&nbsp;
being before but hey he seems like a pretty honest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.650
guy and you're probably not very keen on the&nbsp;
idea of getting turned into a frog right now so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.740
naturally you take him completely at his word and&nbsp;
start bowing right that second am i right no of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.950
course not you're skeptical maybe this person is&nbsp;
telling you the truth or maybe this person is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.020
some weirdo pulling your leg so you demand some&nbsp;
basic empirical evidence to show that this being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.380
really is what he says he is all right he says you&nbsp;
want proof you got it the next thing you know mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.750
Q snaps his fingers and in a brilliant flash&nbsp;
of light your car is suddenly transformed into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.000
a giant pile of squirrels it's a very impressive&nbsp;
trick to be sure and maybe even enough to warrant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.220
a sincere placation of this being however we're&nbsp;
all hard-nosed philosophers around here and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.170
want to be as sure as we possibly can so let's&nbsp;
put this guy to the test and see whether or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.470
he truly deserves the title of omnipotent rather&nbsp;
than say really really awesome and powerful you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.490
might be forgiven for thinking that this was&nbsp;
a perfectly straightforward question to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.010
and in any other context it probably would be but&nbsp;
religious philosophy has a really funny habit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.860
tripping all over itself whenever questions like&nbsp;
this crop up because as simple and intuitive as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.800
this problem may seem most religious philosophers&nbsp;
cannot for the life of themselves seem to answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.720
it coherently it's an elegant little thought&nbsp;
experiment that perfectly captures the bizarre&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.520
mental gymnastics of Christian apologetics as&nbsp;
well as some of the foundational failings of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.620
their entire philosophical world it's also a&nbsp;
really fun exercise in basic critical thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.570
skill that takes us over a surprisingly broad&nbsp;
spectrum of interesting philosophical subjects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.430
that's why I personally find this question to&nbsp;
be so strangely fascinating and why I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.770
you'll enjoy following me down the looming rap&nbsp;
whole that it represents to begin our analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.180
let's frame the question in terms of something&nbsp;
a little more mundane rather than claim to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.790
full-on omnipotent deity suppose instead that&nbsp;
our stranger merely claims to be a reasonably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.730
competent automobile mechanic it's basically the&nbsp;
exact same situation as before but now framed in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.970
completely non religious context so ask yourself&nbsp;
now how exactly should we go about verifying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.590
this claim after all it's not like we just take&nbsp;
random people completely at their word for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.140
stuff there's real money at stake here plus the&nbsp;
functionality of our cars surely there must be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.930
some sort of test we can offer before honoring him&nbsp;
with such a title right obviously the answer is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.880
yes and it works like this go and get out a piece&nbsp;
of paper and write the following words at the top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.090
things that a competent automobile mechanic should&nbsp;
be able to do after that you just enumerate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.940
list with a collection of pertinent challenges for&nbsp;
example number one change a tire number two change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.990
oil number three flush coolant number four and so&nbsp;
on until you've completely populated the list once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.430
finished you can then issue your challenge&nbsp;
in the following fashion dear mr. stranger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.890
given the proper tools workspace assistance etc&nbsp;
I challenge you to complete each of these items&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.780
on my list within a reasonable amount of time or&nbsp;
if the list happens to be infinite in length then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.870
at least complete a reasonable sampling of items&nbsp;
until I'm satisfied they're done if our subject is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.140
successful then great is officially earned himself&nbsp;
the title of competent automobile mechanic and if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.780
not then oh well maybe he's just pretty good with&nbsp;
cars or perhaps halfway decent that's fine too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.480
they're just words and labels now to be fair this&nbsp;
isn't exactly how we go about our daily lives but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.010
it does illustrate an important philosophical&nbsp;
aspect over the nature of language doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.490
lawyers presidents squirrels rocks potatoes&nbsp;
Thor all just labels that we define and assign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.890
in accordance with a distinct set of empirically&nbsp;
verifiable properties anything that demonstrates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.900
the properties of a given list may officially earn&nbsp;
the corresponding title while things which fail to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.720
satisfy those properties are simply not referred&nbsp;
to as such it's basically a form of philosophical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.940
verification ISM and it presents a foundational&nbsp;
pillar on which human language operates with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.520
in mind let's go back to our supposedly omnipotent&nbsp;
friend mr. Q start by getting out a piece of paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.460
and writing the following words at the top things&nbsp;
that an omnipotent being should be able to do what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.130
items go on the list now the answer it turns&nbsp;
out depends a lot on who you ask for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.190
according to one school of thought the answer&nbsp;
is pretty simple anything literally anything you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.970
can think of goes on the list make it rain frogs&nbsp;
check create a married bachelor you got it flarg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.390
alas nuffin sure why not this is a naive form of&nbsp;
omnipotence commonly referred to as absolutism or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.430
absolute omnipotence Rene Descartes was a famous&nbsp;
defender of this position and even some modern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.600
philosophers have periodically defended it as well&nbsp;
it's actually pretty easy to see where this idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.600
comes from given that the Bible itself practically&nbsp;
screams this interpretation at you for instance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:29.830
Matthew 19:26 mark 10 27 Luke 1:37 job 42 - and&nbsp;
Philippians 4:13 despite its intuitive basis in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.560
Christian scripture the idea of absolutism is&nbsp;
clearly riddled with problems for example take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.650
the challenge of flogging a snuffin according to&nbsp;
absolutism mr. Q here should be perfectly capable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.220
of doing exactly that without a second thought yet&nbsp;
it should be obvious by now floral and snuffin are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.920
just gibberish words I made up out of nothing&nbsp;
they have no established definition so pray tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.050
what exactly could our subject ever do that would&nbsp;
satisfy the challenge bear in mind now that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.020
is not a limitation on our subject per se but a&nbsp;
simple problem of language it's like mashing my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.270
keyboard with random characters and saying here&nbsp;
do this there's simply nothing to do I may as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.940
well just stand there in silence or perhaps shrug&nbsp;
my shoulders and grunt mr. Q cannot ever hope to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.030
fulfill a challenge if no coherent challenge was&nbsp;
actually given notice that a similar argument also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.220
applies to the challenge of creating a married&nbsp;
bachelor by definition a bachelor is an unmarried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.230
man which means the creation of a married bachelor&nbsp;
is the same thing as creating a married man who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.930
is also not married a logical contradiction the&nbsp;
set of all things that are married is mutually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.130
exclusive to the set of all things that are&nbsp;
not married that therefore it doesn't matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.410
what mr. queue ever presents to me because the&nbsp;
rules of logic forbid me from ever recognizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.990
a successful outcome again that's not a limitation&nbsp;
on our subject but another limitation on language&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.560
itself the very words used to formulate the&nbsp;
challenge are simply put together wrongly this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.050
is exactly why absolutism is generally regarded as&nbsp;
a pretty terrible form of omnipotence nevertheless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.870
it is important to recognize that the death of&nbsp;
absolutism does not necessarily imply the death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.660
of God all it says is that whatever things are&nbsp;
out there for us to give labels to none of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.480
will ever be able to demonstrate omnipotence to&nbsp;
any rational satisfaction and since no being can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.760
ever possibly earn itself such a title even&nbsp;
in principle the title itself is essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.850
meaningless if however we simply redefine on&nbsp;
evidence to mean something slightly different then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.520
all of the problems we just talked about would&nbsp;
immediately vanish in a puff of logic remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.370
now that all we're trying to do here at the end of&nbsp;
the day is define a word if that word is coherent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:51.040
logical and verifiable then great we can use it&nbsp;
to describe various entities in our environment if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.560
and when we ever happen to encounter them but if&nbsp;
the word is incoherent or logically inconsistent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.830
then oh well it's not like the universe cares one&nbsp;
way or the other all it means is that we can't use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.960
the word to meaningfully describe stuff time to&nbsp;
go back to the drawing board and see if we can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.000
think of something better much to the credit&nbsp;
of religious philosophers today that seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.880
be exactly what happened rather than literally&nbsp;
be capable of doing anything a far more common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.970
view of omnipotence is the ability to do all&nbsp;
that is logically possible it's a perfectly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:30.310
straightforward revision that specifically seeks&nbsp;
to avoid the incoherence of absolutism while still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.830
preserving the totality of power we've come to&nbsp;
expect and that's a good thing so let's all get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.680
out a piece of paper and write the following words&nbsp;
at the top logically possible actions what exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.050
does this mean how do we determine whether or not&nbsp;
some particular task should go on the list here's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:53.370
how I interpret it consider a simple challenge&nbsp;
like eita taco if i can imagine some logically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.560
possible world wherein that task is being&nbsp;
performed by some agent then good it goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.470
on the list for example I can imagine a logically&nbsp;
possible world where it is true that the President&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:10.290
of the United States is eating a taco therefore&nbsp;
it seems to me it must be logically possible to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:16.530
eat a taco it is officially something that can be&nbsp;
done and therefore it must go on the list anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:21.630
that wishes to call itself omnipotent must have&nbsp;
therefore be able to replicate that feat that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:27.150
was easy enough so let's shake things up a bit by&nbsp;
asking a very simple question is it or is it not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:33.480
logically possible to tell a lie obviously the&nbsp;
answer has to be yes because people around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.140
world tell lies all the time therefore by modal&nbsp;
axiom B it must be logically possible to tell a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:46.860
lie therefore by the definition of omnipotence&nbsp;
all omnipotent beings must be able to tell lies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.920
strangely enough however the Holy Christian Bible&nbsp;
says outright that lying is something God cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:00.150
do not just something that God doesn't do or&nbsp;
chooses not to do but literally cannot do see for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:07.560
example Titus 1:2 or Hebrews 6:18 so right off the&nbsp;
bat the very definition offered by professional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:13.350
Christian philosophers themselves has immediately&nbsp;
precluded their very own God from being omnipotent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:18.150
isn't that funny but let's ignore that little&nbsp;
problem anyway and see what else we can find wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.880
with this definition how about this go outside&nbsp;
and start collecting rocks into a giant pile keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.200
piling up rocks until the pile is so heavy that&nbsp;
you cannot ever hope to lift them congratulations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.000
you have just created a finite pile of rocks&nbsp;
that officially satisfies the description of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.060
being unlifted bull by its own maker therefore&nbsp;
it must be logically possible to create a pile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.760
of rocks or even a single rock that satisfies the&nbsp;
description of being unlifted oh by its own maker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.640
therefore all omnipotent beings must be able to&nbsp;
replicate this task so let's pose the challenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.360
shall we dear mr. Q I challenge you to create a&nbsp;
finite Rock such that its own maker cannot lift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.760
it go so far so good right but what happens if&nbsp;
mr. Q actually succeeds in this challenge after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.670
all last time I checked it is always logically&nbsp;
possible to lift a finite Rock notice how this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.050
is just a simple variation on the paradox&nbsp;
of the stone can God create a rock so heavy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.790
that even God himself cannot lift it it's a famous&nbsp;
philosophical challenge to the idea of omnipotence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:25.190
because it logically prevents any being from&nbsp;
ever demonstrating such a property by definition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.590
all omnipotent beings must at any given moment&nbsp;
possess the power to both create rocks and to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:35.720
lift rocks subject to certain specifications yet&nbsp;
the moment our subject creates a rock he cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.840
lift he cannot possibly satisfy the definition of&nbsp;
omnipotence anymore that means no being can ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.180
possibly earn the title of omnipotence because&nbsp;
the very act of proving it requires them to not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.400
have it notice also that we could just as easily&nbsp;
frame this exact same problem any number of ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.470
for example one of my personal favorites is to&nbsp;
stand before a podium and truthfully speak the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:03.560
words I am NOT omnipotent again it's a perfectly&nbsp;
logical task in that I can imagine a logically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.880
possible world where this is taking place&nbsp;
therefore at any given moment and omnipotent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:14.540
being must by definition be able to replicate&nbsp;
that task stand before a podium and truthfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:21.080
speak the words I am NOT omnipotent unfortunately&nbsp;
the only way to actually possess such a power is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:27.140
by not being omnipotent bear in mind now that&nbsp;
this is not some clever philosophical trick but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:33.740
a fundamental property of binary propositional&nbsp;
logic self referential propositions when coupled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.710
with logical negations tend to produce really&nbsp;
goofy inconsistencies it's the exact same reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:45.500
why we have so many other famous paradoxes as&nbsp;
well for example the liars paradox Russell's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:51.380
paradox the halting problem and even girdle's&nbsp;
incompleteness theorems are all just similar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.720
manifestations of self referential negation&nbsp;
so it's not like I'm just making this stuff up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.510
because philosophers logicians and mathematicians&nbsp;
have been studying this exact same phenomenon for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:07.700
centuries we therefore must conclude that the&nbsp;
capacity to do all that as logically possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:14.900
is ironically not a logical possibility you can&nbsp;
either be complete or you can be consistent but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:20.790
you cannot have both simultaneously at this point&nbsp;
you would think that most Christians would simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.920
say something like y-yes that seems to be a bit&nbsp;
of an issue perhaps my conception of omnipotence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.560
is just a little bit too greedy let's maybe learn&nbsp;
from the last hundred years of mathematical logic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.690
and see if we can't find something a little less&nbsp;
contradictory but of course the exact opposite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:41.520
is generally true with haqq philosophers around&nbsp;
the world dogmatically clinging to their precious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.350
definition anyway for instance one complaint&nbsp;
that you might hear is how the challenge itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:52.770
is inherently ambiguous when I create a rock the&nbsp;
word maker refers to myself the person speaking to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:58.530
you right now yet when someone else performs the&nbsp;
same task the meaning of maker suddenly changes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.620
other words the challenge shares the same type of&nbsp;
proposition but not the same token thus in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.930
for the challenge to be comparable mr. Q would not&nbsp;
need to create a rock that he cannot lift but only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:15.750
create a rock that I cannot lift this may sound&nbsp;
like a somewhat reasonable point at first but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.970
quickly falls apart the moment you actually stop&nbsp;
and think about it for starters we don't have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.230
use the word maker if we don't want to we could&nbsp;
have challenged our subject to create a rock so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:30.330
heavy that no being in the universe could lift it&nbsp;
or better yet stand before a podium in truthfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:36.000
state the proposition that there are no omnipotent&nbsp;
beings there's still logically possible actions in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.150
some logically possible world which means they&nbsp;
still have to go on the list the real problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:48.750
however is that all actions are inherently self&nbsp;
referential 2cy simply imagine what would happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:54.360
if I challenged you right now to eat a taco&nbsp;
naturally if you're like most people the obvious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.190
interpretation of that task is to immediately&nbsp;
grab a taco and start shoving it into your face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:05.220
if however you were to then challenged me to&nbsp;
replicate that task what exactly do you imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:12.390
happening next do I begin shoving a taco into my&nbsp;
own face or must I literally shove a second taco&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:18.870
into your face and force you to eat it obviously&nbsp;
the former interpretation is the correct viewpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:24.270
because that's how every english-speaking human&nbsp;
on the planet understands it the only point of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:28.740
issuing a challenge like this in the first place&nbsp;
is to see if you have the power within yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:35.680
to replicate a power that I had within myself yet&nbsp;
for some strange reason the moment we try to apply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.820
this same line of Reason within a religious&nbsp;
philosophical context then all of a sudden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:45.910
people start acting like a bunch of pedantic&nbsp;
morons by invoking the type token distinction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:51.400
in this way it is literally meaningless for me to&nbsp;
challenge you to eat a taco I have to instead say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:58.480
something horribly obtuse like I challenge you&nbsp;
to bring about the event of you eating this taco&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.210
well I'm sorry guys but events are not the same&nbsp;
thing as actions and I should not have to specify&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:11.410
a particular act or in order to coherently define&nbsp;
some particular act when you challenge me to jump&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:17.140
five feet in the air you obviously mean that I&nbsp;
have to propel myself with my own legs off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:23.020
ground beneath me if however I then challenge&nbsp;
you to jump five feet in the air then obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:30.610
you must now propel yourself off the ground with&nbsp;
your legs all logically possible actions are in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:37.330
some way or another inherently self referential&nbsp;
deal with it with that taken care of the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:42.520
most common objection I tend to hear is that&nbsp;
omnipotence doesn't really mean the ability to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.470
do all that is logically possible rather it&nbsp;
means something more like the ability to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:54.310
all that is consistent with one's nature that&nbsp;
is to say if the proposition Y is doing X is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.310 --> 00:17:02.140
logically self consistent then for an omnipotent&nbsp;
being it will always be true that Y can do X ok&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.700
fair enough if you want to just summarily change&nbsp;
the definition of omnipotence again then that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.800
great it was a bad definition from the beginning&nbsp;
and we can only grow as philosophers by trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:17.110
to find something better but can we please all be&nbsp;
grown-up enough to admit that this is nothing more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:23.020
than an indirect admission of defeat the previous&nbsp;
definition was inherently flawed and so now we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:28.210
changing it into something else yet whenever&nbsp;
I talk to Christian apologists about this they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.470
almost always pretend as if the new definition&nbsp;
is really what it was supposed to be all along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:39.100
and how dare I strawman such brilliant thinkers&nbsp;
by ever suggesting otherwise fine whatever let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.790
just roll with it and see what we can find this&nbsp;
time shot we can an omnipotent being tell a lie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:51.450
or what typically the answer to this question&nbsp;
is that it depends on the being for example the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:57.000
god of Christianity cannot tell a lie because&nbsp;
doing so would contradict his perfectly honest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.550
nature thus to ask God to tell a lie is the&nbsp;
logical equivalent to asking a perfectly honest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:08.820
being - not to be perfectly honest apparently a&nbsp;
logical contradiction but don't worry God still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.140
gets to be omnipotent anyway because he can still&nbsp;
do all the things that are consistent with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:19.110
divine unchanging nature likewise God cannot stand&nbsp;
before a podium and shout I am NOT omnipotent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.700
because that would produce a contradiction as&nbsp;
well omnipotence is an inherent part of God's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:29.880
nature so therefore it doesn't have to go on a&nbsp;
list of things that God can do BAM problem solved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.740
this is usually the part where I begin to lose&nbsp;
all patience with religious philosophers because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:41.010
responses like this are clearly not well thought&nbsp;
out it really gets under my skin too because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:46.500
represents a profound laziness that makes no&nbsp;
effort whatsoever to consider the practical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:52.980
implications of what is actually being said to&nbsp;
illustrate simply imagine God himself standing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.980 --> 00:19:00.270
on my doorstep in all his glory when I issued the&nbsp;
following challenge dear God I challenge you right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:07.680
now to tell me a lie tell me that you're a potato&nbsp;
go pray tell what exactly do Christians imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.630
happening next because as far as I can tell they&nbsp;
seem to imagine something like that scene from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:18.300
liar liar where Jim Carrey tries to say that the&nbsp;
pen is red but just can't bring himself to do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:24.780
as if some invisible metaphysical force of honesty&nbsp;
is somehow preventing the words from coming out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:30.330
his mouth call me crazy but I hardly find that&nbsp;
to be consistent with the idea of unlimited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:35.430
potentiality or maybe Christians just imagined God&nbsp;
standing there with a dumb look on his face as if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.480
he didn't even understand the question or what&nbsp;
if he just says I'm sorry but that would violate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.550
my essential nature no thanks what in the hell&nbsp;
am I supposed to do with that but let's take it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:50.250
one step further suppose you challenge me to lift&nbsp;
a thousand pound car over my head oh except that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:56.190
I'm sorry that would violate my essential nature&nbsp;
you see I'm a beam comprised physical muscle mass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:01.830
that can only lift 200 pounds when you ask me&nbsp;
to lift a thousand pounds you're asking me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:07.680
perform a contradiction a being that cannot lift&nbsp;
more than 200 pounds is lifting more than 200&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.590
pounds not only that but any challenge you give&nbsp;
me can be counteracted in the exact same way no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:21.060
being can logically be expected to do the things&nbsp;
it cannot do so congratulations my dear Christians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.310
you've solved the omnipotence paradox all you&nbsp;
had to do was replace it with the omnipotence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:32.460
tautology literally anything and everything in&nbsp;
the universe is now omnipotent because nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:38.640
can ever logically do the things it cannot do&nbsp;
aha I hear you saying it is only incidental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.950
that you cannot lift a thousand pounds I can still&nbsp;
imagine a possible world wherein you are lifting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:49.140
a thousand pounds over your head therefore it&nbsp;
may be logically possible but not physically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:55.650
possible actually no what you're imagining right&nbsp;
now isn't me it may be an entity very similar to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:00.570
me but that's not really me because as we just&nbsp;
established I am NOT a being who can lift a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:06.210
thousand pounds over my head or better yet let's&nbsp;
just play that same game in Reverse I can imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:12.630
a possible world wherein God is telling a lie&nbsp;
now what what's the difference why is lying a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:18.210
violation of God's essential nature but lifting&nbsp;
a thousand pounds is totally consistent with mine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.890
because as far as I can tell this entire line&nbsp;
of reasoning appears to be nothing more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:28.740
blatant special pleading when God can't do a thing&nbsp;
then it must be because it violates his essential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.510
nature yet when I can't do a thing and apparently&nbsp;
it's little more than a conditional happenstance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:39.840
of my feeble limited existence so once again we&nbsp;
have another example of responding to an argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.060
without any effort to actually address the&nbsp;
argument but the thing I find absolutely hilarious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:51.750
about this new definition is how of all people&nbsp;
the famous apologist Alvin Plantinga himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:58.170
personally debunked it as far back as the 1960s&nbsp;
all you have to do is imagine a man called mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:04.860
Mick ear who just so happens to have one essential&nbsp;
property he has only the power to scratch his ear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:11.160
and nothing else thus by definition any other&nbsp;
task you challenge him to complete as a logical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.890
violation of his essential nature hardly an&nbsp;
all-powerful being wouldn't you say yet according&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:24.330
to our new definition mr. McKee ear is still just&nbsp;
as omnipotent as Almighty God himself all tangents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:30.570
aside the real problem with this whole essential&nbsp;
nature business is just that essentialism the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.070
idea that there exists some kind of intrinsic&nbsp;
essence to things which makes them what they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:40.050
it's a perfectly natural bias through which human&nbsp;
beings tend to look at the world but it's still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:45.750
completely bogus ever since the Greek philosopher&nbsp;
Plutarch introduced the Theseus paradox back in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:50.580
the 1st century philosophers have had very good&nbsp;
reasons to reject essentialism as a worthless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:57.090
incoherent concept a chair does not have some&nbsp;
magically objective essence of chair ness that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:01.800
makes it a chair it's just some arrangement of&nbsp;
physical material stuff that human beings have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.800
arbitrarily decided to sit on and call a chair&nbsp;
likewise there is no such thing as essence of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:13.020
godliness that would make God God rather there&nbsp;
is only a distinct collection of empirically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:20.280
verifiable properties which if demonstrated would&nbsp;
earn some lucky entity the official title of God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.930
so not only do we have Christians pushing yet&nbsp;
another idea of omnipotence that just doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.070
work but it's grounded on philosophical&nbsp;
presumptions that have been categorically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:35.430
debunked for almost 2,000 years however it really&nbsp;
needs to be emphasized that all of these crazy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.920
problems would vanish in a heartbeat if only&nbsp;
the Christians would just stop insisting on such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.290
bungled definitions it's sad too because it's&nbsp;
really not that hard to come up with something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:52.620
relatively functional so let's do the theists job&nbsp;
for them and just define omnipotence in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:59.670
isn't stupid shall we omnipotence the capacity to&nbsp;
create destroy and rearrange matter and energy in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:06.780
accordance with arbitrary whims they're done if we&nbsp;
ever encounter any being with this kind of power I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:12.600
will be more than happy to refer to such a being&nbsp;
as omnipotent and he create rocks sure can he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.810
lift rocks absolutely but can he create a rock so&nbsp;
heavy that even its own maker cannot lift it nope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:24.810
not a chance but guess what that's perfectly okay&nbsp;
because still logically consistent with the stated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:31.290
definition notice how a definition like this also&nbsp;
solves all kinds of goofy philosophical issues for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:36.660
example one lesser-known problem with omnipotence&nbsp;
is the problem of creating two omnipotent beings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.640
at once so let's imagine a possible world wearing&nbsp;
two beings are both competing for the official&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:47.160
title of omnipotent deity all we have to do is&nbsp;
make a game out of it challenge one guy to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.470
my car into a pile of squirrels while challenging&nbsp;
the other guy to turn it into a sack of potatoes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:57.180
whichever outcome occurs will then determine which&nbsp;
guy is the loser and which guy earns the title&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:03.360
done or better yet let's consider another lesser&nbsp;
known problem I challenge you to truthfully tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.520
me what I ate for dinner last year you'll notice&nbsp;
that this is not really so much a test of power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.740
but rather a test of knowledge yet according to&nbsp;
most classical definitions for omnipotence there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:19.110
is no distinction the omnipotent being must be&nbsp;
able to do it because I formulated the challenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:24.990
as a logically coherent action if however we adopt&nbsp;
the new definition then it is now possible for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:31.110
being to be omnipotent but not necessarily&nbsp;
omniscient all-powerful and all-knowing are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:36.780
now philosophically distinct concepts as we&nbsp;
should reasonably expect them to be notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.700
also of how there are still many possible ways to&nbsp;
potentially break the definition for example could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.960
an omnipotent being create another omnipotent&nbsp;
being or what if I challenge the being to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:51.420
itself would that violate the definition maybe&nbsp;
maybe not but you'll notice I'm not racking my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:58.020
brain with obtuse rationalizations just to protect&nbsp;
a stupid definition if it works then great and if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:04.110
not then oh well we'll just think of something&nbsp;
better later the ultimate irony in this entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:09.810
discussion is that when all is said and done I'm&nbsp;
basically just fixing the theists philosophical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:15.810
problems for them yet if past experience is any&nbsp;
guide the overwhelming majority of them will never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:20.940
see it that way instead they'll probably view&nbsp;
this entire discussion as a literal attack on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:27.990
God himself as if the words used to describe some&nbsp;
possible entity might have real power over whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:33.120
or not it actually exists that's what happens&nbsp;
when you live your life defending Dogma rather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.550
than honestly searching for a better understand of&nbsp;
the world but the thing I find really embarrassing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:43.530
about this entire debate is that by clinging to&nbsp;
their philosophically warped definitions it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:48.990
the Christians themselves who are logically&nbsp;
forcing their God squarely into the realm of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:54.990
non-existence even if there were a god-like thing&nbsp;
somewhere out there in the cosmos for us to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:54.990 --> 00:27:01.560
the rules of language would prevent us from ever&nbsp;
rationally calling it such thanks for listening
