00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.250
For nearly all of American history
Christianity has enjoyed undisputed

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.360
dominance over mainstream culture and
media. But with the arrival of the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.290
Information Age the status has begun to
falter as more and more believers find

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.369
themselves falling away from the base of
their parents Christian apologetics have

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.000
therefore organized a dedicated campaign
of lectures and debates in order to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.140
publicly defend their faith and preserve
their status it's a crucial aspect of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.070
our politically charged culture war with
far-reaching social consequences after

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.630
all if God is real especially the
Christian God then we owe it to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.230
ourselves to understand this God and
worship Him as best as we can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.250
it means the Holy Bible is the pure and
righteous Word of God and we all need to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.000
start praying and studying lest we find
ourselves rotting in eternal torment

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.129
after this life is over however if God
is not real then it means that millions

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.600
upon millions of our friends family
members neighbors and countrymen are all

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.980
taking part in a massive self-inflicted
delusion a delusion that not only

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
demands time money and sacrifice to
sustain itself but also the political

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.950
authority to legally impose itself on
everyone else all of us everywhere have

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.580
a serious stake in this issue and would
do well to understand it as best as we

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.400
can
I'm a professional scientist and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.540
engineer with a doctorate of philosophy
from an accredited American University I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.799
have several publications in refereed
journals and I make a decent living by

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.030
solving problems and pushing the limits
of human understanding it's a matter of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.380
professional interest that I understand
what it means to test my beliefs against

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.820
the dictates of reality and to correct
them when nature tells me I'm wrong I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.930
have no personal stake in any of the
beliefs I hold but simply in the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.579
rational assurance that whatever beliefs
I do hold are indeed correspondent with

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.430
reality
I therefore measure my beliefs through a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.380
well-defined set of epistemic rules and
I make no exceptions under any context

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.219
that's what it takes to make new
discoveries and build the knowledge of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.770
humanity
yet when it comes to religious

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.070
affiliation you don't have to bother
with any of that stuff at all your

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.119
beliefs are practically decided for you
at birth and then ground it on little

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.080
more than tradition naive intuition
social pressure and authority

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.099
why else would religious faiths around
the world segregate into such distinct

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.540
cultural and geographic boundaries this
is entirely unheard of in the world of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.650
physical and mathematical science but
it's practically a defining feature in

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.129
the world of religion it's a dead
giveaway that when all is said and done

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.329
religious belief has nothing to do with
an objective understanding of reality

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.890
but instead is a purely cultural
phenomenon of human making ordinarily

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.930
this would not be so terrible except for
one problem by its very nature religion

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.730
and especially Christianity is never
satisfied with merely sitting back and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.959
enjoying a life of quiet worship
Christian doctrine itself requires

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.980
believers to spread the word to everyone
else and even threatens them with

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.239
eternal damnation should they ever
desert the cost this problem is further

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.579
amplified by a constant push to exercise
legal force as a blunt instrument for

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.569
imposing a narrow interpretation of
Christian morality on to the rest of the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.569
nation
intelligent design traditional marriage

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.829
abortion and abstinence only education
are just a handful of the current

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.880
political controversies that are heavily
motivated by the religious convictions

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.290
of Christian conservatives so if there's
any truth to this stuff at all then it's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.400
a good idea to find out what that truth
is so we can make good decisions

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.569
accordingly and if not then abandon
those beliefs and correct them so we can

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.550
stop wasting political capital on
pointless dogmatic superstitions that's

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.360
why I feel personally compelled to
understand this controversy as best as I

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.560
can and to share my professional
insights with the rest of the world not

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.700
just to casually analyze a few political
and philosophical arguments but to

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.000
critically expose the very core of what
it is that Christian apologetics

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.349
ultimately represent it's important to
realize that the debate on God's

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.040
existence is more than just a
philosophical controversy between

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.930
academic egos it's a battle over the
very rules of epistemology itself

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.250
because in the world of science if you
expect to build a reliable understanding

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.150
of reality then beliefs must be
rigorously justified in accordance to

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.169
very explicit requirements before they
can ever promote the status of knowledge

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.549
but when it comes to religion there are
no epistemic rules to speak of no one

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.330
converts to Christianity through the
pure force of evidence and argumentation

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.070
but plenty of people do convert because
of tradition upbringing and social

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.000
pressure so for christian apologetics
the goal is not really to convince

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.100
non-believers through brute intellectual
force rather the only meaningful goal of

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.150
apologetics is to rationalize the
validity of a preconceived conclusion in

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.770
order to slow the ever-increasing tide
of apostasy they do this with good

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.620
reason
- there's big money in this stuff and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.820
even tremendous political power but it
only works as long as you can maintain a

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.169
reliable pool of gullible believers to
support you that's what makes education

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.000
and outspoken criticism so crucial in
this controversy it's the only way to

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.870
break the cycle of belief and disrupt
the political machine that works so hard

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.190
to intrude on our lives this is also why
religious groups around the world fight

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.870
so hard to indoctrinate children at such
young ages it's a deliberate ploy

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.150
designed to unite religious affiliation
with personal and social identity giving

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.840
up one's religion is never as simple as
casually admitting some trivial

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.800
cognitive error but the psychological
equivalent of cutting off an entire arm

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.190
or a lake religious criticism is
therefore often met with a

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.690
hypersensitive irrational resistance
such that many believers will flatly

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.110
refuse to ever change their my
any condition whatsoever for example and

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:49.110
my view here is that the way in which I
know Christianity is true is first and

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.760
foremost on the basis of the witness of
the Holy Spirit in my heart and that

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.770
this gives me a sailfin Takei ting means
of knowing that Christianity is true

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.920
wholly apart from the evidence and
therefore if in some historically

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.700
contingent circumstances the evidence
that I have available to me should turn

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.250
against Christianity I don't think that
that controverts the witness of the Holy

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.650
Spirit this may sound like a harmless
assertion of spiritual faith but it's

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.330
also an open admission that facts simply
don't matter that subjective personal

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.290
experiences supersede any and all
physical evidence which may ever emerge

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.490
to the contrary remember that these are
the exact same people who want the rest

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.590
of us to believe as they do and live as
they do people who objective use to even

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.270
admit the mere possibility of error in
their beliefs yet insist on legislating

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.530
their spiritually based morality onto
the entire nation rather than engage the

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.550
discussion sincerely and work together
to formulate a functional understanding

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.140
of our universe Christian apologetics
whether they realize it or not are far

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.460
more interested in engineering
conformity to a foregone conclusion so

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.060
if we're going to take the issue of
God's existence seriously then we need

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.930
to remind ourselves that the actual
existence of God himself is not

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.600
important if he's real then great let's
believe in him and worship Him and study

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.480
him to the best of our ability but if
God is not real then that's great too we

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.260
can stop wasting our time at boring
sermons on Sunday start making better

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.360
use of our short mortal lives all that
matters is that whatever beliefs we do

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.730
hold those same beliefs can justifiably
reflect reality it's a bitter pill of

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.690
humility to be sure
but if truth matters then we should all

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.940
be able to agree on this much at least
now to be fair Christians do possess a

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.260
whole slew of impressive sounding
arguments for God's existence but their

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.600
entire position boils down to just that
arguments they're empty words shrouded

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.980
in a thin veil of philosophical jargon
without any verifiable power in the real

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.910
world that's why it's so easy to
discredit each and every argument that

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.480
Christians have ever come up with
because in the world of science when we

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.900
want to convince people of a
controversial idea no one ever bothers

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.160
with cutesie philosophical rhetoric we
make testable predictions and present

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.110
our findings so despite the huge volumes
of sophisticated philosophical posturing

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.580
no Christian apologetic has ever
provided a single verifiable instance of

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.620
any supernatural force manifesting in
our real physical world it's as if the

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.760
entire Christian apologetic tradition is
built on the naive supposition that

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:34.370
merely concluding God is the same thing
as demonstrating him so please join me

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.930
as together we dissect the great beast
of Christian apologetics not just

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.710
because we have a bone to pick with
Christianity per se but because

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.280
Christianity is simply the most well
organized and focused of all the

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.630
apologetic tradition doing so brings us
face to face with the very foundations

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.590
of knowledge itself and forces us to
enumerate the most basic rules of

00:08:54.590 --> 00:09:00.080
epistemology in a concise unambiguous
template only by basing our beliefs on a

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.100
functional reflection of reality can we
ever expect our decisions to have a

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:09.080
positive impact in the real world it's a
simple practical question about how

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.970
exactly we intend to justify the choices
we make are we going to rigorously hold

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.900
ourselves in accordance with strict
epistemic rules and then modify our

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.430
beliefs in the face of new ever-changing
information or are we going to measure

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.150
our beliefs through the lens of cultural
traditions and subjective personal

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.770
perceptions never changing them under
any conditions to speak up the answer we

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.570
choose as a nation and as a species will
have the measurable repercussions for

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.320
years to come
