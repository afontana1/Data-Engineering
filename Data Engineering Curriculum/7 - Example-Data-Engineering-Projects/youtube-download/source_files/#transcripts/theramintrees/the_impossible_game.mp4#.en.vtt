00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.540
You're out in the middle of nowhere.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.540
You're told the truth is out there — 
you just have to search for it.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
There's a bewildering number of signposts 
around you, each claiming to be the right way.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.040
You pick a direction — or more likely
have it picked for you — and start walking.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.680
You walk for miles, but there are no gods.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.050
Occasionally, you meet people along the
way who say you chose the right direction —

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.310
although they can never say how far you
have to go.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.170
After many miles, the truth finally dawns on you.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.130
There are people in every single direction, 
who'll tell you exactly the same thing:

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.430
their path is the right one, 
and you just have to keep walking.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.070
It now becomes clear the task is impossible.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.410
You have a limited number
of years in your life.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.910
You could spend them all 
walking in the same futile direction.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.800
You could spend them all 
trying multiple futile directions,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.090
and obviously the length of time you
spend on each journey

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.710
is divided by the number of directions you try.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.980
It's impossible to investigate
every idea in any depth,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.760
so requiring any depth of investigation
sets an impossible condition.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.740
What's being proposed is a game of pure chance.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.800
You could say my atheism is
a refusal to play an impossible game.
