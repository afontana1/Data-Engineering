00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.640
Over the last few years, it's been really exciting to see the emergence of strong ex-Muslim voices.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.180
They've been some of the most marginalized voices on the world stage.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.060
Just for leaving their religion

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.880
these individuals have risked being shunned, imprisoned, censored and killed.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
Death threats come from lone assassins, angry mobs,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.600
even state-sanctioned executions
in several Islamic countries.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.880
Imagine facing these threats just because you don't believe in the religion assigned to you at birth without your consent.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.800
Individuals who, despite these risks forge ahead and speak out face constant attempts to invalidate them.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.300
Like folks who leave Christianity, folks who leave Islam are smeared with all the same lies.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.380
It's falsely claimed they only left because of emotional reasons or bad personal experiences — implying their reasons lack substance.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.060
It's falsely claimed that they were never true members of the religion.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.840
They never believed. They were just faking it.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.160
It's also falsely claimed that they never stopped believing — they're just acting out.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.340
The contradictions in these assertions expose them for the straw clutching nonsense they are.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.100
The fact is people express entirely
rational objections for leaving Islam

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.300
based on an accurate understanding
of its scripture and its implementation.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.420
I want to recommend some channels run by people who articulate their rational objections with rigour, integrity, compassion and humour.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300
Although their focus is on Islam

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.300
these channels will speak to folks from any background who are interested in the mechanics of belief

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.560
and in the broad human themes
of freedom, authenticity, truth and justice.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.420
The masked Arab is a treasure-house of research on subjects ranging from scientific claims to miracle stories to scriptural punishments

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.400
His mask says a lot about the risks
he faces in coming out.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.000
Risks to his relationships and to his personal safety when he travels within the Muslim world.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.460
In spite of those risks

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.960
there's no masking his dry wit
and muscular sense of irony.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.540
He dives deep into the Quran and the hadith — the multi-authored accounts of the life of Islam's founder Muhammad.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.680
And, like all the best channels, he credits his audience with intelligence and a capacity for independent thinking.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.880
In his explorations of scriptural ideas and practices

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.380
he unpacks hidden layers of context, much of which would otherwise be inaccessible to non Arabic speakers

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.280
and backs it all up with video description boxes crammed with reference material.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.080
He is a fantastic communicator. Well worth watching.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.160
Abdullah Sameer was an ardent promoter of Islam for 15 years before his doubts were aroused by scriptural claims about the universe

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.680
that didn't add up.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.000
He talks about his experiences with great candour and comments hilariously on a range of bizarre scriptural assertions

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.860
including outlandish declarations about bodily functions and sanitary procedures

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.100
that bear no relation to biology or hygiene or logic.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.960
Like Muhammad's instruction to only use an odd number of stones to clean yourself after a call of nature

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.480
Other bogus claims concern rotting meat mountains shooting stars. The list goes on.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.160
As Abdullah notes, these cobbled-together superstitions lay bare the human ignorance masking itself as divine intelligence.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.640
Abdullah gives some thoughtful responses to all the common complaints that religion shouldn't be criticised and that all atheists are arrogant.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.940
The personal attacks he's experienced for leaving Islam haven't diminished his humanity

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.980
and he remains an outspoken supporter of the religious freedoms of Muslims.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.420
He's also a strong promoter of other ex-Muslim voices.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.700
In marginalised groups, invisibility breeds invisibility.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.820
When members stay silent they remain unaware of each other's existence

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.400
giving them all the illusion of aloneness.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.860
Conversely

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.100
visibility breeds visibility.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.820
As more members speak out even more members take courage to do the same.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.300
By promoting other voices, Abdullah contributes substantially to that snowball effect.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.340
And it's through him that I became
aware of Hassan Radwan.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.200
Hassan was a devout Muslim teaching in an Islamic school, publishing Islamic story books and plays

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.300
and leading a Dawah society in the UK,
exploring scripture.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.140
Hearing his fascinating story — recently updated with Arabic subtitles —

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.620
was an experience I wasn't quite prepared for.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.240
He spoke with rare and disarming openness
about a personal journey

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.860
that moved from devotion and fellowship into confusion and disillusionment

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.040
touching on some heartbreaking moments.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.400
Listening to him, it was clear this man had a huge heart.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.980
His love of people shines through all his work.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.600
It's a simple point, but one that bears repetition

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.320
Ideologies must be suspect when they profess peace love and compassion but condemn the most peaceful loving compassionate people.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.640
Hassan's specialist education makes him an authoritative commentator on scriptural morality.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.480
In a video I highly recommend

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.980
he recounts a story in the Quran about a boy who's killed —

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.240
not for anything he's done

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.360
but because Allah predicts he'll cause his parents sorrow when he grows up.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.600
Hassan explores the implications of this story

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.560
Listening to Hassan's nuanced reflections and novel responses to arguments is a pleasure I come back to time after time.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.867
The Ex-Muslims of North America has an ever-expanding roster of speakers

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:37.440
including Ali Rizvi, Sarah Haider, Muhammad Syed

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.320
Imtiaz Shams, Hiba Krisht, Ghada Ibrahim
and Armin Navabi.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.960
There's a huge breadth of experience here.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.940
Members speak about everything from their personal relationship to the hijab to the experience of converting to Islam in adult life.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.640
The group also works to initiate meaningful exchanges with Muslims.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.360
As footage on their channel shows

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.660
these encounters are frequently friendly
and bridge-building.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.220
ironically some of the most consistent hostility they experience

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.420
comes from non-muslims whose black-and-white defense of Muslims allows no space for the stories of ex-Muslims.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.400
The Ex-Muslims of North America are doing great work combating preconceptions

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.580
and preparing a softer safer landing for others.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.880
Veedu Vidz aims to beat bigotry with a smile.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.660
His irrepressible energy comes through in everything from his comedy skits to his calisthenics workout routines.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.780
But as his friendly street debates demonstrate, it's a mistake to take him lightly.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.640
He has a seriously sharp educated mind.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.520
Like Abdullah, he hosts great interviews and raises awareness of religious persecution cases —

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.100
like the imprisonment of Asia Bibi

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.920
a Christian whose troubles began when she drank from a well while working as a farm hand

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.080
and was reportedly told by some Muslim women

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.580
that her Christian faith dirtied the water

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.460
and that she could only redeem herself
by converting to Islam.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.080
The situation escalated with a mob
gathering, assaulting her

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.140
and threatening execution.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.340
And it ended in her arrest and an official death sentence

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.740
Veeda Vidz gives insightful breakdowns of cases like Asia's

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.540
asking illuminating questions

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.200
and exposing fundamental hypocrisies.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.000
He's a great social commentator —

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.260
entertaining and thought-provoking.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.760
My final recommendation is Reason On Faith.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.000
Raised in a branch of Islam called Ahmadiyya

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.320
in his early 20s, he wrote an entire book methodically listing his questions and criticisms.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.620
He had the book printed and planned to distribute copies among his community

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.360
anticipating some honest discussion.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.360
That discussion never materialised

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.680
Instead community leaders seized his copies of the book and after years of silence

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.860
said it wasn't worth a response.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.500
Since then writing anonymously on his website reasononfaith.org

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.480
he’s continued to dissect religious claims, questions and arguments.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.480
The volume of thought and research that goes into his work is staggering.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.220
What's equally striking is his compassion and empathy.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.580
His goal remains what it's always been —

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.780
establishing dialogue.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.880
Finally this year he came out announcing his departure from Islam and making his official YouTube debut.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.760
His video work embodies all the qualities
evident in his writing

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.660
eloquently unpacking a huge expense of topics from physical abuse to sexuality

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.760
to family attitudes to life after Islam.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.460
Reason On Faith is an exciting new YouTube voice.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.440
I'm looking forward to watching his channel grow.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.520
The pressure on Muslims to remain silent continues

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.580
whether it's from open intimidation

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:55.480
or the sly insinuations of unreasonableness conveyed
in rhetorical questions — like:

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.800
‘Why do ex-Muslims have to talk about Islam?’

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.300
‘Why can't they keep their departure to themselves?’

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.520
As Hassan Radwan notes, when religions consume a person's entire life and identity

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.400
psychologically and socially

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.160
leaving can be a difficult and traumatic process.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.960
Religions can implant damaging dehumanising ideas that need to be aired.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.140
Reason On Faith notes that many people do stay silent.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:25.048
Some falsely define themselves as nominal liberal or deficient Muslims

00:09:25.048 --> 00:09:27.140
just to keep the peace.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:32.360
He points out the indignity of living
muzzled inauthentic lives.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.520
That indignity needs to stop.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:42.020
Leaving a religion shouldn't leave people worried about their safety or about being pushed to society's margins.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.700
Disagreement is a normal healthy part of life

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.080
and it's great to see a growing number
of people who've left Islam

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.320
reclaiming their voice and their place in the world.
