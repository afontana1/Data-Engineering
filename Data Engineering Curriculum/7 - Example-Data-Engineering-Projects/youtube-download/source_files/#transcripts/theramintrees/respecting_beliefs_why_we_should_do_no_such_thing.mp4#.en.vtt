00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.840
It's a sentiment that crops up with some
regularity in religious discourse.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.540
Sometimes it's expressed obliquely as a
suggestion that

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.360
we should all respect each other's beliefs.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.500
Other times it's delivered is a demand:

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.480
'I respect your beliefs so 
you should respect mine!'

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.360
But in all cases, my reply is the one
every groom and bride dreads:

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.480
'I don't.'

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.640
With the betrothed, those words
understandably arouse feelings of disorientation,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.080
alienation, even betrayal. But similar
feelings are often evident

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.940
in the reaction of those theists

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.829
whose beliefs I decline to respect.
It might be implied I've broken

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.620
some unspoken social contract 
that demands my reciprocation.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.010
It might be insinuated that
I'm being gratuitously mean.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.180
It's even been put to me that it's my kind
of attitude that causes wars.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.979
But is any of that true? I want to unpack
some of the tangled-up dynamics going on here.

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.430
I'll be exploring four kinds of
emotional blackmail designed to elicit

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.880
undeserved respect from others, and
looking at why declarations of respect from theists

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.939
might be problematic for them. I'll then
be setting out why I don't respect beliefs,

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.670
explaining why religious beliefs — far
from deserving privileged immunity —

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.970
are among the most deserving of scrutiny
and criticism, and addressing

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.760
a last-ditch defence often offered

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.280
that, even if it's false, religion should
be left alone because it performs

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.860
a positive social function.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.210
One of the things the atheist satirist and critic H. L. Mencken got wrong

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.350
was his assertion that we must respect
the other fellow's religion,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.000
but only in the sense and to the extent
that we respect his theory that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.399
his wife is beautiful

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.400
and his children smart. We don't need to
respect the other fellow's religion at all.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.940
Mencken muddies the waters by blurring
together items from very distinct categories.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.850
The theory that your wife is beautiful
is an aesthetic judgment.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.280
Even if you phrase that judgment 
so it sounds like a truth claim —

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.660
ie 'She's beautiful.' — you and I both know — don't we?

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.810
— that this is just shorthand for 'She's
beautiful to me.'

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.580
I have no reason to respond to this
statement. I'm not implicated by in any way.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.370
That only comes if you go a step further
and say, 'She's beautiful isn't she?' —

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.310
in which case, prepare yourself for an
honest answer. Religion, on the other hand,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.260
is in the business of asserting facts
about existence. That does implicate me —

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.599
irretrievably — and it requires my
response. If your reasons for asserting

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.310
these facts stand up to scrutiny,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.190
I have some rethinking to do. If they're
based on unsubstantiated phenomena

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.780
and fallacious arguments, I don't.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.440
Oddly, mirroring the way aesthetic
judgments get phrased like truth claims,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.799
religious truth claims frequently get
phrased like aesthetic judgments.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.290
We often hear it said of some god, 'He's
real to me.' In many cases this is simply

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.299
to forestall any possible challenge,

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.750
translating to: 'He's real to me, no matter
what you say!' But in other cases,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.520
this strangely personalised reality
claim offers an implicit bargain:

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.400
'If you let me make my truth claims
unchallenged, I'll let you make yours.'

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.740
It attempts to establish sympathetic
 interests between both parties.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.540
It says, 'Hey, we can both come out winners
here if we agree to look the other way

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.620
while we both do something very bad

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.290
— epistemologically.' Other folks take a
more psychologically hard-line approach

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.389
invoking a mutual obligation. Here the
message is: 'Look, I'm willing to let you

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.980
make your truth claims unchallenged,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.000
so you should let me make mine!' But
reality can't be bargained with in this way.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.939
The earth isn't a flat disk for you and a
globe for me

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.980
just because we make some wishful pact.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.480
If you're claiming that any gods exist
then you're making a truth claim

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.090
about a reality of which I'm a part — and it's your burden to substantiate it.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.070
Some folks have no such 
squeamishness about proclaiming

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.079
the universal truth of their religion,

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.420
and adopt an openly threatening, violent approach

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.550
to inspire fear among critics —
especially satirical critics.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.630
The need to be able to subject beliefs
to ridicule is not a trivial one.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.130
It's a very important one, 
and becomes more obvious

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.180
the greater the power and influence involved.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.400
When a person or group assumes a
position of power,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.860
their reaction to ridicule can tell us a
lot about their robustness and their humanity.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.060
We might expect to see a range of responses

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.980
from amusement to anger. But when the
responses tip over into violence and persecution,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.480
that's where we see the warning signs
of dictatorships —

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.880
autocracies headed by brittle narcissists, 
prone to self-mythologising.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.129
Ridicule is especially threatening to
these folks.

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.600
Not only does a prick their inflated self-image,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.100
it also reduces their capacity to inspire
adulation and fear among the masses.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.140
No authority is beyond ridicule.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.320
No politician. No priest. No prophet. No parent.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.200
Because that's what theism comes
down to in the end, isn't it.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.910
Our simultaneous longing for and fear of

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.930
the magical, mystical, unquestionable parent.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.940
When we were infants, our parents or 
guardians were our protectors and our punishers

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.080
and this inspired two irreconcilable
responses in us:

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.020
love and fear.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.420
In healthy relationships, where parents'
actions were grounded in love,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.020
we begin to appreciate their
punishments in that context.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.750
We see why our parents snatched our hand away
from the fire; why they berated us

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.000
for walking away with that nice 
grown-up in the park.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.890
Consequently, the fear response is
resolved and recedes.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.010
But in unhealthy relationships, where
parents' actions are grounded in power,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.030
leading to erratic, overblown and
blatantly unjust punishments,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.600
the fear can endure — sometimes at the
expense of love —  and we remain infantilised,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.810
afraid to challenge a corrupt authority.
Which end of the spectrum would you put

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.960
a parent who threatens to burn its
children for declining to worship it?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.640
Of all the authorities we need to be
prepared to question, to resist, to ridicule,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.740
the most urgent cases are
the ones that threaten violence

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.200
when questioned, resisted, or ridiculed.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.800
The fourth manipulative strategy

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.660
attempts to silence challenge by
appealing to guilt. Here, the message is:

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.740
'My beliefs give me comfort — 
can't you just leave them alone?'

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.849
There are times in life when
circumstances run us into the ground.

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.490
Numbly waiting for a phone call about a
child who's been missing for days.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.949
Or dreading lonely evenings after a divorce.

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.589
Or sitting at a loved one's hospital bedside
watching them slip away from us.

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.669
In these situations, we might find
comfort in many things.

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.200
A hug. A chat with a friend.  
A piece of music. A drive to the coast.

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.649
The opportunity to escape for a day,

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:25.559
an hour, even a handful of minutes
 — to lay our burden down

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:30.179
and let in some comfort — can be
invaluable in refilling our depleted reserves,

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.319
and keeping us going. And many of us
would do whatever we could

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.439
to facilitate that comfort for others.
But what if a loved one risked his health

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.469
by diving into relentless unprotected
sex with strangers

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.039
to drown out the pain of divorce?
What if a loved one started handing over

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.919
her savings to a con artist

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.529
to commune with a dead relative? Would we
be so quick to facilitate these comforts?

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.589
What about the knock-on effect on others?

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.060
If parents take comfort in fantasies of an afterlife

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.809
to avoid dealing with death, what will
their children be taught?

00:06:57.809 --> 00:06:59.780
Will they get the chance to face death honestly?

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.809
or will they now be forced to collude
with their parents' denial?

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:06.449
Without afterlife fantasies, would parents be
so quick to deny their children

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.380
life-saving medical treatment on religious grounds?

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.000
What about suicide attackers

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.069
who anticipate a glorious martyr's reward
for their deeds?

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.229
Afterlife fantasies are not harmless or
neutral.

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.079
They're multivalent: susceptible to a wide
variety of applications.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:25.309
The desire for comfort can lead to
destructive and deadly behaviors

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:28.990
as well as states of perpetual denial
which are frequently imposed on others.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.539
Which is why I don't view comfort as
something to be automatically cherished

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:33.800
or facilitated.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.839
And why it's often more humanitarian to
challenge comfort than to enable it.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:41.599
Feelings of fear, obligation, guilt and
sympathy

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:45.469
can help us in some scenarios. Fear can
help us escape dangerous situations.

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:48.599
Obligation can help strengthen
legitimate social contracts.

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:51.519
But when folks try to play on these
feelings to get us to comply with

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.499
unreasonable self-serving demands,

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:58.500
that's emotional blackmail — and we need
to be clear that that's not acceptable behaviour.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.120
It's worth noting that when people tell me
they respect my beliefs,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.250
a little probing often reveals problems
with that statement.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.389
With christians, I have to put it to them
that this professed respect

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:17.139
directly conflicts with their Bible.
First, let's consider the earthly life.

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:20.680
In the Bible's blood-soaked old
testament, Deuteronomy chapter 13

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.169
sets out the christian god Yahweh's
punishment for worshiping other gods:

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:27.940
the sword and the stone.
Though less saturated with sadism,

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.979
the Bible's new testament, which
introduces the christians' messiah, Jesus Christ,

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:36.159
maintains its distaste for
non-christians. In 2 John chapter 1,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.459
verses 9 to 11,

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:41.099
christians are clearly instructed not to
receive non-christians into their houses.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:45.119
Even by greeting them, christians are
apparently taking part in their 'wicked work'.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.230
When we look beyond death to the
christian afterlife,

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.440
the gloves come off completely. If you
don't believe in the messiah,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.649
you're condemned to eternal fiery punishment.
I put it to the christians who say they

00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:57.459
respect the beliefs of non-christians

00:08:57.459 --> 00:09:01.639
that you cannot reconcile your professed
respect with these kinds of Biblical passages.

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.200
Beliefs for which your God prescribes
execution,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.260
social rejection and, ultimately, eternal
torture cannot be respectable.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.520
With muslims, similar problems arise.

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:15.029
To them, I would be considered 'culpably ignorant'

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:17.500
and, therefore, destined for perpetual hell-fire.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.050
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not asking
you to respect my beliefs —

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.329
in a moment, I'll be explaining why
beliefs don't require respect —

00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:27.660
but I encourage you to have a serious
think about these passages.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.300
Because when your religion tells you
that non-members deserve execution,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.280
social rejection and eternal torture,
we're not just talking about disrespecting beliefs.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.380
We're talking about dehumanising people.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.240
Later on, I'll be looking at the evasions some folks offer

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.310
when this begins to hit home.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.900
Every belief that gets introduced into the
public space needs to be open to criticism.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.300
If we take its validity as untouchable,
then we'll be forced to reject

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.280
valid information the conflicts with it.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.960
The need to be able to criticise beliefs
becomes more obvious

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.060
as the reach of those beliefs increases.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.880
The belief that Henry VIII occasionally
 liked to dress up in his wife's clothes

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.930
isn't going to have a huge impact on our
lives.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.300
But the belief that our government is always right

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.410
would have a huge effect on how we 
assess all kinds of information.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.580
Another reason already touched on is
that beliefs shape behaviour.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.820
Group C believes cancer always
results from a guilty conscience,

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.260
and can only be healed by confession
and sincere repentance.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.720
Group D believes cancer
is a cluster of diseases,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.160
prompted by a range of genetic
and environmental triggers.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.000
It's clear to see these beliefs will result
in very distinct patterns of behaviour.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.100
For group C, cancer is a very
straightforward matter.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.540
Patients will be judged as bringing it
on themselves

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.800
and will be urged to confess and repent.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.370
Those who die will be judged insincere.
Knowledge about cancer will not increase,

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.950
nor will survival rates. For group D,
cancer is a complex phenomenon.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.640
Patients will be studied to identify
genetic and environmental triggers

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.210
and, in response to the patterns that
emerge, corresponding treatment plans

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.100
and preventative measures will be
developed.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.060
As studies open up new avenues of
investigation,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.900
knowledge about cancer will increase

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.160
as will survival rates. 'Ah,' you might say,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.470
'But even though group C's belief is
false, it could actually have great

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.820
benefits for society.'

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.930
'If group C believes guilty consciences cause cancer,

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.080
surely,' you might say, 'we'd expect to see
much more moral behavior from its members.'

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.160
'After all, for them, a clear conscience
would mean a cancer-free life.'

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.660
'Isn't that a powerful motivation to treat
each other well? Group D, on the other hand,

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.640
who doesn't see cancer is a moral issue,
has no such incentive.'

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.820
Both groups, you might say,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.410
offer their own advantages — with group D
offering improved survival rates,

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.950
but group C offering substantially
enhanced relationships across society.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.960
But what if we were to discover that, far
from leading to some moral utopia,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.540
group C's belief actively encouraged some of
the most extreme immorality we'd ever come across.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.060
Let's look at a couple of strategies

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.920
that comfortably combine repeated
immorality with a clear conscience.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.620
Strategy one simply acknowledges

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.480
the power of confession and repentance.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.339
According to group C's belief, it
doesn't matter what we do.

00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:04.399
Even if we invite cancer by knowingly
committing immoral acts,

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:08.290
we'll be healed the moment we confess and
repent. Now, there is a small problem here

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.740
in that, if we keep repeating the same
transgressions,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.960
the sincerity of our repentance must be
called into question.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.600
To make the strategy more viable,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.180
we need to make it more difficult to be
moral. One way of doing this is by viewing

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.089
ourselves as substantially more flawed
than we really are —

00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:25.820
picturing ourelves as wretched, weak,
selfish creatures,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.130
powerless to resist all kinds of temptation.
By doing this, we can set up

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.959
the idea of a noble struggle,

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:36.190
in which we're constantly battling to
stay moral, despite overwhelming odds.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.329
This version of the strategy allows us a lot
more latitude.

00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:42.490
Here, we can plausibly repeat the same
transgressions indefinitely,

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.950
while continuing to express contrition.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.450
Strategy two does away with confession and repentance altogether.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:52.640
In this strategy, we simply reframe 
immoral behavior as moral.

00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:55.349
This can easily be achieved with a
phrase familiar to us all:

00:12:55.349 --> 00:12:56.639
'It's for your own good.'

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.089
With these five simple words, vice
becomes virtue.

00:13:00.089 --> 00:13:03.519
Bullying becomes discipline. 
Rape becomes therapy.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.560
Intolerance becomes charity. Hate becomes love.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.720
We can now abuse people without the slightest small twinge.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.360
Any of this sounding familiar?

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.339
Group C's belief about cancer 
doesn't guarantee a better society.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.280
In fact it guarantees a lot of
destructive behaviour.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.120
After all, those who commit 
immoral acts and stay cancer-free

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.480
have proof of their righteousness. It
will also lead to a lot of

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.540
unnecessary soul-searching by folks 
who get cancer despite behaving morally.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.740
They'll be forced to identify

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.519
non-existent transgressions

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:36.690
and, of course, being human, they'll find
them. Or have them found by others.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.290
Cancer doesn't give us moral
understanding.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.279
And neither do holy scriptures that approve
so much blatantly immoral behavior

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:47.440
that it's possible to justify acts across
the entire moral-immoral spectrum,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.280
to the extreme of genocide.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.100
A moral compass with two norths
is no compass at all.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.120
Moral systems need to be open systems
because our moral awareness advances

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.760
with the discovery of new information.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.000
For example, the morality of vivisection,

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.880
performed by anatomists such as Galen
and Versalius, and justified by philosophers

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.920
such as Descartes,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.150
was called into question when animals,
previously viewed as insensible machines,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.330
were instead seen to be capable of
experiencing pain.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.360
Scriptures like the Bible and Qur'an are not open systems.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.110
They don't allow for new insights
 which change the moral landscape.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.670
Instead, they present fixed moral
pronouncements,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.620
based on moral conjecture from centuries ago,

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.830
preserving all the moral 
ignorance of those times.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.100
To increase the frequency of moral behaviour  
throughout the world requires that we think;

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.800
that we question and reason and discuss;
that we gather good information

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.560
about the needs, the benefits  
and the harms involved in a given situation;

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.620
and that we're willing to 
review our assessments

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.500
as new, relevant information emerges.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.620
Most important of all, it requires that we
reject ideologies which obstruct

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.040
all of these processes by attempting to
anchor us

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.240
in an ignorant past we've long outgrown,

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.260
and by demanding privileged immunity
from criticism.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.200
Some theists express confusion about
why atheists have a problem with the idea of hell

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.480
when we don't even believe it exists.
To those theists, I ask a simple question:

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.610
'Do I deserve eternal torture?' Those who
answer 'Yes' make my point for me.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.130
Their belief has dehumanised me to the
point that they can tell me —

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:24.630
without shame — that they support a system
that consigns me to unending suffering.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.670
Not for committing some genocidal
atrocity. Not for harming a single person.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.070
But for the crime but not believing in
something for which I had no evidence.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.110
Those who evade my question also
illustrate my point.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.880
The first of two common evasions is: 
'It's not up to me.'

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.180
This is disingenuous redundancy. Folks
who respond this way know full well

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.029
that's not the question I'm asking.

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:48.720
But I'll walk them through the long version
anyway: 'I'm a non-believer.'

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.500
'According to your god, non-believers
deserve eternal torture.'

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.180
'Do you agree with your god that I
deserve eternal torture?'

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.550
More often than not, I'll get exactly the
same politician's response.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.360
These folks are stuck between defending
the indefensible — hell —

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.160
and questioning the unquestionable —
their god.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.320
And it's not always realistic to expect
a swift resolution to that kind of

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.420
internal conflict.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.160
But for me, it's a promising sign that
there is at least some internal conflict.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.100
It shows me there's some appropriate
discomfort about this vile concept.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.230
It also means they haven't yet
rationalised the problem of hell.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.329
They haven't invested in a fallacious
justification. This leaves room to hope

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:29.829
that their internal conflict will inspire
further private reflection.

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:33.279
The other common evasion is: 
'You send yourself to hell.'

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:35.239
This is a very different kind of evasion.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.459
Here, the problem the hell has been rationalised,

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:41.439
removing responsibility from the god in
question and placing it on the non-believer.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.180
This is known as blaming the victim and
it's a well-known distancing manoeuvre

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.199
employed by abusers and their conspirers.
After they've beaten their spouses,

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:53.039
instigators of domestic violence deny
responsibility for their actions by complaining:

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.860
'Look what you made me do!'

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.720
In the novel 'Sophie's Choice'

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.140
The eponymous character, a Holocaust
survivor, is forced by a sadistic doctor

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.960
at Auschwitz to decide the fate
of her two children.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.340
One will be gassed. 
The other will be allowed to live.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.560
When she fails to choose, she's told
they'll both be gassed.

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.390
In a moment of panic, Sophie chooses

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.180
and is tormented by guilt for the rest for her days.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.080
But she's utterly blameless. The doctor
was entirely responsible,

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.640
forcing her into a grotesque position.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.460
Non-believers don't send themselves to eternal torture.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.500
That's the rationalisation of the sadist.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.460
All of these responses show why atheists have a problem with hell

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.200
even though we don't believe it exists.
It's because it dehumanises us.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.850
One of the first things done to groups
who are targeted for discrimination

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:43.140
is that their human status is stripped of
them. They might be described explicitly

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.020
as subhuman, or as animals or insects.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.760
Rats. Monkeys. Cockroaches.
If you view people as cockroaches,

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.060
how are you likely to treat them? What about
when you downgrade people to kindling?

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.920
The day Christopher Hitchens died,
I remember being sent

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.060
a link to a freshly uploaded video

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.760
gleefully depicting him burning in hell
— an image relished by many

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.540
and reflected in a range a very public expressions,

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.240
from the blogs of christian zealots

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.070
to the joyful chants of muslims protesting outside

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:16.880
the 2012 atheist convention in Melbourne
— alternating his name with 'Ayaan Hirsi Ali'.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.340
This ghoulish disposition was embraced as a lifestyle

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.200
by the Westboro Baptist Church

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.690
who plumbed new depths of tastelessness
by picketing the funerals

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.860
of various groups they considered hellbound,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:32.160
and any perceived sympathisers. In 2015,
they were reportedly thwarted in their attempt

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.320
to obstruct actor Leonard Nimoy's funeral 
when they couldn't find its location.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.560
The church's leader Fred Phelps openly
revelled in the hate his actions provoked,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.340
interpreting it as evidence of his
righteousness, on the basis that

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.740
the Biblical prophets were also hated.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.920
When you reduce people to hell-fodder,
it's remarkable how low you can go.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.390
Which is why it's especially important to
attack beliefs that dehumanise.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.630
My impression is that most theists have a
great discomfort about the whole

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.760
'sending non-believers to hell' concept.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.300
Many Christians I've spoken to flat-out
deny the existence of hell,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.500
asserting that their god simply wouldn't
allow such an abomination.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.530
Others have cheerfully consoled me with
their view that non-believers just die.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:14.030
That's it. No eternal punishment. I'm not
one to look a gift horse in the mouth,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.370
but I do have to ask: where are 
they getting this information?

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.970
Certainly not from Matthew chapter 25
which refers explicitly to eternal punishment.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.650
Sometimes I'm genuinely touched by the
obvious positive intentions of theists

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.600
who distort their ideology in all kinds of ways

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.760
in order to reach out their hands in
brotherhood and sisterhood.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.750
Some christians go as far as declaring
that a belief in their god is non-essential —

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.070
all that matters is how we treat each other.
But we have to acknowledge that

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.059
this is exactly the kind of thinking that got
us into this hellish mess in the first place:

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:45.959
making up whatever we want to believe.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.480
It's sometimes asserted that religions like  
christianity have withstood the test of time.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.650
They haven't. They've cheated the test of
time, employing various dishonest tactics

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.740
such as the indoctrination of children

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.880
who've not yet developed their critical faculties.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.960
But a dishonest tactic that spans both young and old,

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.900
members and non-members, is the
consistent attempt to marginalise

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.240
and silence critics. We need to be able
to subject all beliefs to criticism

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.429
and, as I've shown, that need 
only becomes more obvious

00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:16.249
the greater the knock-on impact a
belief has on other ideas;

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:18.559
the greater the power and influence involved;

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:22.559
the more fervently criticism is discouraged
 — particularly by violent means;

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:25.179
and the more a belief has a
dehumanising effect,

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.280
facilitating remorseless abuse.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.970
Doesn't get much plainer. We're talking
about the major world religions.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.070
The resentments harboured against 
me and others like me,

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.080
who decline to respect religious
beliefs, are unfounded.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.210
I've broken no contract. I give no
special regard to your beliefs,

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.450
but I ask no special regard for mine.
Beliefs stand or fall on their own merits.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.030
I'm not being mean —
criticising unjustified beliefs is important

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.360
because they can lead to real problems.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.950
If some folks make the mistake

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.080
of investing their core identity
in an unjustified belief

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.940
so that when it gets criticised, 
they feel criticised,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.179
then it's up to them to learn from that mistake —

00:21:02.179 --> 00:21:04.459
not up to everyone else to pay for it.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.080
And it's not my attitude the causes wars.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.770
Wars are caused by beliefs like supremacism

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.120
— the idea that one group is
intrinsically superior to all others.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.440
Supremacism can be based on many things.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:22.220
Gender. The colour of skin.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.929
The scriptures of major world religions

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:28.249
like christianity and islam are about
as supremacist as it's possible to be,

00:21:28.249 --> 00:21:31.269
damning all non-members to eternal torture.

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:35.620
No earthly supremacist could hope
to achieve sadism on such a scale.

00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:39.559
For centuries, religious supremacism
has inspired a range of conflict

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:44.059
from everyday acts of social discrimination
to colonialism to genocide.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.820
Beliefs like these are what cause wars.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.650
And I hope it's now clear

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.750
why I decline to respect them.
