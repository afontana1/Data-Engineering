00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:47.699
‘Save’. Verb.

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:51.600
‘to deliver someone from danger or difficulty’.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.569
The urge to save people might sound

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:57.010
— by definition — like an unqualified
social good.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.000
Of course in countless cases, the impulse
to assist individuals

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.109
we perceive to be in some kind of trouble

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.440
is a resoundingly positive one.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.620
But, being human, that impulse can misfire.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.970
Maisy spots a man drowning.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.950
She dives in and drags him ashore, kicking
and thrashing.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.773
He then tells her he wasn’t drowning but waving.

00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:22.157
Awkward.

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:25.329
As onlookers to this incident, we might view it

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.210
as a well-intentioned mistake and see the
funny side.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.870
But then it happens with another swimmer.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.610
And another.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.690
And another.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.759
Each time the swimmer tells Maisy her intervention
wasn’t needed.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.110
But Maisy remains convinced that without her
they would’ve perished.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.970
She dismisses their protests as face-saving
delusions.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.360
And, swallowing the increasingly salty martyrdom
she feels at their ingratitude

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.450
Maisy continues her redundant rescue campaign.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.759
It’s as if she’s on a pre-programmed mission

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.359
unable to register conflicting new intel and
revise her course of action.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.500
The compulsion to rescue others is commonly
known as a ‘saviour complex’.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.720
The word ‘complex’ refers to a pervasive
pattern of feelings, beliefs, perceptions, impulses

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.410
all based on a specific issue.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.230
With guilt complexes, this pattern centres
around notions of personal blame.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.250
With superiority complexes, the pattern reinforces
ideas about personal status and value.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.060
This pattern becomes the lens through which
we view ourselves.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.500
Its distorted nature clouds our ability to
process feedback from the environment.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.560
When reality conflicts with this lens, we
bend and break reality to fit

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.360
inventing fallacious denials and rationalisations
to erase facts and destroy context.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.310
This makes the complex maladaptive

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.330
—&nbsp;ie it doesn’t adapt adequately or appropriately
to the situation.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.650
Which is why, despite consistent evidence
to the contrary

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.420
individuals like Maisy manage to maintain
their heroic self-images.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.750
As I’ll be exploring later with some real-life examples

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.700
there’s no single path to a saviour complex.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.049
Like comic book superheroes
people with saviour complexes

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.800
are an eclectic group with a vast variety
of origin stories.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.849
The compulsions that drive saviour behaviour
can take hold in childhood

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.569
or in adulthood in response to transformative
life experiences

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.159
from overcoming a major illness to witnessing
a grave injustice

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.450
to encountering an influential new social group.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.810
Saviour compulsions could be rooted

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.650
in mainly individual or ideological factors
—&nbsp;or a combination.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.450
Their targets could range from loved ones
to the whole of humanity.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.330
But a common thread among all these saviours
is a persistent failure

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.810
to look closely at the people they plan to save

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.830
—&nbsp;and see them for who they are.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.230
One of the habits we slip into when we develop

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.940
maladaptive saviour tendencies is infantilising people.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.410
We view them as less capable and aware than
they are.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.820
And, as we would with children

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.730
we start to impose our help on them without
invitation or consultation.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:35.410
For the target, our unsolicited interventions
can feel awkward, confusing and alienating.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.979
In some cases, our ‘help’ might get so
smothering and invasive

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.270
that it creates hefty additional obstacles
for targets to overcome.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.699
Often, there wasn’t even a problem to fix
in the first place.

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.750
We just invented it to satisfy our insatiable
urge to help.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.949
Overcoming these maladaptive saviour compulsions
is possible

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.720
if we’re willing to engage in some serious
self-reflection.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.440
Unfortunately, we sometimes have to reach
crisis point

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.430
before we take even a sidelong glimpse at
ourselves.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.720
We have to drive ourselves to exhaustion.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.450
Relationships and careers have to start crumbling
and collapsing.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.729
Even when things are falling apart, it can
be unthinkably tough to face the truth

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.819
that for all the years we’ve been donning
our gaudy superhero costumes

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.440
believing we were making a real difference

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.080
all we were actually doing was participating
in an addictive form

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.207
of bogus social interaction known as drama.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.979
We are a complex, multi-faceted species

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.600
with a staggering potential for spontaneity,
adaptability and creativity.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.630
Which is handy in view of our unfathomable
individual variation.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.380
Each of us is born with our own unique combination

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.740
of physical and psychological capacities and
thrust with no road map

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.960
into our own distinctive social, cultural
and environmental conditions.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.230
In confronting the obstacles of our particular
roll-of-the-dice existence

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.759
—&nbsp;from minor irritations to major disasters —

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:20.199
we each have at our disposal a brain bursting
with critical analytical potential.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.110
But often, instead of using these formidable faculties

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.380
to figure out real practical solutions to
our problems

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.440
we get sidetracked into an empty parody of
problem-solving called drama.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.380
Drama allows us to pretend we’re tackling
real issues

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.950
when we’re actually just indulging in self-affirming
mind games.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.639
Drama brings out the worst in us

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:48.350
opening the doors to our most controlling,
coercive, dehumanising behaviour.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.759
When we develop powerful saviour tendencies

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:56.539
we seem drawn to the artificial glow of drama
like moths to a porch light.

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:59.220
Steadfast in the belief we’re fighting the
good fight

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.310
we can drift into the most disturbing extremes
without a moral twinge.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.160
I use the word drama in the social-psychological
sense

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.670
although there are parallels with the theatrical sense.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.879
In theatrical drama, scenes that appear spontaneous
are in fact predefined.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:23.290
What seem like authentic interactions are
built on illusion and misdirection.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.080
In social-psychological drama

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.770
individuals also deliver performances based
on deceptive predefined roles.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.530
The actors on this dramatic stage typically
fall into one of three interconnected positions.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:42.720
Together these form what psychologist Steven
Karpman dubbed the ‘drama triangle’.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.199
First there’s the victim.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:48.050
In this dramatic role, we play the part of
a powerless injured party.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.970
We become passive and self-pitying and, like
children

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.710
we look to other people to rescue us.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.040
Confusingly, if we’re offered real practical
solutions

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.830
we’ll often find ways to avoid, reject or
sabotage them.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.510
Real solutions generally involve taking adult
responsibility for our own welfare

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.889
— and drama-based victimhood is rooted in
the rejection of responsibility.

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:17.250
We’re invested in the idea that our feelings,
our experiences,

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.800
our lives are determined by other people.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.479
Next we have the persecutor, who looks for
victims to harass, attack and oppress.

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:31.699
In this dramatic role, we become self-righteous
and dictatorial.

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:35.459
We might portray ourselves as purveyors of
truth and justice.

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:38.889
But we disregard the mechanisms that underpin
these principles

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:45.630
— like the burden of proof, due process,
the presumption of innocence.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:51.380
Instead we play judge, jury and jailer in
our own kangaroo courts.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.450
Like victims, we also dodge personal responsibility.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.730
If our own flaws and shortcomings are pointed out

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.670
we’ll find ways to excuse, minimise or deny them.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.029
Someone else is always to blame.

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:09.730
Lastly we come to the rescuer, who looks for
victims to save.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.529
In this role, we take on too much responsibility

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:15.470
by assuming the burden of other people’s
problems.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.220
On the surface, we might appear self-sacrificing.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.390
It can seem — to others and ourselves —

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.690
like we’re constantly putting our own needs
behind the needs of others.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.080
In fact, our most dominant need is firmly
stage front.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.410
As rescuers, our chief goal isn’t to help others.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.310
It’s to extract validation from them.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:42.340
Here we have the central self-deception of
this dramatic role.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.770
Playing the rescuer is primarily about taking,
not giving.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:52.130
This helps to explain why targets often come
away from us feeling so drained.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:57.440
The specific type of validation we look for
as rescuers can vary hugely.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:04.400
We might be after attention, admiration, control,
social acceptance.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.839
If we have problems with guilt or shame

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:09.200
we might play the rescuer to gain self-worth.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.660
Our need for validation can also vary in intensity.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.090
The more intense it gets, the less room we
have for competing needs

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.410
— other people’s or our own —

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:26.280
and the more misguided and reckless our rescue
attempts can become.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.160
So we have three dramatic roles, all based
in delusion and contradiction

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.040
each focused on seeking affirmation for its
particular fantasy.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.580
It’s no surprise that none of them do anything
to help us work towards solutions.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.839
Instead they just reinforce existing problems
— and generate new ones.

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:49.510
When we think of saviour complexes

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.720
we might reasonably equate them with the rescuer
position.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.402
In fact saviours can occupy any of the dramatic roles.

00:10:57.402 --> 00:10:59.139
One of the things that makes drama

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:02.339
such a slippery, tangled-up form of social
interaction

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:05.126
is that players can switch positions.

00:11:05.126 --> 00:11:07.366
Rescuers can become victims.

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:10.030
Victims can become persecutors.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.353
And so on.

00:11:11.353 --> 00:11:15.500
These role shifts can occur suddenly in response
to a single incident

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.720
that disrupts our perception of ourselves
in relation to others.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.150
Or they can be gradual, in response to an
accumulation of experiences.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.520
An example of these dramatic shifts is illustrated

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.350
in the story of someone I’ll call Gordon.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.120
Gordon has a radioactive saviour streak.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.100
He’s recruited by an ideological group that
seems to share his outlook.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.360
In rescuer mode, Gordon approaches
other individuals to recruit.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.019
But things don’t go well.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:50.070
Some of his targets laugh at his ideas.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.639
Some angrily condemn them as corrupt and degrading.

00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:59.139
Some targets engage in polite discourse and
offer thoughtful criticisms.

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:03.910
The majority simply isn’t interested.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.529
Something Gordon later came to appreciate

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:08.790
was that people generally have their own concerns
to deal with

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.910
and don’t have time for ideological sales
pitches from strangers.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:20.199
But at the time, all these widely diverging
reactions just blur into one big rejection.

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:24.960
For Gordon, these encounters aren’t about
an exchange of ideas.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.779
They’re geared towards one outcome: recruitment.

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:32.829
And all he takes away is that people wouldn’t
listen to him.

00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:36.029
He slips into a self-pitying victim position.

00:12:36.029 --> 00:12:39.899
Can’t they see he’s trying to help them?

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:41.889
From his self-absorbed viewpoint

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:46.240
people seem deliberately, maliciously obstructive.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.750
As his ideas continue to get rebuffed

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.350
his despair hardens into contempt.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.899
Gradually, he drifts into the persecutor position.

00:12:55.899 --> 00:12:59.199
In his mind, if you’re not onboard with
the group’s ideas

00:12:59.199 --> 00:13:02.540
you’re an obstacle to salvation.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.500
He starts insulting anyone who isn’t instantly
receptive to his ideas.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.680
When people react with predictable hostility

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.199
Gordon takes their animosity as proof of their
wicked nature.

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:19.389
His negativity has become self-fulfilling.

00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:22.149
He actively creates enemies in the world

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:24.750
then complains the world is full of enemies.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.279
If you’d met him at this point

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:30.810
there would’ve been no hint of his idealistic
beginnings.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.980
He’d become an aggressive force for conflict
and division.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.980
We might conclude that Gordon had now lost
his saviour tendencies.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.570
In fact, Gordon reflected that it was during
this period

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.730
that he felt more heroic than ever.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.730
He was no longer fighting some abstract philosophy.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.160
He was in the trenches

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.990
pushing back against living breathing adversaries.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.940
As Gordon’s story illustrates

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.290
once we step onto the dramatic stage

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.720
we can’t always tell where we’ll end up.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.540
Drama is about the pursuit of emotional validation

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.910
unconstrained by reality.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.860
Without facts or context to guide us

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.060
it’s easy to lose our bearings.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.699
What feel initially like noble intentions

00:14:20.699 --> 00:14:23.200
can steer us into monstrous actions.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.970
How do we step off this seductive stage?

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.630
If we can bring our focus back to reality

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.380
we might be able to make the shift

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.740
from a drama-prone saviour to a drama-free
supporter.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.160
A crucial part of that shift is listening.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.269
Like many saviours, Gordon recalled that he
always tended

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:46.820
to skim the surface of what people said to him

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.970
looking for potential problems.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.540
As a result of not listening

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.470
he’d end up bending himself all out of shape

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.130
intervening in situations he’d completely
misunderstood.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:03.170
A friend might be grumbling about a rough
day at work.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.350
Suddenly Gordon would be telling him to retrain
for another job

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.440
and spewing a stream of career ideas.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.170
Looking back on moments like these

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.000
Gordon realised how overbearing his behaviour
used to be.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.500
He could see now that all his friend wanted

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.880
was a bit of tea and sympathy.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.800
Drama feeds on misinterpretation.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.079
By helping to avoid misinterpretation

00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:30.740
listening is a great preventative measure
against drama.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:36.610
Being a supporter means encouraging people’s
own efforts to help themselves.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.120
When we constantly step in and take over

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.600
we push people towards&nbsp;dependence, passivity,
unaccountability.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.899
In other words, a victim position.

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:49.370
To promote the opposite qualities

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.750
—&nbsp;of self-reliance, proactivity and responsibility —

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.300
we have to stand back and let people work
through

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.590
their own problems with minimal intervention.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.730
Supporters acknowledge their own needs.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.120
Of course there’ll be moments in life

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.220
when we put other people’s needs first

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.660
— sometimes to the extreme detriment of
our own.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:16.389
But these moments are meant to be the exception,
not the rule.

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:20.649
Constantly neglecting ourselves is an unsustainable
living strategy.

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:23.160
And an irresponsible one.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.920
If our habitual self-neglect leads to severe problems

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.610
like health issues or financial troubles

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:34.270
we can end up becoming a significant burden
on others.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.589
Putting our own needs first doesn’t mean
impinging on other people’s needs.

00:16:38.589 --> 00:16:42.610
In fact, putting our own needs first leaves
us better equipped

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.709
for the times when other people really do
need us.

00:16:46.709 --> 00:16:51.940
Leading on from that, supporters pursue their
own full life.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.829
Saviours often have pretty empty lives.

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:57.880
Is the emptiness a result of their constant heroics?

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.779
Or do the heroics act as a distraction from
a pre-existing emptiness?

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:06.059
Either way, investing in our own lives

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:10.610
helps prevent us from intruding in the lives
of others.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:14.289
For individuals who manage to hang up their cape

00:17:14.289 --> 00:17:16.549
and let go of their saviour tendencies

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:20.089
there’s sometimes a period of acute embarrassment

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.910
when they reflect on their previous pseudo-heroic
behaviour.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.820
I want to look at some real-life cases of people

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.690
who weathered that embarrassment

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.818
and began a new anti-drama life.

00:17:37.003 --> 00:17:40.860
I met the individual I’ll call ‘Tyrone’
at university

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.400
during my psychology degree.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.280
We were assigned to the same tutorial group.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.940
These were&nbsp;smalls group of five or six students

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.240
who met every week, supervised by a course leader

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.460
to discuss course material and explore individual
areas of interest.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.630
In our group, discussions were constantly
derailed by Tyrone.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.880
I’ve often forgotten how disruptive he was

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.620
because after the first year he transformed
into a different person

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:14.780
—&nbsp;positive, reflective, a team player and
a real giggler.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.760
It’s strange —&nbsp;and sad — to remember
the closed-off individual

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:25.049
we met in year one who exuded perpetual frustration.

00:18:25.049 --> 00:18:26.080
During that first year

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.940
Tyrone styled himself as a champion social educator

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.010
enlightening the ignorant masses.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.419
From our very first tutorial session

00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:40.870
he was scrutinising everyone’s words for
possible prejudicial content.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.600
Someone would be speaking and he’d suddenly
lurch forward

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.750
and shout ‘Hold on!’ and accuse the speaker
of some social bias.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.090
These accusations would invariably prove to
be unfounded.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:57.260
His standard charge was: ‘That’s a stereotype!’

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.730
One of countless examples was when a group
member I’ll call Chaz

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:05.340
was speaking about how caring her mother was.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.410
Tyrone cried ‘Stereotype!’ and declared that Chaz

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:12.789
was perpetuating the idea that women have
to be nurturing.

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:17.020
Furthermore — by implication — she was
perpetuating the idea

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.010
that men didn’t have to be nurturing.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.130
This was his typical tactic.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.880
He would fallaciously extrapolate gigantic
through-lines

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.000
from a single innocent instance.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.419
This allowed him to invent a continual stream
of transgressions

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:34.580
to protest against.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.809
Sometimes, after shouting ‘Hold on!’

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:41.200
Tyrone would pause for a moment then back down.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.170
He’d explain that he thought the speaker
was about to say something prejudiced.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.570
He’d then allow the speaker to continue.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.620
Evidently he had constant negative expectations
of bias from us.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.020
His consistent failure to find those biases

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.200
did nothing to persuade him of their nonexistence.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.850
For Tyrone, absence of evidence was evidence
of hidden presence.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.970
Tyrone’s behaviour was so outlandish that
after a few weeks

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.410
a member of the group I’ll call Yani suggested
it must be

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.900
some kind of psychology experiment.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.210
He said Tyrone had to be a plant.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.980
No one behaved like this in real life.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:26.549
A sheepish smile on Tyrone’s face was all
the confirmation the group needed.

00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:31.240
People laughed and told him what a convincing
jerk he’d been.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.600
Eventually, the tutor, Bob, gingerly intervened

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.350
and said it wasn’t an experiment.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.130
Tyrone was for real.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:45.409
Let’s just say the rest of that session
was a little tense.

00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:47.210
And it was also a turning point.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:53.290
Up until then, Tyrone had monopolised the
group’s attention very successfully.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.050
After that, there was a steep decline in patience.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.460
Group members stopped enabling his interruptions.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.669
We’d carry on speaking.

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:03.900
It didn’t stop his accusations.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.990
But he did learn to wait his turn.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.650
Tyrone’s relentless misinterpretations of
our words

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.090
were a constant invitation to conflict and drama.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.570
For the most part, group members brushed his
comments off.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.990
The predominant feeling towards him
was secondhand embarrassment.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.549
He was like a child in a newspaper cape

00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:29.059
waiting to be told what a brave hero he was.

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:36.060
But one member — a Scottish nurse I’ll
call June —&nbsp;was more direct.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.700
One week, June was recounting a family event
up in Glasgow.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.570
When she mentioned that she’d had to order cabs

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.370
for several family members who were too drunk
to drive

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:50.429
Tyrone sailed into action, crying ‘Stereotype!’

00:21:50.429 --> 00:21:52.900
and told her she was perpetuating the idea

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.119
that all Scottish people were alcoholics.

00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:59.210
June joked that most of her relatives were
alcoholics.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.270
But Tyrone wouldn’t let it lie.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.020
He started pseudo-psychoanalysing her.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.100
He suggested that she’d heard these Scottish
stereotypes

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.289
so many times, she’d absorbed them

00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:13.870
— and developed some kind of self-loathing.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:18.279
He used words like ‘unconscious’ and ‘internalised’

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:22.640
and spoke with breathtaking condescension.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.820
Eventually June snapped and bluntly told him
where to go.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.620
That moment would set the tone for their entire
relationship.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.080
Whenever he tried to target her

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.990
she’d swiftly shut him down with some colourful
response.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.070
For a time, he tried to play the wounded party.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.260
At one point he called on Bob to tell June

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.870
she couldn’t speak to him that way

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.990
— in effect, inviting Bob to play the rescuer.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.659
Bob declined.

00:22:52.659 --> 00:22:54.900
Instead he imparted some friendly advice:

00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.360
‘If you don’t want to get stung, don’t
poke the beehive.’

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.559
It was a simple, practical solution.

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:06.350
And Tyrone completely ignored it.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.779
For the rest of the year, he continued to
poke the beehive

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:13.810
and flip-flop between persecutor and victim.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.750
At the time, we found his masochism baffling.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.750
Why choose to keep getting stung?

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:25.120
But we were applying rationality to drama.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.870
For masochism to persist, there has to be
some pay-off.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.240
For Tyrone, these stings gave him a sense
of heroic martyrdom.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.330
He was being attacked for his principles.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.850
During that first year, the one time Tyrone
showed genuine humility

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:46.370
was when one of his grandstanding rescue attempts
blew up in his face.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.940
We were all sharing memories of our primary schools.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.070
Chaz commented that it was weird having to sing

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.800
Christian hymns in the morning assemblies.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.460
Tyrone flew to her aid, declaring her school
to be racist.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.730
Chaz disagreed.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.370
But Tyrone persisted.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.370
He said with her being Indian, they should’ve
been more sensitive

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:13.020
—&nbsp;she might’ve been a Hindu or a Sikh
or a Buddhist.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.830
Chaz laughed and said ‘I’m not Indian.’

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:22.580
Tyrone’s face turned the colour of a London bus.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.980
Having spewed non-stop false allegations of
ignorance against everyone else

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:32.360
he was now caught in a very public moment
of genuine ignorance.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.490
After pausing to let Tyrone respond

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.520
—&nbsp;an opportunity he declined —

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.809
Chaz moved on, without comment&nbsp;or drama

00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:45.310
picking up where she’d left off before his
interjection.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.740
Tyrone was mute for the rest of the session

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.250
and barely spoke for the next few weeks.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:56.400
There was nothing showy or dramatic about
his silence.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:02.190
For the first time he seemed
genuinely uncomfortable with attention.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.909
Although the lure of drama gradually took
hold again

00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:07.830
and the accusations started creeping back

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.320
it was a welcome glimpse of authenticity

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:16.630
— one that would later expand beyond anyone’s
expectations.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:21.169
In the second year, Tyrone returned to the
group a changed man.

00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:24.559
The old air of restless frustration was gone.

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:28.250
He was open, relaxed and engaged.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.080
He listened without prejudice.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.480
And he revealed the most amazing
Michael Fassbender smile

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.830
— a smile that would become my abiding image
of him

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.010
clouding out that rocky first year.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.220
Some weeks into the term, he told me that,
over the summer

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.970
he’d gotten into a relationship.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.040
One weekend, his girlfriend had some friends
around.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.809
To her mortification, Tyrone donned his social
educator mask

00:25:56.809 --> 00:26:00.300
and pulled them to pieces.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.429
After they left she delivered some devastating
home truths.

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:09.530
She said Tyrone pretended to be this amazing,
sensitive, compassionate person.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.700
But actually he treated people like trash.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.930
He looked for the meanest possible interpretation
of people’s words

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.789
just to make himself look good.

00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:24.620
She said he was a hypocrite and a fraud.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.450
It hit him where he lived.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.620
He was a hypocrite

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.040
—&nbsp;especially in the old sense of the word.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.220
An actor, playing a role.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.299
He wanted to look cool, to be admired.

00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:40.210
At school he’d got some positive attention

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.960
from students and teachers for speaking out
against stereotypes.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.520
It became his thing.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.610
Sadly it went to a dark place.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:56.290
It became all about getting admiration, not
tackling real prejudice.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.200
He became a social vampire.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.529
People became things to feed on.

00:27:01.529 --> 00:27:05.429
Tyrone’s girlfriend was the first person
in a long time

00:27:05.429 --> 00:27:08.100
whose feelings he really cared about.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.149
She meant the world to him.

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:15.450
And her rebuke was the kick he’d needed
to sort himself out.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.270
As the second year progressed

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:22.340
the group dived deep into subjects like prejudice
and discrimination.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.429
Some of us shared some related real-life experiences

00:27:25.429 --> 00:27:29.970
of being shunned and abused by families and
communities.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.370
Tyrone said it was an eye-opener.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.110
He’d had no idea what we’d been through.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.260
He cringed at how he had presumed to educate us

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.549
about the nature of prejudice and all its
depth and subtleties

00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:46.510
when all the time, we’d live it.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.950
We just didn’t feel the need to constantly
bring it up

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.299
when it had no relevance.

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:55.160
Tyrone privately apologised to each member
of the group

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.950
for his previous behaviour.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:02.299
But one member —&nbsp;June — always kept her
distance.

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:05.500
Tyrone lamented that he really blew it with her.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.610
But he said it was a useful reminder

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.690
that, in life, you can’t always mend what
you break.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:17.610
Sometimes, when I get cynical about people’s
ability to change

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.785
I remember Tyrone’s transformation.

00:28:20.785 --> 00:28:23.722
And his incredible smile.

00:28:30.364 --> 00:28:33.659
I want to end with the stories of two individual
clients

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:36.559
with saviour complexes who both came to therapy

00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:38.880
in a state of collapsed victimhood.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.309
Dimmy was a personal trainer who’d lost
a number of long-term clients

00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:46.690
he said he’d gone out of his way to help.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.549
Marion had been volunteering on the phones
at a helpline charity for some years

00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:54.880
until a few days ago when she said she’d
been forced out.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.140
They both portrayed themselves as big-hearted
fools in a heartless world.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:05.000
But their casual disregard for personal boundaries
hinted at a different picture.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.840
Dimmy would quiz me intrusively about my health
and fitness

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.580
— and give unsolicited tips on everything

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.700
from specific exercises to food to sleeping
patterns.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.690
He’d often follow up later, wanting to know
if I’d taken his advice.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:25.220
When he didn’t get an affirmative answer,&nbsp;he
was visibly irked.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.649
Marion was a habitual space invader

00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:32.799
constantly touching me, sometimes in very
intimate areas.

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:37.460
When I withdrew from her touch, she’d often
try to reestablish it.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.140
She described herself as an ‘obligate empath’.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.901
She explained this meant she couldn’t help

00:29:42.901 --> 00:29:46.250
picking up other people’s thoughts and feelings.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.760
As she recounted her experiences volunteering
at the helpline

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.779
she would repeatedly preempt my reactions.

00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:56.330
‘Ah! Now you’re thinking X.’

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.860
‘Ah!&nbsp;Now you’re thinking Y.’

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.159
Her guesses were consistently wrong

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:06.860
and she made no attempt to verify them with me.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:11.030
Dimmy and Marion had both become so absorbed
in their own fantasy image

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.659
they’d lost sight of how they came across
to others.

00:30:14.659 --> 00:30:18.309
Gently challenging their self-perceptions
with empathy exercises

00:30:18.309 --> 00:30:21.769
helped to reboot their social awareness.

00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:23.340
Slowly they began to see

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.179
how their superhero costumes looked from the
outside.

00:30:28.179 --> 00:30:30.400
When clients start to realise their own behaviour

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.640
might be the principal source of their problems

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.850
there’s often a sequence of specific responses.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.240
They defend their actions, then regret them

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.789
then understand them

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:46.190
and finally make peace with them.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.510
This sequence isn’t set in stone.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.649
A client might become stuck in one stage for
a while

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:55.399
or flip back and forward between stages.

00:30:55.399 --> 00:30:56.399
In the defend stage

00:30:56.399 --> 00:31:00.039
we’re not ready to see the negative impact
of our behaviour.

00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:03.350
We move into regret as reality sinks in.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:09.980
Our feelings of regret might range from mild
to intensely painful.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.059
For a time we might obsess over a particular
incident

00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:16.340
or feel overwhelmed by multiple incidents.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:20.419
That can start to shift when we begin to understand
our behaviour

00:31:20.419 --> 00:31:24.160
—&nbsp;to see where it came from; what prompted it;

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.090
what needs we were trying to serve.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.970
Finally, in the peace-making stage

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:35.080
our feelings about the past resolve and subside.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.940
As Dimmy and Marion moved through these stages

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.240
their true stories unfolded.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.610
Marion had a turbulent early life

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.950
moving from place to place because of her
parents’ work.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:52.059
She learned to make friends fast by being useful.

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:53.409
Helpful.

00:31:53.409 --> 00:31:55.780
It became her identity.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.529
She was the one people turned to with their
problems.

00:31:59.529 --> 00:32:02.700
In adult life, she began to think about a
career in counselling

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:08.110
and decided to test the water by volunteering
at a helpline charity.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.659
She found it deeply rewarding.

00:32:10.659 --> 00:32:13.340
But the lines began to blur.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.429
Marion had no ‘off’ switch.

00:32:15.429 --> 00:32:18.519
She’d lose herself in the stories of her callers

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:21.420
who played incessantly on her mind.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.360
She was soon juggling multiple weekly shifts

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.030
prompting jokes that she lived at the call
centre.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:31.669
But for Marion it was becoming a substitute home.

00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:34.460
She even bought a stack of mugs with hearts
printed on them

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.820
to replace all the old ones in the kitchen.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.269
Boundaries with colleagues also began to dissolve.

00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:44.230
Marion styled herself as an old mother hen

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.440
dispensing relentless guidance.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.320
Casual conversations became advice clinics.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.399
When volunteers took difficult calls

00:32:53.399 --> 00:32:58.179
she’d swoop in, imposing maternal hugs.

00:32:58.179 --> 00:33:00.500
Underpinning her increasingly smothering behaviour

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.090
was Marion’s growing conviction that she
could read people’s minds.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.539
Within the mental health field

00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:11.610
this is recognised as a classic sign of burn-out.

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.429
Practitioners come to believe they’ve seen
it all before

00:33:14.429 --> 00:33:17.990
and stop checking their assumptions.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.559
Things came to a head one week

00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:23.370
after a new volunteer took a distressing call.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:27.460
When Marion flung herself on him,
he fended her off.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.310
She was shocked at the rejection.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:33.720
The following week, she confronted him about
the brush-off

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.669
and asked him who taught him to reject love.

00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:40.960
When he dismissed the question, she became
more insistent

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.649
delivering a forceful speech about how he
was pushing his feelings down

00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:48.010
and how he shouldn’t be trying to help others

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:50.380
if he wasn’t willing to work on himself.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.140
She’d later feel the irony of those words.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.519
Her tirade disrupted the calls of her colleagues

00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:00.049
who reported it to management.

00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:01.880
It wasn’t the first complaint

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.190
and she was suspended pending an investigation.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:07.950
It was a body blow.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.679
Marion saw herself as an untouchable authority figure.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:16.869
To be subjected to disciplinary procedure
sparked pure rage.

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:19.560
She drove to the call centre after hours

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.790
smashed all her heart mugs and piled them
on a table

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:27.280
next to her resignation letter.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.369
Within a week she was begging to come back.

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:35.030
When the charity refused, she came to therapy

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.570
playing the victim.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:38.679
In her sessions

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:43.190
Marion realised how disconnected she’d become
from people.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.060
She cringed at how she’d bullied the new
volunteer

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.929
after his distressing call.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:51.159
What a horrible start for him.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:55.450
She conceded the helpline wasn’t where she
should be.

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:59.830
Marion came to understand the origins of her
compulsion to help.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.240
It had been a survival tactic

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:06.000
— a way to quickly anchor herself in new
company.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.310
She worked on forging healthier anchors.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:13.540
In our time together, I watched her blossom
in authenticity

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:18.190
as she shook off her dramatic role-based identity.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:24.040
Like Marion, Dimmy had become an overbearing
presence at work.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.390
For years he’d built a great reputation
at his gym.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:32.040
But in recent months he’d alienated some
long-term clients

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.280
with accusations of lack of commitment

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.790
and inappropriate comments about their personal
relationships.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:42.150
When we looked at what was going on in Dimmy’s
own relationships

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.660
he revealed that he’d recently become estranged
from his family

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.140
following some explosive exchanges.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.630
One of his brothers had announced that he
and his wife

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.350
were emigrating to her native Norway.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.800
Dimmy objected and tried to stop the move.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.880
For Dimmy, family was everything.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.910
After their father died, he’d worked hard
to keep everyone together.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:10.470
He’d helped his brothers find homes near
their mother’s house

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:14.480
so they could all live close together, spend
weekends together,

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.760
go on family holidays together.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.430
When partners started coming along

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.500
it hadn’t been easy to make them understand

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.920
how Dimmy wanted things done.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.579
But eventually they settled into his routines.

00:36:27.579 --> 00:36:32.730
Now his brother’s move threatened to destroy
everything.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.210
Dimmy started having nightmares about the
end of the world.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.369
He began showing up at his brother’s house
making scenes

00:36:40.369 --> 00:36:45.079
and accusing his sister-in-law of tearing
the family apart.

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:49.270
Family members who tried to reason with him
were accused of disloyalty.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.930
Eventually, his mother stepped in and told him

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:56.400
everyone was sick of his controlling behaviour.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.840
Things were going to have to change.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.770
For Dimmy, it was the ultimate betrayal.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.390
He stopped speaking to everyone.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:10.510
In therapy, Dimmy saw that everything was
tied up with his father’s death.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:11.900
When Dimmy was 10

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.440
his father became terminally ill with cancer.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:21.190
Dimmy became the hero child,
helping and protecting his family.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:24.450
This was reinforced by his dying father

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.190
who told Dimmy he was in charge now.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.560
He told him family was everything in life

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.630
and made Dimmy promise to keep everyone together.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:40.390
For over twenty years, Dimmy had been working
to keep that promise.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.750
In the early years, he’d been an extremely
positive force in the family

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.780
helping his mother, protecting and encouraging
his brothers.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:54.270
But over time, like other saviours who try
to preserve people in a timeless bubble

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.010
he’d become oppressive and dictatorial.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.910
Dimmy came to understand that it wasn’t his role

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:04.910
to take charge and keep everyone together.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:10.430
Letting go of his father’s promise was an
emotional experience for him.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:14.030
But he conceded his brothers 
weren’t children anymore.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.072
They had their own lives to lead.

00:38:17.072 --> 00:38:19.500
Despite the conflict of recent months

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.833
there was enough love in Dimmy’s family
to start over.

00:38:23.833 --> 00:38:29.186
And Dimmy was there to wave his brother goodbye.

00:38:29.186 --> 00:38:34.960
Helping is about identifying and addressing
the legitimate needs of a situation.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.990
When those things aren’t done

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.193
then whatever we think we’re doing, we’re
not helping.

00:38:40.193 --> 00:38:45.499
And we might be straying into a parody of
problem-solving called drama.

00:38:45.499 --> 00:38:50.708
It can be tough to give up the self-affirming
illusions drama offers us.

00:38:50.708 --> 00:38:54.697
And we can drift into some ugly harmful behaviour.

00:38:54.697 --> 00:38:57.160
When someone’s stuck in a dramatic role

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.000
they have to want to get out of it themselves.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.690
Attempts by others to coax them off the dramatic
stage

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.310
will often be twisted into more drama.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:13.068
But as the stories of Dimmy, Marion, Tyrone
and Gordon show

00:39:13.068 --> 00:39:16.899
all hope is not lost when saviours go bad.
