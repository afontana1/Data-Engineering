00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.620
People who make it out of groups like exploitative
religious and pseudoscientific organisations

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.540
are often faced with distortions from two directions.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.520
When they attempt to convey their experiences
of manipulation to members of their former group

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.240
their words are magically transformed
into 'I'm mad, evil and weak'.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.780
But when they share their story 
with non-members as a cautionary tale

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.460
their words are often magically transformed into
'I'm gullible, asinine and spineless'.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.300
After a while, the apostates realise
they're in the noonesland of the unheard.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.740
And it begins to become clear
why these groups continue to thrive —

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.960
groups with a talent for bending truth,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.820
preaching love while denouncing
non-members as a subhuman underclass;

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.520
claiming to champion peace,
while committing acts of barbarism;

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.420
pontificating about family values while
tearing up countless homes;

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.560
promising freedom and enlightenment while
enforcing ignorance and exercising total control

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.600
I want to explore some of
the mechanics of manipulative groups,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.160
dispatching some of the stereotypes
about the people who get recruited by them,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.000
and reflecting on preventive measures
we might take to avoid recruitment.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.460
But if there's just one thing
I really want to do in this video,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.540
it's to communicate the importance of
acknowledging a simple but profound fact:

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.749
we can be manipulated

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.620
At a press conference on manipulative groups

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.780
Ian reveals he lost tens of thousands of dollars

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.180
When he was recruited by a group who proposed that

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.800
clusters of alien spirits are attached
to all humans, keeping us from a full potential.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.980
Ian tells us how he and the other group members
paid through the nose — and every other orifice —

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.340
for a special kind of counselling which they
were told would rid them of these spirits.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.260
They were told that once these spirits were gone,
they would be the primary causal agents of their lives

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.960
with skills such as telekinesis, total recall
and mastery over illness.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.060
No evidence was given for any of this.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.880
The alien story was the unsubstantiated
revelation claim of the group's founder

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.660
and no records have ever been
produced of a single person

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.840
gaining any of the special powers
or knowledge described.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.920
What do we think of Ian?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.920
Does he lack intelligence?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.500
No. His intelligence is above average.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.780
He's a highly creative, resourceful man —&nbsp;that's why
the group considered him such a juicy prospect.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.380
Is he a bit credulous —
quick to accept whatever he's told?

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.560
No. In fact, by default, he's a cautious skeptical fellow.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.560
Is he driven by narcissism,
desiring supremacy over others?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.480
No. He's always been compelled
by deeply humanitarian instincts.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.720
Of course there are folks out there who are ....

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.260
gullible, obtuse, submissive,
power-hungry, escapist, lazy.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
But it's a huge mistake to assume that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.380
successful recruitment into manipulative groups
depends on the presence of these kinds of traits.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.740
And while we're hunting for them in Ian's case,
we're missing six crucial words:

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.680
'he was recruited by a group'.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.840
He was subjected to a process.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.780
The idea of alien spirit clusters wasn't presented
to him in the bald way he presented it to us.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.060
Ian was carefully steered
through a sequence of experiences

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.920
so that by the time the alien
spirits concept was mentioned

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.900
a range of key psychological elements had
been established

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.380
to ease its entry and help insulate it from criticism.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.080
Later on, I'll be looking at how this was done.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.100
Just as we can become distracted
by the red herring of personality deficiencies

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.720
we can become misled by the notion
of predisposing circumstance.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.920
Some psychologists have generated
lists of situational factors

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.500
that can leave us vulnerable to manipulative groups.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.040
Factors like 'weak family bonds'
or 'recent bereavement'.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.600
Problem is, when we don't find
ourselves reflected in those items,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.320
we can be left with the impression we're not vulnerable.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.860
When we see an item like 'weak family bonds'

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.380
we might satisfy ourselves that we not risk

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.520
because we have strong family bonds.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.380
But strong family bonds can put people at risk too.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.620
Many people are recruited by relative.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.740
And if your whole family's been indoctrinated,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.980
you could be born into a manipulative group.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.120
In these cases, even if you wake up
and smell the Kool Aid

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.220
strong family bonds might keep you
feeling trapped inside the group

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.180
under the threat of disconnection from your family.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.620
Members of manipulative groups are a
diverse population

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.400
and it serves us well to think creatively

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.160
about how these groups might hook us in.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.919
Some of us go through life convinced we
possess an almost clinical objectivity —

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.300
that, barring deliberate deceptions or the
odd quirky optical illusion,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.600
we generally perceived reality as it actually is;
and that we make decisions on a firmly rational basis.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.280
For over a century, social psychologists
 have been ripping that fantasy apart,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.760
conducting experiments that elicit the most bizarre,
counterintuitive human responses

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.560
and exposing a gamut of distinct biases

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.400
each of which distorts our perception
in its own specific way.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.280
A landmark concept in social psychology 
emerged in the 1950s

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.020
that provided a framework on which to untangle
all kinds of paradoxical human behaviour.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.980
Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.860
It also described arguably the biggest implement
in the toolboxes of manipulative groups

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.240
who not only rely on it to keep
existing members under their influence

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.760
but also actively exploit it to recruit new members.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.000
Festinger and his colleagues proposed that
 we seek consistency within our cognitions —

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.480
our thoughts, emotions, memories, perceptions —

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.080
and that when we discover an inconsistency
we experience a psychological discomfort

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.900
that motivates us to try and reduce that conflict.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.460
So, what does dissonance look like in action?

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.200
Say we've been told to believe
all members of group A evil.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.880
One day, a friend we've always known to be
a good person reveals she's a member of group A.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.620
This arouses dissonance because
our experience contradicts our belief.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.980
We can reduce this dissonance in a number of ways.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.680
If we're not hugely invested in the belief,
we might opt for method one:

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.240
simply adjust our belief.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.540
We might, for instance, change it to:
'not all members of group A are evil'.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.320
If we're equally invested
in the belief and the friendship

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.020
we might try to preserve both using method two: denial.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.260
We might refuse to believe
our friend is a true member of group A,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.200
granting her special exemption
because she's just not like those other folks.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.200
If we're more invested in the belief than
the friendship, we might go for method three:

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.200
select confirming information.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.120
Here, we cherry-pick information consistent with
our belief and ignore information that contradicts it.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.300
Any flaws in our friend's behaviour
or attitudes can be turned against her

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.160
while her goodness is ignored.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.460
Festinger and his colleagues noted
that when we experience dissonance

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.820
we'll tend to avoid information or situations
that threaten further dissonance.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.420
For instance, if we've denied that
our friend is a member of group A,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.440
we'll want to avoid the subject in future conversations.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.380
Or, if we've used selective information
to cast our friend as evil,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.160
we might quickly break off contact to avoid
giving her the chance to reason with us.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.100
But sometimes our response to dissonance
is so horrendously distorted

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.080
that it makes us almost
invulnerable to further dissonance,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.260
reducing our need for avoidance.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.980
For example, say we look for evidence
that our friend's evil, but can't find any?

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.420
What if — time after time — we're confronted with good?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.400
How can we possibly preserve a belief
that all members of group A are evil now?

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.820
Well, all is not as bleak as it seems.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.560
We have method four: repackaging.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.400
Believing that no member of
group A could possibly be good

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.340
We could repackage our experience 
of our friend's goodness as something it's not.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.360
We might tell ourselves she was only pretending
to be good — it was all an act, a deception.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.780
And isn't that the most insidious evil of all?

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.260
The evil that disguises itself as good?

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.100
The wolf in sheep's clothing?

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.820
We've now put our friend in a no-win position.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.900
Even her goodness has now
become evidence of her evil.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.780
Now we don't even have to avoid her.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.740
Anything she does — good or bad — confirms our belief.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.060
Later on, I'll be looking at how manipulative groups
explicitly employ these kinds of extreme contortions

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.360
to put their critics in a no-win position

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.640
and keep their members under psychological lockdown.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.760
Various experiments have shown how dissonance
can be actively exploited to induce positive responses.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.480
In a 1959 paper

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.520
Aronson and Mills investigated the role of initiation
procedures in attitudes toward groups.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.220
They advertised for female subjects to join
a group discussing the psychology of sex.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.580
But before being accepted, subjects were told
they had to pass an embarrassment test.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.580
There were three experimental conditions.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.940
Subjects in the 'severe initiation' condition

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.480
read out loud to the experimenter
a list of words considered obscene

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.880
as well as sexually explicit passages.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.020
Subjects in the 'mild initiation' condition read out loud a list of sexual but non-obscene terms.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.600
Subjects in the 'no initiation' condition weren't screened.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.920
Each subject then listened to the same pre-recorded
discussion,&nbsp;deliberately designed to be boring.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.300
They then rated their perceptions of the group.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.820
Intuitively, one might think the more severe the initiation

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.040
the more the discussion's
dreariness would be accentuated.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.560
But the reverse was true.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.160
Subjects from the 'severe' condition showed
the strongest liking for the group,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.560
rating it as significantly more attractive
compared with the ratings of the other groups.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.380
Aronson and Mills explained this counter-intuitive finding in terms of dissonance between two cognitions:

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.900
subjects in the 'severe' condition had gone through a difficult experience to join the group,

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.920
but the group wasn't worthwhile.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.320
When we invest time, effort, money,
emotion, in an enterprise

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.920
we want to believe our investment isn't wasted.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.040
So we repackage useless enterprises as useful.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.320
This result, supported by other studies,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.160
demonstrates how worthless groups
can be made to appear worthwhile.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.660
A decade later, Knox and Inkster showed
just how quickly actions can induce attitudes.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.760
At a racetrack, 69 bettors were asked
by one experimenter, just prior to betting

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.900
to rate the chances of their horse winning.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.500
72 bettors were asked by a second
experimenter, just after placing their bets.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.520
Using a 7-point scale, on average,
pre-bettors rated their chances 'fair'.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.220
Post-bettors rated their chances 'good'.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.440
One bettor, who'd given a rating
to the pre-bet experimenter and placed his bet

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.900
then spotted the post-bet experimenter
and asked if the two were working together.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.920
He then enquired if he could now
change his rating from 'fair' to 'excellent'.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.410
Studies like this show the important
role behaviour plays in dissonance.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.390
In fact, when we're looking at the
components of dissonance

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:47.290
we could divide them into three broad classes:
behaviour, emotions and thoughts.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.930
Pull hard enough on one and, in our drive
for consistency, the others will follow

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.600
When we behave as if we're committed,
our thoughts and emotions often fall in line.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.700
But how do we become
so heavily invested in an idea

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.780
that we find ourselves twisting
concepts into their opposites —

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.540
bending 'good' into 'evil', 'love' into 'hate' —
just to preserve that idea?

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.660
While cognitive dissonance studies tend
to focus on the conflict between two ideas

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.580
those two ideas don't of course exist in isolation.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.600
Networks of reinforcing ideas often lie behind them.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.380
For instance, regarding our
hypothetical belief that group A is evil

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.680
maybe our entire community has
always vehemently condemned group A.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.560
We might have behaved hatefully toward some
members of group A ourselves in the past

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.080
based solely on this prejudice.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.500
We might also have seen group A sympathisers
being attacked and ostracised.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.960
If it turns out group A isn't evil,
we have some tough realities to face.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.340
First, we have to admit
our entire community is wrong.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:49.220
This could tap into some hefty issues
around trust, loyalty and credibility.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.940
Second, we'll have to admit our own
hateful behaviour was unjustified.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.380
This could have big implications for our self-image.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.380
Third, we now face being attacked
and ostracised if we defend groups A

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.680
which taps into our ideas of safety and security.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.240
These tough realities might
feel intensely threatening to us.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.140
But the threat goes away if we can find some way
of preserving our belief that group A is evil.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:17.080
So it is that we might find ourselves turning on
our friend just to preserve a false belief.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.760
And of course this might in itself make it even harder
to admit our mistake in the future

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.920
because adding to all the other tough realities

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.360
we'll now have to admit we betrayed a good friend.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.040
Our minds are not objective, logical machines.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.660
Our minds are vast networks of ideas,
striving not necessarily for truth

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.660
but for internal consistency.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.400
In view of this, it's plain to see why childhood
is by far the most preferred period

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.100
for indoctrination into manipulative groups.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.880
Parents and guardians can
get in there right at the start

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.380
and insert any unsubstantiated concept they like

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.360
into the child's basic
initial framework without resistance.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.240
Being implanted so early

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.560
they stand a good chance of becoming core beliefs

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.500
with rich networks of ideas reinforcing them including
strong associations of identity of many levels —

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.860
individual, family, culture, perhaps nationality.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:13.420
If the unsubstantiated concept is later challenged,
threatening tremors could be felt in all of these areas.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.280
Indoctrinating adults who've already developed
an advanced cognitive network isn't so straightforward.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.700
Manipulative groups often have to
insert their unsubstantiated ideas

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.460
into a distinctly inhospitable environment.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.640
And it's no coincidence that in order to achieve that goal

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.540
some groups will try to mimic those
childhood conditions by infantilising adults.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.040
When I was a christian we were repeatedly told
that we needed to be like children —

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.180
trusting and dependent on Yahweh

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.300
which in the total absence of any evidence of Yahweh

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.940
translates to: 'trusting and dependent on
the humans who claim to represent Yahweh'.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.380
And there was a nice little threat
thrown in there.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.400
If you didn't become like children,
you'd never get into heaven.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.240
In a similar vein we were told:
'Lean not on your own understanding'.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.280
'Do not be wise in your own eyes'.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.080
The message in all these
commands couldn't be clearer.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.960
Wherever your ideas conflict with those of the group,
it's your ideas that need to change.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.100
Folks who submit to these commands can now have vast amounts of their cognitive network rewritten

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.160
without substantial resistance — just like childhood.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.640
Of course, adult recruits are more of a bonus
than a necessity for the major world religions

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.660
who are guaranteed a steady influx of child recruits

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.600
As long as the abuse of childhood
religious indoctrination continues.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.140
Other groups who are more reliant on adult recruits

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:33.170
often have to manipulate cognitive
dissonance in more subtle ways.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.230
Let's go back to Ian and see how he gets recruited

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.730
by a group claiming clusters of
alien spirits are attached to us all

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.420
keeping us from a full potential.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.160
Ian is approached on the street
by a woman with a personality questionnaire.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.320
He agrees to accompany her inside
the official premises behind her

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.460
where he spends half an hour completing it.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.830
His results show him to be
unstable, depressed, nervous and overly critical.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.600
These conflict with his self-image.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:09.200
But the woman talks with him for a further half hour about his life — his frustrations, his disappointments —

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.180
and draws tentative connections with his results.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.220
She says her group runs courses that can
help him become a more effective person.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.180
Ian's natural caution stops him
from signing up for a course

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.180
but he agrees to buy a cheap book.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.960
He now experiences his first cognitive
dissonance in the group's favour.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.880
He has two conflicting cognitions:
one, that he's not interested;

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.040
but two, that he's just invested an hour
of his time and bought a book.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.900
Dissonance leads him to adjust his first cognition
and rationalise that he is interested.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.500
Going home, he dips into the book and reflects on
the idea of becoming a more effective person.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.020
The questionnaire results begin to play on his mind.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.560
Despite himself, he begins
to select confirming information

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.820
finding memories that match the results.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.020
Deciding he has nothing to lose by
giving it a go, he returns

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.660
and signs up for a course on communication.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.580
Ian is now locked into a commitment cycle.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.260
The more time and money he invests,
the more he becomes convinced it's worthwhile

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.120
The easier he's persuaded to invest
more time and money in further courses.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.860
The courses include odd activities like
sitting in silence, staring at another member

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.640
or endlessly picking up the same object.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.280
These meaningless tasks confuse Ian

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.000
And induce trance states and hallucinations

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.800
increasing his susceptibility to direction.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.360
At the end of each course Ian has to
write up and read out loud to the group

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.040
how the course helped him.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.520
This forces him not only to find meaning
in the meaningless tasks

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.540
but to declare it publicly.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.520
Declaring benefits he doesn't
really feel creates dissonance

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.960
which Ian reduces by rationalising
that he does feel benefits.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.620
His dissonance is further reduced in two ways.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.760
First, Ian's speech receives huge praise
and applause from other members

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.540
validating his words and building on his feelings
of acceptance and loyalty to the group.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.620
Second, the testimony of other members further
justifies the idea that the tasks have meaning.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.840
Other activities train Ian not
to react to provocation.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.260
For instance, when being goaded with
insults and jokes by other members.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.140
Ian learns to disconnect from confrontation.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.120
He rationalises that this training
is helping him focus.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.179
It'll soon be put to other uses.

00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:14.599
Ian's told of the group's interest
in the betterment of humankind.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.260
Their aim is 'total freedom for everyone on the planet'.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.450
This resonates powerfully with
his own humanitarian concerns.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.110
But he's told about critics who want
to sabotage this important work,

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.880
spreading lies and alienating members.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.760
The group encourages Ian to avoid
mainstream media for this reason.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.540
He's always been against
censorship.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:38.520
But censorship has now been repackaged as
a sensible precaution against destructive critics.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.280
Thee group now controls
all information about the group.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.760
When later confronted by critics in person

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.100
Ian automatically disconnects
from them, as he's been trained to do

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.580
blocking out the very folks who could help him.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.080
In everyday life, Ian feels better, sharper, more confident

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.680
more effective.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.320
But it's an illusion.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.540
With the group's courses pitched at kindergarten levels,
in developmental terms, far from being stretched

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.720
Ian's been slowly regressing.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.660
After completing the basic courses

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.960
Ian's processed straight into the next level.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.100
A strange over-ritualised kind
of counseling is introduced

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.200
using lie-detector like technology

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.240
to gauge his emotional reaction as he
repeatedly confronts difficult memories.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.940
The aim is to nullify all emotional
reaction to past traumas

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.700
until it no longer registers on the apparatus.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.040
These counselling sessions are expensive.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.360
Sometimes very tiring. But he
frequently emerges feeling lighter.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.240
The sessions take him further and further into the past

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.460
until he's not quite sure if he's
dealing with real memories.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.740
Ian visits his parents. He talks about the group.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.540
His father is concerned about
the money Ian's getting through

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.860
and does an internet search on the group.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.780
He's disturbed at what he reads

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.620
and asked Ian to take a look

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.640
but Ian declines, saying it's all lies.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.340
When he tells the group about
his parents' reaction.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.540
Ian finds himself being interviewed at length

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.780
with concerns expressed about how
their influence could seriously damage his progress.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.780
At the end of an exhausting session

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.500
Ian agrees to only discuss
superficial subjects with his parents.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.700
He takes the issue to counselling
to nullify his emotional reaction.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.520
The groups' noble aim of total freedom for
everyone on the planet has been repackaged.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.820
'Total freedom' now means:
'freedom to do what the group allows'.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.720
'Everyone on the planet' now means 'everyone who remains uncritical of the group'.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.380
Three years and thousands of dollars later

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.220
Ian's completed two levels of counseling.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.560
He's also expecting his second child
with his new wife, also a member of the group.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.360
Time for level three.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.080
He's led into a room and shown a document
that tells him the following information:

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:48.760
Millions of years ago, an evil galactic ruler
transported billions of aliens to earth in spaceplanes

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.460
placed them around volcanoes

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.720
and blew them up with nuclear weapons.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.580
As they departed from their bodies,
the alien spirits were then captured in electronic traps

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.520
and subjected to a month-long 3d propaganda movie

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.980
that implanted false ideas in them
including the world religions.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.960
These alien spirits roamed the earth
aimlessly and when humans evolved

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.620
they attached themselves in clusters to their bodies.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.540
These alien spirits are what keep humans
from fulfilling their full potential.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.340
Ian now experiences perhaps the most
violent dissonance in his life.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.100
If he rejects the alien story, he's out.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.280
And all the time, energy and money
he's invested in the group has been wasted.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.740
The group's strict policy of shunning dissenters

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.280
also means the loss of his wife,
his children and all his friends.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.890
But beyond even these threatening realities

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.180
is a deep-seated belief that will
keep him under the group's influence

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.720
haemorrhaging money for another two years:

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.680
'I could never be manipulated'.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:49.480
To him, the only folks who fall for cons
are gullible, acquiescent, stupid.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.580
And that's just not him.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.280
And indeed that wasn't him

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.660
Nonetheless he was recruited.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.040
Not because of some personality deficiency.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.260
But simply because he's a human being

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:06.300
who — like all of us — possesses a brain
that's evolved to strive towards consistency.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.380
In his extreme state of dissonance

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:14.320
Ian is led directly into a counselling session
to nullify his emotional reaction.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.600
A few years ago, a woman wrote to me to tell me

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.340
she'd once thought I used demonic
psychological techniques in my videos.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.640
She'd been in a very controlling
fundamentalist religious group at the time

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:33.100
and was disturbed to find herself feeling persuaded by some of the atheist counter-arguments I was presenting.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.880
She was convinced I'd used satanic mind control
to put her under a spell.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.900
This was no random rationalisation. Her group had told her this was how the atheists got you.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.400
And she was terrified it had happened to her.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.800
To try and break the spell

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.260
she watched the same videos over and over
to figure out exactly how I'd corrupted her.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.820
It was during this process of analysis that she
came to realise the simpler explanation:

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.640
she'd been persuaded by legitimate counter-arguments.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.220
She then realised something else:

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.600
she'd become an atheist.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.880
This woman's story is an illustration of how manipulative groups develop strategies

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.680
to put critics in no-win situations.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.660
If I fail to persuade, I lose.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.720
If I succeed in persuading,
I must be cheating, therefore I lose.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.880
Manipulative groups often possess a
wealth of ready-made rationalisations

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.540
deviously designed so that their members'
cognitive dissonance is resolved in the group's favour.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.180
Some of them involve splitting
a single concept into two categories.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.920
We saw this with our hypothetical
friend from evil group A

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.680
whose goodness was invalidated by
repackaging it as a deception.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.600
Whatever good she did only proved her deceitfulness.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.040
Here, goodness was effectively split into
true goodness and false goodness.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.240
Group A's goodness was always false.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.620
The authors of the Bible perform
a similar split in regard to wisdom

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.900
dividing it into true godly wisdom and
false worldly wisdom.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.960
Worldly wisdom, which employs
human philosophy reason and logic,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.880
is dismissed in various books

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.940
including Proverbs and Romans.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.020
But 1 Corinthians goes further.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.380
In chapter 1, we're told that godly wisdom
appears foolish to the worldly wise;

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.820
that Yahweh has deliberately chosen foolish means
by which to confound the worldly wise

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.080
turning the worldly wise into fools.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.179
This repackaging of wisdom allows the group
to rebuff all criticisms out of hand.

00:23:16.179 --> 00:23:18.859
Of course the critics think their religion
is foolish!

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.080
Their God deliberately made their beliefs
incomprehensible to the worldly wise!

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.120
Manipulative groups sometimes try to shield themselves from their critics by keeping their beliefs secret.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.480
Some groups suggest their beliefs are so potent

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.100
they could strike down or even kill the uninitiated.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.180
When he was recruited into the Unification Church,
otherwise known as the Moonies,

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:42.740
Steven Hassan, a leading writer, speaker and
counsellor in the field of manipulative groups.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.360
was told: 'You wouldn't feed a baby
thick pieces of steak would you? ....

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.660
.... You have to feed a baby something
it can digest, like formula ....

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.160
.... Well these people are spiritual babies.
Don't tell them more than they can handle ....

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.580
.... or they'll die.'

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.220
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, founder of
pseudoscientific dianetics and scientology

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.180
suggested that if folks were told about
Scientology's Xenu (Xemu) creation myth

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.850
without appropriate preparation,
they might develop pneumonia.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:13.300
The Xenu story has become pretty common knowledge due to countless testimonies from ex-scientologists.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.140
But a global Xenu-induced pneumonia
epidemic has yet to be reported.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.520
Some groups claim it's pointless
to try and explain beliefs

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.440
that are too advanced for non-members to comprehend.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.120
Heaven's Gate was a UFO religious group

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.400
who committed mass suicide by ingesting
phenobarbital mixed into apple sauce

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.420
believing this would allow their souls
to be picked up on a spacecraft

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.300
trailing the Hale-Bopp comet.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.340
In a testimony video recorded shortly before their deaths

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.460
one member used the analogy of a person
on a doctoral degree in quantum mechanics

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.700
trying to explain to a second grader what he's learned.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.480
Another favourite manoeuvre used
by manipulative groups to deflect criticism

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.300
is to develop a persecution narrative.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:58.480
Here, rather than splitting a single concept into two,
the group will instead join distinct concepts into one.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.900
Persecution is about the systemic
mistreatment of an individual or group.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.660
It's about cruel and unfair behaviour.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:11.420
Where a group is angrily criticised and condemned
for social legal and/or ethical violations

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.020
that's not persecution. That's protest.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:19.140
Government officials jailed for criminally denying
the rights of people they personally deem unworthy

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.160
are not being persecuted for their religious beliefs.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.900
Parents jailed for letting children die
by denying them vital medical assistance.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.060
are not being persecuted for their religious beliefs.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:34.740
They're being punished for their own cruel and
unfair behaviour towards their fellow humans.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.760
By repackaging appropriate protest
and punishment as persecution

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.040
not only do manipulative groups
get to commit all kinds of abuses guilt-free.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.940
they get to feel like martyrs while they're doing it.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.180
Consoling them further are passages
from their holy books

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.520
that promise great rewards for being persecuted

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.280
— after they die of course.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.180
It's been put to me more than once

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.480
that critics don't stand a chance against
belief systems that are so psychologically ring-fenced

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.360
and can wield such gargantuan carrots and sticks.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.700
And yet critics to get through.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.840
Though the odds are stacked in the group's favour

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.740
dissonance isn't guaranteed to go their way.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.840
Time after time, something sticks.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.900
A phrase.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.980
An image.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.060
An argument.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.260
A question.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:23.800
That tiny fragment of clarity is sometimes all it takes
to instigate a process of self-extraction.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.960
So critics take heart — and speak out.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.810
Our minds are vast networks of ideas,
striving not necessarily for truth

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.960
but for internal consistency

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:45.040
so that that the injection of a false idea into
that network can have a domino effect

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.120
distorting the ideas around it.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.740
From this, three things become clear.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:56.060
One, the importance of anchoring our beliefs
in firm evidence and valid, sound logic.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.260
The more we lower these standards,
the easier false ideas slip inside.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.700
Two, the importance of getting
comfortable with not knowing.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.400
If we don't know whether an assertion is true or false

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.060
we need to be real about that.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.360
Taking the dishonest position of 'I know'

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.800
based on what we want to believe

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.960
could lead to false rationalisations
if future evidence contradicts us.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.240
Taking be honest position of 'I don't know'

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.860
mean future evidence can be assessed openly

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.840
Three, the importance of understanding
the techniques of manipulative groups.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.880
These groups are practiced at insinuating
false ideas into our cognitive networks

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.100
gradually turning our worlds upside down

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.740
so that while we think we're still grounded in reality

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.360
we've instead hooked ourselves to clouds.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.360
and we're drifting slowly away

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.560
from all sense and reason.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.800
One of the best preventative
measures against recruitment?

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.800
Learn about recruitment techniques.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.780
One of the best ways of doing that?

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.260
Listen to the stories of the people who've been there.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.540
Manipulative groups are often made
of folks just like you and me.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.320
That's what makes them so effective —
because the folks who recruit us are just like us.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:06.620
Another preventive measure is to disarm the beliefs
that can be used against us to induce dissonance.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.300
As Aronson and Mills showed

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.400
we're sometimes fooled into thinking that groups
who get us to jump through hoops are worthwhile

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.080
because we want to believe our time isn't wasted.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.600
That phrase 'want to believe' is like
a signpost, saying: 'Examine me!'

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.580
Is this belief justified or is it a wishful distortion?

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.620
The fact is our time is sometimes
wasted by undeserving pursuits.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.200
When we acknowledge that,
this particular manipulation is disarmed.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.840
And we can apply the same principle
to many other ideas we want to believe

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.420
that can be used against us.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.540
For instance, that we're always right
or that we can always judge a person's character.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.140
I'm sure you can think of other examples.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.940
I'll end on one: wanting to believe
we can't be manipulated.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.460
Of course we're manipulated all the time.

00:28:51.469 --> 00:28:53.949
Manipulated by adverts to buy products.

00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:56.729
Manipulated by loved ones to do favours.

00:28:56.729 --> 00:29:00.449
But if we ever have the misfortune
of getting recruited by a manipulative group

00:29:00.449 --> 00:29:06.020
this wishful distortion could block all our escape routes,
keeping us in a state of denial.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.660
Seems paradoxical, but the moment
we admit we can be manipulated

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.180
We instantly reduce our chances of being manipulated

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.200
because we become more open
to evidence that we have been.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.460
Chances are some folks watching this
are in a manipulative group right now

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.919
excusing their group's abuses and hypocrisies.

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:27.859
The more aware we are of their methods
and of our own human quirks and biases

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.260
the less successful they'll be in
keeping us doing what keeps them alive:

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.900
bending truth.
