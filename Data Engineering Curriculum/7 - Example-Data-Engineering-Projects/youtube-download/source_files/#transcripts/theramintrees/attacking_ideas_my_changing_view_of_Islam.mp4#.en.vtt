00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.760
Welcome to the marketplace of ideas.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.600
Here, ideas of every description
are attacked from every angle

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.860
to test how well they stand up to rigorous scrutiny.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.400
The marketplace is necessarily brutal

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.040
because its business is arguably
the most important business of humankind.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.360
The business of determining reality

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.740
—&nbsp;or the most reliable approximations
to reality that we can muster.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.640
In order to do that, the marketplace needs
to identify and eradicate false ideas

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.860
grounded in deception,  ignorance or error.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.960
In this gladiatorial arena, it pays not to
take too much for granted.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.440
Sometimes ideas that’ve enjoyed
the favour of the crowds for centuries

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.240
can be suddenly cut down by a new contender

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.460
just as the geocentric view of the universe
— in which the sun orbited the Earth —

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.180
was vanquished by the heliocentric view.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.460
There can be no room for favouritism.
Because bad ideas breed.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.080
Say we take the harmless act of singing.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.320
We claim the human voice wasn’t meant to sing.
It was meant to talk and call and shout.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.260
We propose that ‘singing is a decadent,
immoral perversion’.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.580
If we accept this idea without challenge or scrutiny,
where might it take us?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, first, it might simply discourage
individuals from singing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.740
But then it might enable another idea:

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
that ‘hearing other people sing corrupts our morals’.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.340
After all, hearing others sing
might make some folks think it’s ok.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.360
This might enable the idea
that we should stop other people singing

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.980
—&nbsp;which in turn might enable further ideas
about how to do that.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.200
Maybe ‘gag them’. Maybe ‘imprison them’. Maybe ‘kill them’.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.960
Left unchecked, bad ideas can take us down
very destructive paths.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.420
That’s why ideas need to be attacked forcefully,
and ideally at their root.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.640
If the root idea is eliminated,
its offshoots have nothing to draw on.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.760
It's not a blood sport. It’s a truth sport.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.060
If flawed are detected,
ideas can be eliminated or refined

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.440
so that what’s left standing should represent
progressively closer approximations to reality.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.900
But some ideas are left standing for other reasons.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.220
Some ideas have enjoyed the special
privilege of immunity from criticism.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.260
For centuries, religions have relied on extreme
fear tactics to crush all challenge.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.620
Folks proposing unorthodox changes to their religion
— often to try and reform serious abuses

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.600
— have been labelled ‘heretics’.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.320
Folks declining to respect the particular taboos of a religion

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.600
— whether or not they’re members of that religion —
have been labelled ‘blasphemers’.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.380
And on charges of heresy and blasphemy,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.980
countless humans down the centuries have been
shunned, imprisoned, censored and killed.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.180
But many folks have grown sick of being intimidated
into silence

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.840
about the dehumanising prejudices and violations
embedded in these protected religions.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.020
And, in many parts of the world

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.900
threats of punishment for blasphemy
have lost their power.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.300
But in recent years, a new tactic
has emerged to try and shut critics down,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.260
attempting to conflate the crucial business of attacking
ideas with the reprehensible attacking of people.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.500
Instead of ‘blasphemers’, critics of religious ideologies

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.600
have been collectively labelled
‘prejudiced’, ‘racist’, even ‘phobic’

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.680
insinuating that their objections
necessarily stem from irrational fear

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.360
rather than a sober consideration of the evidence.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.860
And it’s been interesting to see how this tactical shift
has been received in the marketplace of ideas.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.300
The marketplace has long championed ideas like
‘prejudice is unfair’ and ‘racism is unjust’.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.920
And, on that basis

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.000
for a while it seemed the marketplace
was hoodwinked by these recent imposters

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.220
— these false definitions of prejudice and racism.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.280
But, like the religious ideologies
they’re designed to protect

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.980
these fake accusations themselves are now
coming under the scrutiny of the marketplace.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.520
And they’re swiftly losing their punch.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.820
Watching this new wave of religion-defending play out in the marketplace of ideas

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.540
has a personal resonance for me.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.340
Years ago, I went through a similar period
of religion-defending in my own marketplace.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.780
We each possess our own exclusive
marketplace — called a mind —

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.820
where we privately assess the ideas that
come our way.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.520
Compared to the public marketplace

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.700
which can draw on the vast experience and skills 
of many minds to attack ideas with maximum rigour

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.780
the internal marketplace is
a distinctly inferior environment.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.660
without other minds to compensate for our biasses,
our ignorance and other personal weaknesses,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.400
the end-products of our internal marketplace
are much more vulnerable to distortion.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.040
And it’s because of distorting factors like these that, 
for many years, I defended a religion called Islam.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.740
In the spirit of transparency, I want to share some of the
key events that shaped and reshaped my attitudes,

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.660
including a childhood incident that coloured my outlook

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.960
a descent into fierce dissonance

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.100
and some experiences with a handful
of wonderful Muslims and ex-Muslims

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.280
who helped me dismantle my defenses
and look again at what I’d been defending.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.640
One day, at the age of eight, I was out
roller-skating with my best friend

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.300
a boy from a Turkish family who I’ll call Bora.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.920
We’d been skating round the local streets
when a wheel came loose on one of Bora’s boots.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.880
By chance, we were near my grandparents’ house,
so I called on my grandfather to help fix it.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.600
While he looked at the roller skate,
my grandmother took me to one side.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.580
In a tone of concern, she asked,
‘Your friend isn’t a Muslim is he?’

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.720
I’d heard Bora use that word.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.260
But my Christian indoctrination only exposed me
to the Biblical religions: Christianity and Judaism.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.980
I’d heard about Buddhism, but only from watching
a dubbed Japanese TV show called ‘Monkey’

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.180
in which a monkey king, along with a pig-monster
called Pigsy, and a swamp monster called Sandy

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.120
accompany a Buddhist monk Tripitaka
on a pilgrimage to India.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.440
But Islam was nowhere on my radar.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.880
Bora was always teasing me in Turkish

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.120
so I’d assumed ‘Muslim’ was another Turkish word
— and I was baffled to hear my grandmother using it.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.080
I asked her, ‘How did you know?’

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.900
In response, she looked terrified
and gripped my arm hard

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.060
telling me, ‘Whatever you do, don’t tell your grandfather!’

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.260
She said a Muslim killed his brother.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.280
And if he found out my friend was a Muslim,
he might take his revenge.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.400
It was one of those hallucinatory moments
where the world stops making sense.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.720
I looked back at Bora joking around with my grandfather, unaware of any threat.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.520
It was nightmarish.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.780
My grandfather seemed to take ages
to repair the roller skate.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.880
Every second I feared my
grandmother’s question would occur to him.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.440
The moment the skate was fixed, I flustered a quick thanks and got Bora to race me down the road.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.280
After a few blocks, my panic subsided,
but my disorientation remained.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.840
Punishing the innocent for other people’s wrongdoings
was common practice in the Bible.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.240
Children were cursed because
of their parents’ transgressions.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.840
Humankind was cursed because the first two humans disobeyed the Christian god Yahweh.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.140
From the very start, this misdirected punishment
had never made any sense to me.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.870
But it seemed even more irrational in real life.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.440
What could my grandfather achieve by attacking Bora? He might as well attack a tree.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.640
I didn’t know the word ‘prejudice’ yet. But I knew
what I’d just encountered felt ugly and alien.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.560
When we eventually stopped for a rest,
Bora said what a nice man my grandfather was.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.220
I said nothing.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.820
I was desperate to know what ‘Muslim’ meant.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.140
But I was afraid to ask anyone.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.100
Still thinking it was Turkish,
I didn’t bother with dictionaries.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.320
And this was years before the internet.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.580
Months later, when Bora spoke the word again,
I saw my chance and asked him about it.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.860
And discovered there was another religion in the world.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.260
I became very protective of Bora,
and, by extension, other Muslims.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.320
At age 11, I moved to secondary school
and finally got some religious education.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.420
Aside from teaching us about its rituals and festivals

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.460
our teacher taught us that
Islam was the religion of peace

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.640
and that its holy book, the Qur’an,
promoted support for science.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.820
This ticked some great boxes. I imagined
a religion full of friendly intellectuals.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:46.220
But, in 1989, that image was shaken by news
reports of an Iranian Muslim leader called Khomeini

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:51.000
declaring a death sentence on author
Salman Rushdie for an allegedly blasphemous novel

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.940
called ‘The Satanic Verses’.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.260
At first I dismissed it as a joke.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.320
Muslims wouldn’t act like this.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.520
When I found out Khomeini’s decree was genuine
I was stuck for an explanation.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.280
It was so medievally barbaric.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.080
I concluded Khomeini wasn’t a real Muslim

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.340
— just a demagogue, trying to exploit Muslims
for his own political gains.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.640
The news was awash with
British Muslims burning the book,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.740
and swearing to kill Rushdie.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.520
I concluded these would-be assassins
couldn’t be genuine Muslims either.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.080
And I hoped Islam would  soon
loudly re-assert its true nature.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.980
As I started university

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.180
the Rushdie affair had died down and I’d lulled myself
into believing peace was restored

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.380
Jameena and I arrived early
on enrollment day and got talking.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.880
I was impressed to discover

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.600
she’d already been credited in a published paper
on the evolution of the human hand.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.480
As I got to know her, I found her to be
a witty, open and warm individual.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.380
When she heard I liked to cook, she plied me
with an endless stream of amazing recipes.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.880
One day, after finally reading her evolution paper

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.720
I mentioned the anti-evolution sentiment
I’d experienced in Christianity

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.020
and I complimented Islam’s commitment to science.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.740
With a candour that must’ve come easy
in the face of my idealism

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.060
Jameena gingerly corrected
some of my misconceptions.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.120
There was no core commitment to science in Islam.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.120
In fact, there was extreme resistance to any science
that conflicted with Islamic teaching.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.320
Regarding evolution, she said
Muslims held a range of views.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.200
Some considered it blasphemous.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.500
Others had no problem with it as long as humans were excluded.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.440
Others endorsed divinely guided evolution.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.480
But she knew very few Muslims who
shared her acceptance of natural human evolution.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.020
Even within her own family, she’d had to
limit who she told about her evolution paper.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.600
It was a great disappointment to hear all the same
resistances I’d heard in my old Christian community.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.760
I started to pay closer attention
to actual Muslim attitudes to science

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.200
and realised my religious education teacher’s mistake.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.840
The claim wasn’t that the Qur’an was a supporter
of science, but that it was supported by science

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:08.400
— ie that the ideas in this 1400-year-old book
were substantiated by modern scientific findings.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.260
Among the examples I heard was a claim that science
showed that mountains keep the land in place

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:19.360
supporting Qur’an passages in which Allah set down mountains like pegs to stop the land shaking.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.460
Of course, what science actually showed

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.640
was that far from being pre-existing
pegs that stop land movement

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.700
mountains were the product of ongoing land movement

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.300
formed by the collision of the
Earth’s slowly moving plates.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.879
Earthquakes&nbsp;— literally ‘land shakes‘ —

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.200
were an even more obvious falsification of the claim.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.140
Unscientific holy books were nothing new to me.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.740
I’d long been aware of similar flaws in the Bible.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.260
For instance, Yahweh’s depicted
creating plants before creating the sun.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.000
So lifeforms that relied on photosynthesis
had no photo to synthesise.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.800
But it was Jameena’s comment about
Muslim attitudes towards evolution

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.560
that stayed with me
and raised some unsettling thoughts.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.840
Not always, but sometimes

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.420
a rejection of evolution was associated with bogus ideas
about what humans are ‘designed’ for.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.839
I’d experienced aggressive outbursts about
evolution from some Church of England Christians

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.600
and Jehovah’s Witnesses — and it was no
coincidence that these same folks

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.500
had extremely fixed views on issues
like gender and sexuality.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.360
They believed their god Yahweh 
‘designed’ women as subordinates to men

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.960
and ‘designed’ humans to be exclusively heterosexual.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:36.360
I realised if Islam promoted these kinds of fixed gender
and sexual roles, that could spell big trouble.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.000
The Qur’an was claimed to be the perfect word of a god,
conveyed verbatim by an angel.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.420
Much harder to face the possibility of human error

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.080
if you believe your scripture’s dictated
by a god instead of merely inspired by one.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:55.060
But, just as it did with the Rushdie affair,
the phrase ‘religion of peace’ eased my concerns.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.040
Within weeks of meeting Jameena, I met Parinda.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.000
We enrolled as volunteers at the same charity
and quickly became pals.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
One day, the subject of partners came up,
and Parinda revealed she was divorcing her husband.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
She said it was an extremely complicated
business. I asked why she was divorcing him.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.940
After a long pause, she said, ‘Domestic abuse.’
Then it was like watching a dam burst.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.160
The whole story gushed out of her.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.980
For years, he’d beaten her

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.240
— always careful to target parts of her that
couldn’t be seen and never leave permanent marks.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.320
When she’d told her parents, they’d sided with him

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.080
suspecting her of being a rebellious wife.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.960
In desperation, she’d thrown herself down some concrete stairs, breaking several bones.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.200
She hadn’t cared whether she’d be hospitalised or die.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.880
She just didn’t want to spend every moment in fear.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.160
It was only when they saw her in hospital that
her parents’ finally changed their attitude

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.980
and supported her divorce.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.720
I couldn’t imagine defending someone who
beat my child. Parinda said it wasn’t their fault.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.680
It was what their religion taught them.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.460
She said Islam instructed husbands
to beat rebellious wives.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.540
It even warned women that the angels cursed wives
who refused their husbands’ sexual demands.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.279
I didn’t believe Islam would promote
such dehumanising values.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.060
Privately, I figured Parinda
was taking scripture out of context.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:25.240
But the abuse and lack of support she’d suffered
was horrifying, and I was relieved it was over.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.680
A couple of weeks later, Parinda arrived
in a clearly agitated state.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.340
We went outside for a private chat
and I asked what was up.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.620
She said her brother’s son had come out to her as gay.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.100
It was unlike her to have an issue with sexuality.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.520
I asked what the problem was.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.440
She said she was afraid for him.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.780
I said I was sure he’d be ok —
folks were more enlightened these days.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.620
She said I didn’t understand.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.700
If her brother found out, he’d take
his son back to India and bury him alive.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.920
I had to check I hadn’t misheard. She confirmed I hadn’t.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.260
Even as an empty threat,
the idea was unthinkably wicked.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.620
But Parinda clearly took it seriously.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.640
I said Islam must condemn such violence.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.600
She said Islam was the source
of these murderous ideas.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.000
In a conspiratorial whisper,
she told me Islam wasn’t what I thought it was.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.040
She said the Muslims in her community

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.140
wanted outsiders to think
they embraced values like freedom and equality.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.380
But they really didn’t.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:32.100
So, fixed gender and sexual roles —&nbsp;both of which I’d
predicted would be especially disastrous within Islam —

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.820
—&nbsp;had now been presented as part of Islamic doctrine.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.780
I could’ve responded to this information by
picking up a Qur’an, or investigating the Hadith

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:46.280
— the multi-authored reports of the life of Muhammad
written and collected years after his death.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.880
But I simply didn’t feel the need.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.840
A religion of peace would
never sanction wife-beating and murder.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.320
I figured Parinda was making up
stories to try to excuse her parents’ betrayal

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.820
and her brother’s pathological homophobia.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.340
It was understandable. They were family.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.160
Of course, she’d want to pretend they weren’t
responsible for their hateful ideas.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.900
But I couldn’t support her delusions.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.800
And in the following weeks,
whenever she criticised Islam, I stayed silent.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.400
She soon got the message
and dropped the subject.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.380
On her final day, I barely recognised the
woman who walked in.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.400
No hijab. Just an elegant trouser suit.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.200
I said, ‘You look different.’

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.320
She said she’d realised criticising her community
in secret achieved nothing.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:36.200
She wanted to align herself visibly
with the values of freedom and equality she held dear.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.920
Disapproving comments had already been conveyed
to her parents in the last week

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.260
from folks who’d seen her on the street.
But she didn’t mind.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.120
She said it might spark some useful discussion.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.460
After she’d said her goodbyes to everyone else,
I went outside with her.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:56.040
She said she loved my faith in people
—&nbsp;and she hoped they didn’t disappoint me.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.500
She gave me a tearful hug and drove away.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.640
I met Oz on a one-day workshop in existential therapy.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.360
The day began with an ice-breaking exercise
in which we stood in a circle

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:17.100
and someone would step into the centre and share
a personal characteristic that wasn’t visibly obvious.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.020
Everyone who shared that characteristic
would join the person in the centre.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.860
Then we’d resume our positions
and someone else would have a go.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.100
In one of my turns, I stepped in
and said, ‘I’m an atheist’.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.320
Among the folks who joined me in the centre was Oz.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.660
When he returned to the wider circle,
he had an irrepressible grin.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.700
Over the morning, we paired up as exercise partners.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:45.840
And when lunch time came, I invited him to a local cafe
where we had a spell-breaking conversation.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.320
He told me that was his first confession
of atheism and he was still buzzing.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.180
I asked him about his path out of Islam.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.740
He asked if I’d heard of ‘The Satanic Verses’.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.480
He’d been a teenager during the Rushdie
incident.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.740
He’d seen his fellow Muslims’
anger and resentment about the book.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:06.200
They’d approached the publishers
—&nbsp;even the police — to stop its circulation.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.020
But no action was taken. So they took to the streets.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.260
Oz said the London demonstrations were exhilarating.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.640
And afterwards there was a sense of relief and vindication when the protests dominated the news

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.500
sending the message: ‘We exist!’

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.700
But his mood changed when he saw
the concerned reactions of non-Muslims.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.360
People spoke of living among
a religion full of mindless assassins.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.860
Neighbours they’d befriended were backing off.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.640
Even his classmates were asking
if he wanted to kill Rushdie.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.700
Publicly, he denounced these reactions as
ignorant and prejudiced.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.140
But privately, he knew he and his family
had felt great pride

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.900
when news reports showed British Muslims
vowing to kill Rushdie.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.480
He realised he couldn’t have it both ways
—&nbsp;wanting Rushdie dead

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.760
but crying ‘prejudice’ when correctly
suspected of wanting Rushdie dead.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.820
To sort out his position, he did what neither Khomeini
or anyone in Oz’s community had done.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.460
He read the book.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.420
He obtained a copy which he read in secret.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:10.100
But instead of gratuitous scandal, he found
a witty, insightful novel

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.520
that magically voiced many of his own feelings
about identity and belonging

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.960
— and underscored the need
to question what we’re told.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.040
Oz realised he’d been deceived about Rushdie

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.800
— and that he and his fellow Muslims had
allowed themselves to be whipped up by their leaders

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.560
into a completely false sense of victimhood.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.580
He made subtle hints to his family
about reading the book

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.600
but soon realised they were impervious
to reason or evidence.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.480
Vowing he’d never be like that, he began
questioning his own firmly held beliefs.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.540
Before long, he was an atheist,
exploring humanist ideas.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.320
Oz’s story aroused a deep anxiety in me.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.400
As we headed back to the existential therapy workshop

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.700
I asked him if he thought
he’d ever come out to his family.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:02.180
He said his parents’ country executed people
for leaving Islam — and they supported that penalty.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.460
He wryly noted the double-standard of Muslims who
demanded acknowledgement for their own existence

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.260
while privately wishing to end the existence of others.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.580
For me, this was the tipping point.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.300
The tutor began the afternoon session
with a talk about the loss of meaning

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.960
which was exactly what I was experiencing.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.500
It was a familiar hallucinatory feeling.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.460
A feeling that the world suddenly made no sense.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.540
Out of nowhere, the roller-skate incident
with Bora bubbled up in my mind.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.800
I hadn’t thought of it for years.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:39.720
I remembered my eight-year-old self, rooted
to the spot, terrified for my best friend.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.820
And I realised that in my eagerness to defend
him, I’d given Islam a completely free pass.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.580
Defending an innocent friend
from a perceived threat made sense.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:56.380
Defending an ideology I’d never scrutinised was absurd.
The free pass was revoked.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.000
Recalling the roller-skate incident with a
clear head led me to revoke something else.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.540
I realised that, till the day he died, I’d never once heard
my grandfather express any anti-Muslim feeling.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.760
I’d found him guilty of murderous prejudice
based purely on my grandmother’s fears.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.440
I now corrected that verdict to ‘not guilty’.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.000
When the workshop ended, I thanked Oz
for sharing his story with me.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.880
From that day, over ten years ago,I began to unravel
the mess I’d got myself into over Islam.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:33.320
That process of unravelling
underscored a number of ideas.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.200
Idea one: distorted ideas backfire.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.340
When we set out to defend something —&nbsp;whether it’s
a group of people, an ideology or a principle —

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.620
— it’s crucial to have an accurate
understanding of that thing

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.920
or we could end up actively
opposing the very thing we think we’re fighting for.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.740
In striving for a distorted idea of freedom

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.700
— one that only grants freedom to those
we agree with —

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:03.860
we could end up opposing freedom, becoming
authoritarian, controlling, even totalistic.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.620
In striving for a distorted idea of equality

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.700
— one that denies natural variations
in preferences between groups —

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.040
we could end up advocating gross inequalities.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.600
In striving to support Muslims,
I ended up denying support to Parinda

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.380
because of my distorted idea of Muslims.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.160
The roller-skate incident and
my one-sided religious education

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:30.700
led me to define Muslims in a very narrow way:
as peaceful and vulnerable.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.300
To some folks, that might sound
like a positive image to have of Muslims

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.060
—&nbsp;one that should inspire protectiveness towards them.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.680
But it inspired denial.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.460
Khomeini was violent and oppressive.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:49.300
But because that contradicted my idea of Muslims,
I denied that he or his followers were real Muslims.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.120
When Jameena revealed Muslims
had no intrinsic commitment to science,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.880
I was able to accept that.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.480
Disappointing as it was, it didn’t contradict the peaceful, vulnerable image.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:05.640
But when Parinda linked the oppressive values
of her husband and family to Islam, my denial returned.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.460
These values had to be down to personal flaws
that had nothing to do with Islam.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.460
This meant Parinda was not credible.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.020
So, paradoxically, viewing Muslims as peaceful
and vulnerable

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.080
was what caused me to disbelieve
a peaceful, vulnerable Muslim.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.740
Ironically, if I’d taken the opposite distorted view
—&nbsp;defining Muslims as oppressive and violent —

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.500
I could’ve accepted Parinda’s story.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.020
I say ironically because I wouldn’t’ve got to hear it.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.100
Viewing her as an oppressive Muslim too,
I wouldn’t’ve befriended her.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.060
So Parinda loses either way.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:47.880
These are the ironies and paradoxes that can arise when
we define any broad group in a distorted way.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.520
Viewing people as exclusively virtuous or
exclusively wicked is called ‘splitting’

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.440
because we split off the parts we don’t
want to acknowledge.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.020
When we demonise people,
we split off the positive parts.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.300
When we canonise people, we split off the negative.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:09.060
A warning sign that we’ve demonised people is that
nothing they do, however positive, is good enough.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.300
They can perform great acts
of charity and philanthropy.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.040
We’ll find ways of dismissing them
as fake and self-serving.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.780
Demonised people are ‘guilty until proven guilty’.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.140
Conversely, a warning sign that we’ve canonised people

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.660
is that nothing they do,
however negative, is bad enough.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.600
They can commit all kinds of slanders and attacks.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.960
We’ll find ways of excusing every transgression.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.600
Canonised people are ‘innocent until proven innocent’.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:43.040
The solution to splitting is to recognise that
people aren’t all-good or all-bad but simply human

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.160
capable of the full range of human traits.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.820
When I started seeing Muslims
as humans, instead of martyrs

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.020
I was able to admit all the reality I’d previously denied.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.800
Khomeini and his followers were real Muslims.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.340
The values of Parinda’s husband and family
did have something to do with Islam.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.780
And Parinda was credible — and deserved support.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.680
This leads to idea two: ideas are everything.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.120
For many years, I deluded myself
that Religious Education at school

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.000
had given me a pretty rounded knowledge of Islam.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.200
Those classes certainly taught me swathes of jargon.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:28.200
Rakat, Zakat, Hajj, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha,
Muezzin, Qur’an, Hadith, Sira.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:34.060
I wrote countless essays explaining these and other
terms, comparing them with elements in other religions

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:40.400
— comparing religious festivals, religious fasting
practices, religious buildings, and so on.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.460
What was missing from those classes?

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.620
The actual ideas promoted by these religions.
The social values. The politics.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.360
The foundational beliefs. The stuff that mattered.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.480
These vacuous classes gave the impression
that religions were interchangeable;

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.420
that the underlying beliefs were basically the same.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.520
— they just had different festivals, books and buildings.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.060
But religions aren’t interchangeable.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:09.760
They promote vastly different ideas,
shaping human lives in vastly differently ways.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.300
Heavens Gate was a UFO religion

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:17.260
whose founder Marshall Applewhite taught his followers
to gradually disown their physical bodies

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:22.240
which were referred to as ‘vehicles’, making
them seem temporary and disposable.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.900
Members were even encouraged to undergo
castration to eliminate their sexuality.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.660
Eventually, we saw the results of this grooming.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.100
Almost 20 years ago to the day

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.960
Applewhite persuaded the group to commit 
mass suicide by ingesting phenobarbital

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.660
having told them their spirits would be picked up
by a spaceship trailing the Hale-Bopp comet

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.200
and transferred into a ‘Next level body’.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.980
Now, imagine if Heaven’s Gate had succeeded
in becoming a major world religion,

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.220
gaining hundreds of millions of followers worldwide,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:58.920
with huge groups of them intermittently committing
suicide every time a comet passed by the Earth.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.500
Would you be happy for this religion
to be presented to your children

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.660
as no better or worse than all the other religions?

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.040
Would you be happy for them to learn its jargon

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.620
— like ‘vehicle’ and ‘Next level body’ — without any
critical discussion of its core ideas?

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.840
More to the point,&nbsp;would having
concerns about this religion

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:22.180
mean you were suffering from an irrational
fear called ‘Heaven’sGateophobia’?

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:28.500
When it comes to religion, ideas are everything.
If we don’t know the ideas, we don’t know the religion.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.160
To gauge the ideas of a religion,
we need to see how it’s lived.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.600
Simply reading the ideas in its holy scripture doesn’t necessarily do that.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.640
Among those condemned to death
in
the Jewish torah are sabbath-breakers.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.140
But we don’t see endless reports of modern Jews
killing people for working on the sabbath.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.320
The Jewish judicial body that enforced these laws —&nbsp;known as the Sanhedrin —

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.640
was dissolved centuries ago.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.080
If it was reestablished, things might look very different.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.280
Unlike Judaism, Islam has a very active religious
judicial system called Sharia

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.780
which informs the official laws of several countries

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.980
and which some hope to see
implemented in other countries.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:11.500
That gives Islam a unique political leverage
to impose its scriptural ideas on people.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.660
And all the oppressive ideas conveyed
by Parinda and Oz have found support.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.140
In 2016, Pakistan’s Council of Islamic Ideology

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:26.660
supported wife-beating for a range of offenses
including refusing sex without a religious excuse

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.580
not wearing a hijab, and talking to strangers.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.460
This is based on Surah 4, verse 34 of the Qur’an

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.600
— a verse expressing ideas
that should’ve long ago died away

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.980
but are still widely perpetuated and defended.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.620
Homosexuals are sentenced to death

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.760
in honour killings and official executions.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:51.280
One Muslim cleric, speaking at a US University 
in 2013, called it an act of compassion.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:57.180
He later clarified this, explaining that
killing homosexuals was in their best interests

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.180
because they’d sin less.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.060
And Oz was right about
Islam’s death penalty for leaving Islam

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.380
which is implemented in accordance with Sharia.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.760
We sometime judge complex systems
like religions on woefully inadequate evidence.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.700
If the only Muslims we knew
were peaceful, kind and liberated

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.440
we might use them as the
basis for our perception of Islam.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.400
Conversely, if we read some of the violent, supremacist
passages contained within Islamic scripture

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.379
we might assume all Muslims support those ideas.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:34.280
Getting to know a religion is about seeing
how its ideas shape the lives it touches.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.420
This leads to idea three:
splitting breeds polarisation.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.940
When we start loudly promoting an all-good
or all-bad image of any broad social group

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.180
we’ll often find other voices spring up
— loudly promoting the opposite view.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:55.880
The all-bad group, unable to see the good,
is mystified by the all-good group’s obvious denial

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.420
and presses its own position harder.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:04.580
But the all-good group, unable to see the bad, is equally
mystified by the all-bad group’s obvious denial

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.300
and does the same.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:12.120
Focussing on each other’s denial, both groups push
each to greater extremes of polarisation.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.960
The all-good group blocks progress
by denying all problems.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.380
The all-bad group blocks progress by denying all hope.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.880
To resolve the deadlock,
both groups need to recognise their own denial

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.760
— and acknowledge the problems and the hope.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.520
Let me outline some of those problematic and hopeful areas.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.060
There are Muslims who despise secularism
and Muslims who support it.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.620
There are Muslims who reject criticism
and Muslims who welcome it.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.680
There are Muslims who want to push the
whole world back to seventh century Islam

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.880
and Muslims who want to drag Islam
into the 21st century world.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.500
There are Muslims who respond violently to cartoons
and Muslims who brush them off.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:57.820
There are Muslims who try to deflect legitimate criticism of Islam
with double-talk

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.720
and Muslims who condemn this double-talk
and work to expose it.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.760
We don’t have to respond to the voices we disagree with

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.620
by pretending they don’t exist
or pretending they’re not real Muslims.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:17.000
We can just disagree with them —&nbsp;and support
the voices more aligned with our values.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.200
Which leads to idea four: allow all voices.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.120
It’s the essential spirit of the marketplace of ideas.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.620
Allow all voices to be heard and
let the ideas they promote be scrutinised.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:36.019
Let any deceptions and evasions be uncovered.
Let any oppressive agendas be exposed.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:43.320
For this to happen, we need a level playing field. But for
centuries, one side has been systematically silenced.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.400
For many non-Muslims, the Salman Rushdie
fatwa was the first indication

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:53.100
of the price paid by Muslims and ex-Muslims
who are perceived in any way to be critical of Islam.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:59.840
Another indication came in 2004, when Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Theo van Gogh made a film called ‘Submission’

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.400
criticising the oppression of Muslim women.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.720
Van Gogh was assassinated, with a death threat
to Hirsi Ali pinned to his body with a knife.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.600
We see the same pattern in the emancipation
of so many oppressed groups.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.240
The first critical voices are dealt with brutally
to discourage further resistance.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.120
But the balance can shift when
enough voices emerge and spread the risk.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.300
More critical Muslim and ex-Muslim voices
are slowly finding greater prominence

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.920
but still being subjected to attack.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.920
Raheel Raza received death threats after leading
a mixed-gender congregation in prayer.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.060
In what’s been described as a Rosa Parks-style
act of civil disobedience

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.720
Asra Nomani entered a West Virginia mosque
through the men’s door

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.880
and refused to move from
the men’s section during prayers.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.880
Nomani and her parents
were subsequently threatened with death.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.320
When former London imam Usama Hasan expressed
public support for the theory of evolution,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.179
an online leaflet appeared and was later distributed
at the mosque, charging Hasan with disbelief

00:32:59.179 --> 00:33:02.640
and quoting rulings of execution in similar cases.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.040
Maajid Nawaz has made a habit of inviting his fellow
Muslims to join him in condemning punishments

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.020
like dismemberment for theft and
the stoning to death of adulterers.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.400
Those he invites persistently decline to do so.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.740
Opponents of Nawaz have incited
international assassination threats.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:25.000
Death threats are the norm for Muslims
and ex-Muslims who dare to criticise Islam.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.860
They take risks some would find unthinkable

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.980
to highlight real problems rooted in Islamic scripture

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.320
that are much more common
than some of us might like to imagine.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.220
Some of their stories might be difficult and painful to listen to.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:43.840
But the stories of future generations could be
a lot more painful if we don’t start listening.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.840
Which leads to idea five: reassessing a cliche.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:54.040
In a 2015 interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria,
Barack Obama said:

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:58.720
‘It’s very important for us to align ourselves
with the 99.9% of Muslims

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.520
who are looking for the same things
we are — order, peace, prosperity.’

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:10.140
When referring to peaceful Muslims, this figure
of 99.9% is so commonplace it’s become a cliché;

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.810
a reflex soundbite, uncritically accepted as truth.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:18.980
Let’s look at this figure in relation to
two specific practices promoted within Islam:

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.940
the stoning to death of adulterers and the
execution of apostates.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.160
Two questions.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.600
First: What percentage of Muslims
do you think support these practices?

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:36.360
Second: At what percentage level would you
personally start having serious concerns?

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:43.940
Between 2010 and 2013, The Pew Research Centre polled 37 territories with significant Muslim populations

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.580
to gauge their opinions on these practices.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:52.400
These 37 territories account for
60% of the total global population of Muslims.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.580
Support for stoning adulterers ranged from
6% to 86%.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.800
Support for killing apostates ranged from
1% to 88%.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.360
Taking the average of these percentages alone

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.740
40% of Muslims wanted adulterers buried to their shoulders and pelted with rocks until they’re dead.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:16.300
And 31% wanted people killed for leaving Islam.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:22.320
Seeing this figure of 31% reminded me
of a BBC online report from the mid-2000s

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:27.840
also reporting 31% support for killing apostates
— this time among British Muslims.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:33.620
Support in the 16-34 age range
was especially high at up to 37%.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.880
More than one in three.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:40.100
Clearly, a majority of Muslims
don’t support these barbaric practices.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:45.280
But 99.9% is a daydream
from which we need to wake up.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.880
And if younger generations are showing
greater support for these practices

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.720
that could to a growing problem, not a shrinking one.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.020
Islam is not monolithic.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.240
Reportedly, Muhammad predicted
there would be 73 sects of Islam.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.340
In a claim not all Muslims accept, all but one
is said to be destined for hellfire.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.620
The main divide is between the Sunni and Shia branches,

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.240
which favour different successors to Muhammad.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.240
Both have given rise to subgroups

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.060
but while the Shia branch
recognises one school of Sharia

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:20.600
the Sunni branch recognises a handful of schools
favoured by different movements.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.560
The Ahmadi branch proclaims:
‘Love for all Hatred for none’.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.840
Ahmadi Muslims believe a messianic
reformer was born in the 1800s

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:35.760
sent ‘to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed
and reinstitute morality, justice and peace’.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:41.420
The Ahmadi community has been denounced
as non-Muslim and aggressively persecuted.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:46.020
In Pakistan, Ahmadi residents have reportedly
been required to disown their prophet

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.820
to obtain a Muslim passport

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.360
and hundreds from the community
have been murdered

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.540
in various mob attacks and full-scale massacres.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.600
The campaign of persecution
has followed them to the UK

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.620
including death threats, the targeted
boycotting of Ahmadi businesses

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:06.840
and even protests to block permission for an
Ahmadi mosque — all by other Muslim groups.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.860
Also worth a mention are the Sufis and the Quranists.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.160
Quranists reject the Hadith,
taking the Qur’an as their sole text.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.140
Reports of their persecution include
mass arrests in Sudan on charges of apostasy

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.880
where execution is threatened
for the wrong type of Islam.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:28.960
The Sufis are a mystical Islamic order, emphasising
inner experience, ritual and worship.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.860
Sufis have been accused
of idolatry and religious innovation

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:37.900
and their persecution has ranged from the banning
of devotional gatherings in Egypt

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.440
to the systematic destruction of
Sufi shrines in Timbuktu

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.680
to the murder of hundreds of Sufis in Pakistan.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.760
It’s plain to see, just as no Christian
speaks for all Christians

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.180
no Muslim speaks for all Muslims.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:56.880
It’s also tempting to fall into splitting again,
thinking of these groups as all good or all bad.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.320
Again, the truth is more complex.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.840
For example, while the Ahmadi community
proclaims ‘Love for all and hatred for none’

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.920
in its commentary on the Qur’an,
we find support for the idea that there can be

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:14.060
no true friendship between believers and disbelievers — an idea it claims has general application

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.820
as well as being specially true in times of war.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:22.240
The ReasonOnFaith website has also contrasted
regressive Ahmadi views on homosexuality

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.500
with the more welcoming views of groups like
Muslims for Progressive Values.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.400
But what’s abundantly clear in all this conflict

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.460
is that the people who suffer most
under Islam are Muslims.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:39.240
If we care about that suffering, we need to
acknowledge the part Islam plays in it.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:49.300
Ravi got in touch with me in 2013 to ask about
the meanings of certain phrases in my videos.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.620
He said he was atheist and wanted
to translate them for some people.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.100
I explained the phrases
and asked who he was sharing it with.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.100
He explained that he and
a small group of trusted friends

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.760
lived in a state where the penalty
for apostasy was death

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.660
— each of them pretending to be a Muslim in public life

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.340
while privately leading a secular existence.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.480
Ravi and his friends gathered
atheist materials from online sources

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.060
to discuss with each other and develop
their critical thinking skills.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.900
He said these forbidden materials were like
candles, illuminating the darkness around them

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:26.280
and giving them hope that one day they
might step out into the light.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.280
Ravi lives in constant fear of discovery.
And his fears are well-founded.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:38.920
In 2006, under Sharia, Afghan citizen Abdul Rahman
was sentenced to death for converting to Christianity.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.460
He was eventually granted asylum by Italy

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.420
after Afghan president Hamid Karzai became
caught between pressure from the West to release him

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.920
and pressure from the Afghan public to execute him.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.109
Rahman’s trial judge commented:
‘The Prophet Muhammad has said several times

00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:58.840
that those who convert from Islam should be
killed if they refuse to come back.’

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:05.040
He added: ‘Islam is a religion of peace,
tolerance, kindness and integrity.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:10.460
That is why we have told him
if he regrets what he did, then we will forgive him.’

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.540
So, this is the measure of peace:

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.460
‘Think what we tell you to think and we won’t kill you.’

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:21.560
Meriam Ibrahim was eight months pregnant
when she was sentenced to death

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.380
for refusing to renounce Christianity.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.000
She identified as a Christian,
following her mother’s religion.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.200
But with her father being a Muslim,
she was expected to take up his faith

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.840
Thanks to an Amnesty International
petition that gained more than a million signatures,

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:42.000
the Sudanese authorities released her,
exiling her and her family to the US.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.120
So. Are critics of Islam suffering from an
irrational fear called ‘Islamophobia’?

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.780
Or do they have a point?

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.140
Religious ideologies aren’t interchangeable.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:59.760
They promote vastly different ideas,
shaping human lives in vastly differently ways.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.060
What follows from that is that some religions will
attract more negative attention than others.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:11.240
Ideologies that degrade and dehumanise people,
that promote violence and threaten death,

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.980
should expect more criticism than ideologies that don’t.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.860
They’re not being ‘picked on’
for arbitrary, prejudicial reasons.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:22.820
They’re being held to account for the abuse they inspire.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.960
Religious ideas are not untouchable.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:31.540
They deserve no privilege. On the contrary, they
deserve rigorous and long-overdue criticism

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.840
to catch up on centuries of silencing criticism

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:39.900
through shunning, imprisonment, censorship and killing.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.780
I don’t measure an ideology’s peacefulness by 
its willingness not to kill people

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.820
so long as they surrender to it.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:52.340
The implicit threat behind that idea
destroys any pretence of peacefulness.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.220
People come first.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.640
And when ideas threaten people,
it only provides further support

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.260
for the essential human activity of attacking ideas.
