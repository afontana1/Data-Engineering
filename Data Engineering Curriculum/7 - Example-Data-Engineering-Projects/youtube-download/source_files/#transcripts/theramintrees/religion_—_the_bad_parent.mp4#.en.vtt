00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:04.690
[music]

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.689
Going into work one morning, on the 9.15 to Charing Cross,

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.570
my private train of thought was derailed when a man suddenly started shouting.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.820
When I looked up, I realised&nbsp;I'd clocked him earlier, when he got on. I'd seen him push his way

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.929
to the middle of the compartment with unusual purpose.&nbsp;He'd now whipped out a bible

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.069
and was shouting out passages from it. This kind of thing's a very rare event in the UK

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.579
And the passengers' reactions

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.460
 make it clear why. After a few seconds, someone told him to shut up.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.420
He carried on.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.700
They told him to shut up again, and someone else told him to save it for church.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.770
In response, his voice went up a pitch.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.739
Then other people started joining in, shouting him down,

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.150
telling him to take it somewhere else, this wasn't the place for that stuff.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.470
But he carried on,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.150
eventually ditching his bible and just commanding us to get on our knees before

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.850
his god, or we'd burn in hell forever.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.690
But the passengers just got louder,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.580
until they completely drowned him out.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.289
He fizzled to a stop,

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.269
and the crowd died down to a kind of irritated murmur.&nbsp;It was quite something

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.530
to witness their anger.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.930
When the train stopped at Charing Cross, the preacher went and stood to one side

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.700
of the platform&nbsp;away from the flow of commuters. He looked shell-shocked,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.590
and seemed to start talking to himself.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.450
I walked slowly past him.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.360
He was quietly praying to his god to dispel the demons that had possessed us to reject

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.609
his divine word.

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.040
The fact that many of the commuters were christian seemed to elude him completely.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.000
If there was one image that encapsulated the root of all the problems I have with religion,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.950
for me this would be it.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.000
It's the Parent-Child psychological relationship.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.970
As explained in previous videos in the series, these terms don't refer literally

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.510
to parents and children but to styles of thinking, feeling, and relating to others.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.930
We can take a Parental approach to others, using behaviours learned from authority figures

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.299
in our life.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.219
We can think, feel and relate to others like we did in our childhood.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.780
Or, in Adult mode, we can be spontaneous, aware,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.110
and in the moment.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.320
In this video I'll be exploring how

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.860
Parent-Child dynamics pervade and underpin unhealthy, retrograde concepts

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.789
and practice,

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.080
and looking at equitable alternatives.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.229
The very idea of 'faith',&nbsp;in a religious context,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.499
carries the intrinsic notion of yielding to human authority.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:17.269
To allow the anomalous class of 'supernatural' entities into our belief system,

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.430
we have to accept another human's hearsay as reality.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.379
With the proposed entities inaccessible to our senses, there is no other mechanism.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.919
Of course, if they were accessible&nbsp;to our senses it would also, by definition,

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.109
no longer be a matter of faith to believe they existed.

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.689
Some folks still point to holy books as evidence. But books describing supernatural events,

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.219
creatures and processes

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.729
for which there's again no evidence, amount to the same thing: hearsay

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:47.749
It's no accident that hearsay's not admissible as evidence in court.

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.979
People misremember details, people unwittingly repeat lies they've been told,

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.010
or deliberately lie, for various reasons.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.520
Above all, people give conflicting accounts.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.840
As adults we know these flaws make hearsay an absolutely unworkable basis

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.879
for the determination of reality.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.339
But when it comes to religion, many suspend all of this awareness,

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:10.499
even though every single problem here can be clearly observed in religious contexts,

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:14.209
especially the problem of conflicting accounts, with conflicts not only

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.779
between religions, but also within them. Why is awareness suspended around religious hearsay?

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.130
It's no coincidence that religious indoctrination tends to take place in childhood,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.260
when not only are critical faculties not yet developed,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.870
but egocentricity's at an all-time high --&nbsp;consistent with the message that

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.449
'it was all put here for us'.

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.279
The honourable thing to do would be to respect the child's impressionable brain by giving it facts.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.930
If you're going to teach the child about religion, teach it about all religions

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.480
without bias, preserve all the inconsistencies without excuse or rationalisation,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.200
and make it clear that these are beliefs, not facts.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.980
Of course what we tend to see is very different, with distinctive patterns of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.449
coercion and reinforcement, rewarding expressions of belief,

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.539
and discouraging and punishing awkward questions and non-participation.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.730
Beliefs are taught as fact, inconsistencies are denied,

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.629
and other religions are dismissed or even demonised -- if indeed they ever

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.600
get mentioned.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.040
One of several iconic terms to emerge from George Orwell's novel 1984

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.189
was 'doublethink'.

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.389
It referred to the acceptance of two conflicting ideas,

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.809
in contrast to cognitive dissonance, where the conflicting ideas arouse

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:21.780
conscious tension.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.729
An example of doublethink in the novel was where workers, who were ordered to falsify public records,

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.160
would then believe their own forgery.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.560
There's more than a whiff of doublethink about the parent who employs all these

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.479
manipulations on their child, then claims it was free to believe what it liked.

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.710
But then we see examples of doublethink everywhere in religion.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.630
We see popes, who've enjoyed the shelter of backdated papal infallibility since 1870,

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.030
despite contradictory stances on a broad range of subjects.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.320
We see claims of eternal moral values, despite the assertion of diametrically opposed

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.560
moral positions.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.930
We see psychopathic behaviour like genocide and perpetual torture exhibited

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.669
by beings characterised as supremely loving.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.099
Unfortunately, with the child's critical faculties initially absent, then actively suppressed,

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.459
the seeds for doublethink are off to a great start.

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:14.179
Of course children aren't the only targets for proselytisation. Returning to the

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:18.489
preacher on the train, we see the same Parent-Child psychological relationship

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:22.109
attempted on adults. Of course when it comes to dogma, your strategies are limited.

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.699
The foundation for dogma is authority, and a respectful, equal Adult exchange is out of the question.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.790
Hence we see the preacher talking down to adults like school children.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.530
The trouble is, to get compliance, the target has to accept the instigator as

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.160
a legitimate authority. What the preacher failed to grasp is that we're none too likely

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.229
to accept some belligerent stranger as an authority.

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.389
Ironically, he did succeed in getting Child responses -- just not the compliant Child

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.779
he hoped for. Rebellious Child responses are easily aroused by this kind of

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.870
bumbling grab for authority,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.139
resulting in scorn and insults.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.099
His severe breach of socially appropriate boundaries also predictably

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.999
elicits Parent responses, bringing the offender back into line.

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:08.019
The preacher's command to get down on our knees brings up another

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:10.309
Parent-Child transaction: worship.

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:13.879
Some folks have a hard time imagining a worship-free life. Hence the

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:18.099
misapprehension that atheists must be worshipping something, probably themselves.

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.340
Leaving aside the trouble of worshipping things whose existence can't even

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.669
be demonstrated .... There's a fatal flaw in the whole notion of worship. Nothing needs

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.090
to be worshipped.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.550
In fact these days, we're realising that the kind of stupendous egotism

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.050
that requires genuine worship is by and large driven by crippling inadequacy.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.290
This leaves worshippers in a strangely redundant position -- fulfilling

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.560
a need that simply doesn't exist. But still some persist, claiming the

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.210
act of worship benefits us, not gods. They say it makes us appreciate our good fortunes.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.030
But worship isn't necessary for that either.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.729
I can sit here and consider my good fortunes without any thought or action

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.340
remotely resembling worship.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.190
Then of course the judgements come.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.220
Declining to humble myself is taken as arrogance.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.130
But this highlights a false dichotomy, missing a balanced middle ground where we

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.419
neither have to inflate ourselves nor reduce ourselves. The adult ground

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.579
where we're actually good enough as we are.

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:15.029
The preacher's ability to rationalise away his own shortcomings by demonising the commuters,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.080
highlights a peculiar strategy for evading personal responsibility.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.270
Christian A regularly sermonises against various social groups with hideously

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.349
sweeping statements about their immorality. But then one day, His own morality gets

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:31.690
called into question, through some personal transgression.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.720
Maybe the embezzlement of charity funds, or revelations of links to escort services.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.680
He tries to cover up.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.449
Christian B comes forward -- she confirms his transgression and encourages him to come clean.

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:46.050
Christian A now attempts to assert that, by exposing him, she's damaged his ability

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.089
to spread god's word.

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:51.839
He actually rationalises his own transgression into an accusation that

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.080
Christian B has acted against their god.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.810
So the line 'It's not me you're against, it's god' is used to avoid responsibility

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.979
for personal failure and transgression.

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:04.879
But it's also used by some who claim to speak directly for their god, pumping up

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:09.269
their own Parent authority to divine levels.&nbsp;It's particularly useful when

00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:11.239
the goal is anti-social in nature.

00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:15.109
When it becomes a matter of human judgement —&nbsp;the case is lost. These three positions

00:08:15.109 --> 00:08:18.879
are bound to lose in rational argument because they all hinge on prejudice.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:22.819
Like dogma, irrational prejudice relies on authority.

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:26.740
The Parent-Child psychological elationship can be a positive environment.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.909
The&nbsp;parent's controlling side can provide crucial information about

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.210
appropriate boundaries,

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.450
allowing the child to integrate and function socially with others.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.180
The parent's nurturing side comforts and encourages the child, assisting its

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.130
emotional and intellectual development and independence.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.710
And that's the crucial point here: independence.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.770
The child becomes an adult. The parent is preparing the child for

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.150
this important transition.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.740
To seek to keep someone in a persistent infantilised state

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.070
is to thwart that natural development.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.220
When I announced my atheism as a child, there were tensions for a while.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.459
Those around me took the ignorant view that many theists take towards atheists.

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:06.620
They mistook my position for a Rebellious Child position.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.760
It took time but eventually it sank in that I was coming from a rational position,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.310
and the dynamic shifted.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.770
And in adult life, in the UK, religion's been a non-issue. Why?

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.290
Well, over here, pushing your religion on others has generally been considered

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.220
quite crass and vulgar.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.339
Religion's been a predominantly private, personal matter --&nbsp;with an inward focus, on one's own beliefs.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.120
With the expansionist fundamentalist theists I've experienced online in the last 3 years,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.860
the focus is firmly outward —&nbsp;everyone else must change to fit in with them.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.180
The behaviour I've witnessed has been aggressive, intolerant and judgemental.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.800
The fact that the behaviour's so extreme that it totally negates the religion

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.310
it claims to promote, is no big surprise --

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.780
just more doublethink. What's interesting to me though is that we see exactly

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.400
the same processes I witnessed with the train preacher. We see the fundamentalists' same disregard for

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.439
others with different beliefs --

00:09:57.439 --> 00:09:59.540
and even sometimes those with the same beliefs.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.600
We see the same controlling, condemning Parent attitude. We see the same predictable

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.800
reactions against such arrogance.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.509
We see the same rationalisations from fundamentalists that it's not them

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:13.089
that people are reacting against, but their god.

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:16.869
We see the same increase in pitch and escalation of tactics to establish dominion --

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:21.580
although, unlike the preacher, this time it's not just a case of talking louder.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.669
We see the rise of faith schools,

00:10:23.669 --> 00:10:27.999
where pseudo-teachers teach pseudo-biology, then proudly announce that

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:32.390
100% of their students have rejected scientific fact for creationist myths.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.950
We see horrendous, abusive religious camps run by power-hungry demagogues

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.829
who see children as pawns in a religious arms race.

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:41.929
Who describe children as 'useable'.

00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:45.410
Who openly admit they want to see children laying down their lives

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.950
for their religion.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.410
And we see the nauseating results, as the children's minds are sullied with

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.650
their vile prejudices.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.100
We see the burning of flags and books -- attempting to push others into a fearful, compliant

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.790
Child position, but just like the train preacher's inept fear-mongering,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.810
provoking rebellion and anger instead.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.320
Spot the theme?

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.850
It's of course the way of things that those who feel entitled to privileges don't surrender them easily.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.430
Luxury becomes necessity, and the prospect of introducing an equitable balance

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.610
can leave those who've taken more than their fair share of power feeling

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.380
somehow deprived.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.460
With every single reclamation of equal rights in history, we've seen the

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.139
campaign of resistance that's swelled up in reaction.

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:30.110
Attempts to characterise the rebelling underclass as a sickness, a virus to be squashed.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.280
We see them cast as uncompromising and&nbsp;militaristic. These characteristics are

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.620
currently being attributed to atheists, with&nbsp;the oxymoronic term

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.470
'fundamentalist atheism'.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:46.080
But systems of oppression can't be maintained. People might start out submitting to abuse,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.890
if that's all they've known.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.550
But it's in our nature to grow.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.579
The child grows and the social group grows.

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.920
With increasing experience

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.339
comes the creeping awareness that this abuse is not the inevitable order of things --

00:11:57.339 --> 00:12:01.779
that indefensible inequities have been perpetrated on them. And that the power

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.099
they've given away

00:12:03.099 --> 00:12:04.470
can be taken back.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.899
If we're to grow up as a species,

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:10.010
we need to address the systems that infantilise us.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.320
Not just religious infantilising systems, but infantilising social systems

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.009
that perpetuate prejudice and discrimination,

00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:19.009
and infantilising governments --

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:23.319
by which I don't just mean obvious dictatorships, but also the sly, insidious

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:27.439
Parental states who encourage us to surrender successive freedoms,

00:12:27.439 --> 00:12:31.919
on the false pretext of increasing security against fears they themselves promote.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.659
Life is chockfull of uncertainties,

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:37.770
ambiguities, insecurities.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.819
Dealing with that by submitting to Parent-Child systems

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:42.500
is moving backwards,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:48.160
not forwards. I un-humbly submit that we're better off neither inflated nor diminished,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.430
but standing tall, at our full Adult height.
