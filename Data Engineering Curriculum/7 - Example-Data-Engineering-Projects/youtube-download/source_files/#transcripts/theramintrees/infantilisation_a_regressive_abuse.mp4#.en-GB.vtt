00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.340
There are lots of positives to being a child.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.820
One of those positives underpins the TheraminTrees
channel icon.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.940
The image of a floating foetus in adult clothes

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.040
— originally a tuxedo —

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.500
came from a dream in my teens.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.039
For me, what came through in the image

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.360
was the idea of preserving the fresh unjaded
eyes we possess at birth.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.300
For a brief time, our curiosity about the
world

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.969
is un-cluttered by dogma and tribalism.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.520
Our minds haven’t yet been colonised

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.410
by any partisan prejudices from the communities

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.970
into which we’re randomly born.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.890
We don’t see the bogus social divisions
constructed by certain groups

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.170
and attributed with spurious meaning.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.280
When their assertions don’t make sense

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.180
we question them unselfconsciously.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.999
When the answers are inadequate

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.100
we say so without inhibition.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.000
This kind of sincere reality testing offers
us the most solid foundation

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.600
for acquiring skills, knowledge and understanding.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.580
Not solid in terms of rigidity and inflexibility.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.500
As a species we seem repeatedly to learn and
forget, re-learn and re-forget

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.280
that fixed dogmatic mindsets lead us down
disastrous pathways.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.380
Solid in terms of resourcefulness.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.719
Instead of clinging to a bogus idea

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.120
so that when it sinks, we sink with it

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.720
we’re able to adapt

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.540
—&nbsp;to recognise its bogus nature and step
away into new insight.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.799
The child-like instinct to question freely

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.180
is a precious strength worth preserving.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.219
But instead of nurturing this and other strengths

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.729
many individuals and groups try to preserve
the child’s vulnerabilities

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.280
to meet various psychological
needs of their own.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.940
The child might be seen as a blank canvas

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.120
to be filled with all the unexamined tribal
superstitions

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.880
and traditions of previous generations and
charged

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.960
with passing them on wholesale to the next.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.900
The child might be groomed as an enabler

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.220
trained to affirm and support the comforting
illusions of egotists.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.340
The child might be idealised by individuals
and groups who venerate innocence

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.780
and view worldly knowledge and experience

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.800
as contaminants to what they see as a perfect
untouched state.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.560
The child gets depersonalised into a slave,
a pet, a toy, an ornament.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.609
Instead of being encouraged and celebrated

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.560
the child’s development is actively sabotaged

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.720
in an attempt to preserve the most vulnerable
qualities of infanthood:

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.019
ignorance, inexperience, incompetence, dependence.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.860
The growing individual becomes infantilised.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.280
Infantilisation is an extremely common manipulation

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.719
in which individuals are treated in ways

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.340
that deny their maturity or mental capacity.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.120
It’s also one of the most slippery forms
of manipulation.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.660
Unlike more overtly abusive tactics

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.500
it’s often disguised as other things,
like affection.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.780
Infantilising abusers claim their babying
behaviour is an expression of love.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.840
But it’s not love.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.120
It’s a cage that gets progressively more
confining.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.840
As their world shrinks

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.020
targets of infantilisation feel increasingly
confined and immobilised.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.340
They anticipate failing, and not being able
to cope.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.040
I want to explore this manipulative tactic

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.780
and some of its insidious features.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.760
I’ll be using real-life examples, mainly
from families and religion.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.340
But it can happen wherever power dynamics exist:

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.040
abusive one-to-one relationships, politics,
education, the workplace.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.140
And I invite you to notice any personal parallels
in your own experience.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.380
Our first experience of one-up one-down relationships

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.800
are the ones we’re born into.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.540
We enter the world powerless

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.720
into the care of people who hold all the power.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.720
People we call family.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.620
For that first vulnerable part of our lives

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.480
they govern every aspect of our existence

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.580
from our appearance to the food we eat to
the company we keep.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.580
Fathers and mothers are kings and queens

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.680
exercising all-encompassing sovereignty.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.560
Older siblings, next in line to the throne

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.380
also hold significant influence.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.060
In healthy families, this monarchy is benevolent
and fleeting.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.440
Parents recognise they’re the temporary
guardians of their offspring

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.700
not their owners or their eternal rulers.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.319
Their absolute power doesn’t corrupt absolutely.

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.281
It’s channelled positively into helping
the child

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:24.260
develop into a self-sufficient, independent
individual.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.340
And as the child acquires knowledge and experience

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.900
the one-up one-down relationship resolves
into an equal adult relationship.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.520
Parents remain parents in name

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.120
and bonds of love and affection continue.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.300
But the functional role of ‘parenting’
ceases.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.800
All parties are self-directing now, free of
any role-based remnants.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.840
When you come from a positive family environment
like that

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.979
it’s sometimes hard to conceive of the countless
families

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.480
where parents become perpetual dictators,
lazy with power;

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.880
where roles are malignantly distorted and
children are used

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.240
to satisfy unmet needs and fantasies and act
out unresolved issues.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.780
Adultification happens when the child is prematurely
assigned

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.800
adult roles and responsibilities they’re
not ready for.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.360
Spousification puts the child
in a quasi-partner role

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.640
opening the door to emotional
if not physical incest.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.800
Parentification describes a role reversal

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.780
in which the child is expected to look after
the parent.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.780
Like all of these corruptions of the parental role

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.880
infantilisation stems from a refusal

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.600
to acknowledge the child as a fully separate
person.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.120
Infantilisation is an assault from multiple
directions.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.780
It manifests in a variety of ways

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.240
each one intended to erode some aspect of
the individual

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.080
that confers mature status.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.940
One example is a refusal to acknowledge age-appropriate boundaries.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.140
Despite 8-year-old Dominic’s repeated suggestions

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.200
that he’s old enough to bathe himself

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.060
his father continues to bathe him.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.660
Finally Dominic takes the initiative and bathes
himself.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.600
Finding the bathroom door locked, his father
is furious

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.470
and says if Dominic doesn’t need his help
bathing

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.849
he won’t get any more help with anything.

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:23.980
Dominic is subjected to a lengthy silent treatment.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.640
This real-life example illustrates the no-win
scenario that plays out

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.860
in infantalising families, ideological groups,
and workplaces.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.440
Targets start from an undermined position.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.420
If they ask permission to advance,
it’s denied.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.100
If they dare to take matters into their own
hands

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.600
and demonstrate their competence,
they're punished.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.380
All roads point back to square one.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.600
In healthy families, parents respect and foster

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.360
their children’s emerging desire for independence
and privacy.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.420
Punishing children for exercising these important
boundaries

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.280
can create lasting conflicted impulses

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.820
where privacy and independence become associated
with guilt and anxiety.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.100
35-year-old Karen is publicly scolded at a
family wedding

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.319
when her mother discovers a small dove

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.360
discreetly tattooed on her back.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.380
Instead of asking about the deeply personal
symbolism

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.920
and learning something about Karen’s life

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.640
her mother takes it as evidence of juvenile
rebelliousness.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.320
30-year-old Isolde’s father constantly recommends
weight loss programs

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.800
and always prescribes low-calorie food for her

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.200
when they eat together in private or public.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.340
When she tactfully tries to sidestep his interference

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.620
he pushes the point until things get tense.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.390
It’s as if Karen and Isolde don’t own
their own bodies.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.380
They’re just renting them from their parental
landlords

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.580
who expect their property to be maintained
to their specification.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.100
Because of their delusion of ownership

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.700
they misinterpret their daughters’ exercise
of bodily autonomy

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.280
as acts of personal rebellion against them.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.640
Infantilising parents break all kinds of boundaries.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.100
They decide who their offspring can be friends with.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.720
They turn up at workplaces, making scenes.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.200
They assume charge of their grandchildren
without consultation.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.100
Honouring boundaries is one of the most basic
expressions

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.420
of respect we show other people.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.020
It demonstrates that we recognise their fundamental
governance

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.340
over their own existence.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.180
And it’s for that reason that crossing boundaries
without invitation

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.400
is reserved for very specific circumstances

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.240
for example when people are incapable of caring
for themselves

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.400
or where there’s a threat of harm.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.080
And even in those cases, situations are assessed

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.660
to make sure that crossing boundaries
is genuinely justified.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.060
When boundaries are casually ignored

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.040
it’s an act of disrespect and dominance.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.120
The building — and maintenance — of solid
boundaries

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.920
is one of the most crucial and one of the
most difficult

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.660
aspects of overcoming infantilisation.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.280
Later on I’ll be looking at what that involves

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.580
including some traps to avoid.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.480
Dominic’s bath time experience illustrates
another aspect of infantilisation:

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.860
the persistent withholding of credit.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:34.320
Targets’ knowledge, experience and skills
are habitually dismissed.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.200
The assumption is they can’t do anything.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.920
At her 30th birthday party organised by her aunt

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.190
Ingrid says she wants to take a group photo.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.200
Her father orders her to give him the camera

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.600
— she’s bound to do it wrong.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.280
Later, when she begins to cut her birthday cake

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.560
her father snatches the knife and takes over

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.300
telling her what a mess she’s making.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.150
Whatever she tries to do

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.820
—&nbsp;open some champagne, put some music on,
organise games —

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.580
he swoops in and stops her.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.220
Many targets of infantilisation are subjected

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.460
to relentless debilitating micromanagement.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.920
The expected outcome is always failure.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.000
And that expectation is used to prevent the
target from trying.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.400
It’s a circular self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.200
Preventing targets from trying prevents them
from learning

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.340
which will tend to produce failure,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.560
which is then used to justify preventing the target trying.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.320
Ironically, Ingrid is a far more capable

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.820
and accomplished person than her father.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.940
But like many targets, she’s had to acquire
all her skills and experience

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.020
elsewhere away from her abuser.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.060
Her capabilities go unrecognised.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.540
And on the rare times she demonstrates her
proficiency

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.380
it’s dismissed as a fluke.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.060
In the same way, the extensive talents of
people

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.170
in infantilising religious and political groups

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.840
go untapped because their ideology considers
them

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.640
a subordinate class of human being.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.880
They’re denied leadership roles and positions
on judging panels

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.980
and confined to menial tasks.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:21.720
It’s not an unrelated fact that those groups
are often run by incompetent twits.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.180
Sometimes, the withholding of credit is falsely
wrapped up as concern.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.100
In his mid-20s, Nikolai flies out to a holiday
resort

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.060
to meet his parents for a vacation.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.180
On his first morning he says he’s going
for a swim in the sea.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.200
His mother descends into histrionics

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.230
insisting his father chaperones the strong
swimmer in case he drowns.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:51.080
Eventually, to placate her, the two men walk
down to the beach

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.630
where Nikolai has a joyless swim

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.840
conscious of his father’s resentment — and
his own.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.160
It’s a grindingly familiar experience.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.950
Nikolai’s mother justifies her constant
demeaning interventions

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.600
with an air of maternal martyrdom

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.460
claiming ‘I can’t help fussing. I’m
a mother!’

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.160
But while she endlessly fusses, she never
actually helps.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.000
In fact she’s been conspicuously out of
sync

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.760
with Nikolai’s needs ever since he was born.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.720
As he’ll eventually discover, she has a
malignant personality disorder

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.080
and never felt anything approaching maternal
love.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.480
Which is why her so-called assistance only
ever created problems;

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.700
and why whenever real help was needed

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.100
she always made excuses and a swift exit.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.940
Her bouts of infantilising fussing were just
cartoonish performances

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.960
of what she thought maternal love looked like.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.820
Aside from trying to extract affirmation for
herself for being a doting mother

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.700
these performances highlight another element
of infantilisation

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.740
found in many areas of abuse.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.160
Targets are trained to fear the outside world.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.520
Members of religious organisations are warned

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.400
that the world is in the grip of evil supernatural
entities.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.840
Political ideologues are taught to view non-members

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.300
as either malevolent or enablers of malevolence.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.000
Citizens are whipped into divisive paranoia
by corrupt governments.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.540
Instilling fear is designed to draw targets
close

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.680
with the message ‘I’ll keep you safe’;

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.190
to encourage the voluntary surrender of freedoms

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.950
and discourage targets from exploring a world

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:41.180
they might find complex, beautiful and engaging.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.720
As a result, members of religious and political
groups

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.860
cloister themselves in likeminded bubbles

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.240
blocking and shunning dissenting opinions.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.220
Citizens offer limitless personal data to
governments and corporate giants

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.700
with child-like trust, believing their best
interests will be served.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.540
And children grow up having never known an
unsupervised moment

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.550
or been allowed to develop age-appropriate
self-management skills

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.190
including the ability to deal with conflict

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:19.300
without appealing to external authorities
to intervene and dispense justice.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.220
The persistent diminishing nature of infantilisation

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.960
distinguishes it from authentic protectiveness
and concern.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.300
Healthy parents don’t diminish their offspring.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.960
Healthy partners don’t diminish their mates.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.080
They don’t use their loved ones’ failures
to shame them

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.400
or disqualify them from further attempts.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.660
They understand that working through failure
is how we develop.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.560
Healthy groups don’t restrict contact with
non-members.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.880
They understand that other perspectives

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.980
—&nbsp;including critical perspectives —

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.140
can, like failure, be an important source
of growth.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.540
The abusive nature of infantilising protectiveness

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.620
also reveals itself in the actions taken

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.860
against people who try to opt out of it.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:14.540
Responses of emotional blackmail, smear campaigns,
shunning, silencing, even threats of violence

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.820
make it clear who targets really needed to
protect themselves from.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.960
Another infantilising tactic that masquerades

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.560
as something positive is perpetual wallowing
in an idealised past.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.040
Whenever 36-year old Ty speaks with his mother

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.040
she embarks on the same long-winded script.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.540
In a bedtime story voice,
she rehashes vaseline-lensed memories

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.840
she’s recounted hundreds of times about
his early childhood.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.460
The stories are littered with the same one-liners:

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.820
‘Why did you have to grow up?’

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.820
‘You’ll always be my little baby.’

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.460
Ty recalls none of these old memories

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.540
and hearing them endlessly repeated

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.300
leaves him feeling disconnected and claustrophobic.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.110
It’s as if his life stopped when he was
three years old

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.320
at the start of what his mother calls his
‘difficult years’

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.880
ie when he began developing an independent
personality.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.140
They were certainly difficult for Ty

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.840
whose growing independence was met

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.720
with rages, silence treatments and exclusion

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.750
including being banished
from the house for hours

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.760
and left to roam the streets.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.840
Decades later, still unwilling to acknowledge
her son

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.980
as an independent person,
she continues to try

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.620
and drag him back to those first three years

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.460
when she felt like the centre of his universe.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.380
Many abusers repeatedly hark back to a few
scant good times

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.780
to try and block out the years of abuse that
truly characterise the relationship

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.360
and immerse the target in a haze of artificial
wistfulness.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.380
A sober assessment of just how few good times
there actually were

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.580
will give a fair indication of just how few
good times there are to come.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.140
With infantilisation, memories of helplessness
and vulnerability

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:13.520
are specifically selected to put the target
back in that psychological state.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.140
Another common strand of infantilisation

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.580
is that the target’s sexuality is denied
or obstructed.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.600
When Leo and his partner are invited

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.980
to spend the weekend at his parents’ house

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.420
his father tells him they’ll have to sleep
separately.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.640
No other couples get treated this way.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.080
Sleeping arrangements during family visits
are a battleground for many folks.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.060
Adults are treated like unruly adolescents

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.600
and barred from sleeping with their own partners.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.260
Controlling religious and pseudoscience groups

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.000
often try to impede or eliminate sexuality
among their members.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.680
Masturbation is frequently forbidden.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.940
Leaders of groups like the Jehovah’s Witnesses
and the Mormons

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.740
have presumed to dictate to married couples

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.340
what kinds of sex they can and can’t have.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.019
These invasions are designed to teach targets

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:08.000
that even in the most private aspects

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.620
of their relationships and their bodies

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.660
they remain under royal rulership.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.900
In working with clients like Leo

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.870
who’ve experienced parental intrusion on
their sexuality,

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.620
I’ve presented the following hypothetical.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.400
Imagine that whenever you visit your parents

00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:29.480
before you’re allowed to enter, you and
your partner

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.340
have to consent to them slapping you both
round the face.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.320
How likely would you be to visit them?

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.300
Invariably the answer is: not very likely.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.920
The next question is:

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.000
How does that differ from what your parents
are already doing?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.520
Parents who insist on separate beds for their
offspring and partners

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.400
are telling them their relationship is invalid;

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.820
that there’s something unacceptable about it

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.220
that disqualifies it from respect.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.700
When offspring submit to these intrusions

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.100
they’re tacitly validating their own invalidation.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.720
They’re allowing themselves and their partners

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.640
to be slapped round the face.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.009
It’ll always be up to offspring&nbsp;and their
partners

00:20:16.009 --> 00:20:18.850
to decide what intrusions they’re prepared
to tolerate

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.740
from their parents and partner’s parents.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.140
Just as employees have to decide what intrusions

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.400
they tolerate from their employers;

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.820
citizens from their governments;

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.160
religious followers from their religious leaders.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.900
But the consequences of giving in to invalidating
power plays

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.400
are not to be underestimated.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.179
When we act like submissive children

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.700
our emotions and thoughts follow.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.880
We feel and think like submissive children.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.740
We regress to a meek one-down
permission-seeking position

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:57.080
hoping for respect rather than expecting it.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.120
As we become smaller, we become more vulnerable
to further encroachment.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.940
Likewise, when we respond as adults

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.700
we feel and think like adults.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.180
We operate from an equal position

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.860
and we’re clear  about the respect
we’re entitled to from loved ones.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.500
Prior to his visit, Leo gave his father

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.500
some chances to reconsider his position.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:27.520
Three times he stated he and his partner would
expect to sleep together.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.700
After his father’s third rejection of the idea

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.160
Leo informed him they wouldn’t be visiting.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.560
When Leo’s resolve became clear

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.720
his father had a rethink and accepted his terms.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.100
Leo avoided some common traps
targets fall into

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.860
when they’re building boundaries
with infantilising people.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.680
One trap is to try to argue their case with
the infantilising individual

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.280
or explain why they deserve respect.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.660
It’s not up to targets to come up with reasons

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.180
why they should be treated with basic consideration.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.700
A variation of this trap is bargaining for respect.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.420
Some targets try offering some concession
or compromise

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.280
to gain basic consideration.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.639
But that just keeps them in a one-down position

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.840
giving respect freely but paying for the respect
they receive.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.360
Another trap is bluffing.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.500
When targets lay out what’ll happen if they’re
mistreated

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.500
they need to be prepared to follow through
with those consequences.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.720
To be taken seriously, targets need
to be serious.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.400
A final trap worth mentioning is losing control.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.240
Frustrating as it is to be infantilised

00:22:42.249 --> 00:22:45.450
lashing out just lives down to expectations

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:50.460
and feeds into the child-like image that’s
already being peddled.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.760
Anger is an extremely useful emotional fuel

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.920
when it’s harnessed and focussed.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.800
And for many targets it plays a huge part
in ending their abuse.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.620
It can galvanise us; sustain our determination.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.560
There’s even evidence it can sharpen our
information-processing skills.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.720
In their 2007 paper ‘Thinking straight while
seeing red’

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.120
Wesley Moons and Diane Mackie found that angry
individuals

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.040
were more likely to discriminate between weak
and strong arguments

00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:23.659
than individuals in neutral moods

00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:27.039
and that anger encouraged analytical processing

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.020
even in individuals who didn’t have strong
analytical predispositions.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.559
But when anger runs wild

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:38.960
its constructive potential collapses into
destructive potential

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.300
which can backfire on the target.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:46.280
All these traps spring from
the same basic mistake.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.020
Targets are over-valuing their abusers’ respect.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.540
By chasing their respect, they give their
abusers a hold over them.

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:58.639
When targets turn their focus inward on their
own self-respect

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:01.049
there’s often a natural shift.

00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:04.389
They stop behaving like second-class citizens

00:24:04.389 --> 00:24:08.540
and start occupying their full adult space.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.280
In milder cases where there’s no deep pathology

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.860
a bit of sustained adult resistance
can sometimes shake

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.940
infantilising individuals out of their misguided
behaviour

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.080
—&nbsp;although it’s worth preparing for some
subsequent backsliding

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.580
and doubling down in some cases.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.210
But at the malignant end, where individuals
and groups

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.960
are entrenched in deeply disordered
power fantasies

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.419
it’s time to think about creating serious
personal distance

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.840
— reducing or terminating contact.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.580
In many religions 
—&nbsp;certainly the Abrahamic ones —

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:56.820
infantilisation is intrinsically woven into
the central divine concept.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.240
The god character described in scriptural
creation myths

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.879
designs an immeasurably inferior species called
human beings

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.900
who are prevented from ever attaining

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.780
the god’s knowledge, skills or understanding.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.280
Humans are kept in deliberate ignorance

00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:17.070
and obliged to obey without comprehension.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:21.509
The Biblical creation myth frames this diminished
infantilised state

00:25:21.509 --> 00:25:26.060
as perfection, purity, innocence.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:30.920
This innocent state is venerated as the pinnacle
of human existence.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.740
That innocence is then despicably abused.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.240
In the creation myth, the god character makes
a garden paradise called Eden

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.100
and creates the first man,
Adam, to look after it.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.620
He then creates the first woman, Eve, to be
Adam’s helper.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.740
The pair of them are left to wander round
the garden

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.620
where they’re allowed to eat the fruit of
any tree.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.300
With a bizarre exception.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.500
The god character chooses the garden of Eden

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.540
as the location for two magic trees:

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.920
the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

00:26:05.929 --> 00:26:09.350
He directs Adam and Eve not to eat from the
second of these

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.300
warning them they’ll die when they do.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.680
But everything’s okay.
He’s created them innocent

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.380
— ie, ignorant, inexperienced and obedient.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.980
What could go wrong?

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.420
Well, just about everything.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:29.220
A talking serpent, described variously as
subtle, crafty and cunning

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.380
tells the innocent Eve she won’t die if
she eats the fruit.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.780
Instead, she’ll become wise
like the god character.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.980
She eats — and persuades Adam to eat.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:46.460
And true to the serpent’s word, they don’t
die&nbsp;and they gain wisdom.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:51.420
As a sign of their lost innocence, they dress
themselves in leaves.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.519
The god character then punishes them for disobedience

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:58.590
casting them from Eden before they can eat
the fruit of the other magic tree

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:03.280
— the tree of life, which would give them
immortality.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.220
This creation myth illustrates why innocence
is not something to be venerated.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.700
Adam and Eve were presented with conflicting
statements

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.180
which they weren’t equipped to process.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.120
When the serpent said they wouldn’t die

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.560
he meant the mere act of eating the fruit
wouldn’t instantly kill them.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.840
When the god character said they’d die when
they ate from the tree

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.480
he meant he would personally enforce their
eventual death.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.880
In fact it was his deliberately misleading
phrasing

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.040
that caused the whole problem.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.710
We can safely call it deliberately misleading

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.940
because, being an all-knowing deity,
he would’ve known

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.900
how Adam and Eve would misinterpret it.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.259
He would’ve known that if he’d simply
told them

00:27:45.259 --> 00:27:47.429
he would cast them out and let them die

00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:50.680
the serpent’s statement wouldn’t’ve
conflicted with his.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.760
And of course he knew they had no capacity

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.480
to process the conflicting information they
were given.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.780
They were punished for failing a test they
were designed to fail.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.260
The failure lies completely with the god character.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.340
If he wanted to preserve human innocence

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.640
it was his job to create an environment

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.540
where it would never be jeopardised.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.460
In Biblical mythology, the omnipotent, omniscient
god character

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.100
was perfectly capable of creating that environment

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.300
if he’d really wanted to.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.400
Having just created an entire universe

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.140
he could’ve placed his magic trees out of
reach on some distant planet.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:36.260
In fact there’s no explanation for why they
even had to exist.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.020
He could’ve made humans unable to communicate
with anyone but him.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.370
If he wanted to preserve their ignorance

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.460
he could’ve created them without curiosity.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.169
For an all-knowing all-powerful deity

00:28:49.169 --> 00:28:52.100
there’d be many simple and obvious measures

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.580
to avoid jeopardising human innocence.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.140
The fact none of those measures were employed

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:05.700
indicates stupidity, incompetence, negligence
or active sadism.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.119
Unlike the mythical god of the Bible

00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:10.239
humans don’t have the magical power

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.820
to engineer environments where innocence can
be sustained.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.019
And yet many still venerate innocence

00:29:17.019 --> 00:29:19.419
still work to preserve it in their children

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.640
and still punish them for worldly knowledge.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.980
The disastrous result is that countless children

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.000
who are kept in a state of ignorance and inexperience

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.920
are left wide open to exploitation

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.159
— a prime example being children
who are given

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.520
no knowledge of sex or sexuality

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.360
and become easy prey for molesters.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.860
This combination of denying sexuality

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.060
and venerating innocence is particularly poisonous.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.760
At school, one of 14-year-old Jasmine’s
friends

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.300
brings in one of her mother’s old copies
of Playgirl.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.190
They giggle at the pictures of the men.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.240
Jasmine’s friend tears off a page for her
to keep.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.480
She hides it under her bed.

00:30:01.489 --> 00:30:05.519
Coming back from school one day she finds
the picture gone.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.640
Later, her mother comes in
brandishing the picture.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.900
She cuts it in two, tears up the body and
saves the head.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.620
She threatens to show it to Jasmine’s father

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.980
— let him know what
a depraved little girl she is.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.160
She continues to dangle that threat over her
daughter

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.640
keeping Jasmine suspended in a limbo of shame,
fear and anxiety.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.500
The blackmail only stops
when her mother inadvertently reveals

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:39.680
where she keeps the photo and Jasmine musters
the courage to destroy it.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:44.220
Many years later, having grappled with severe
trust and shame issues

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.560
Jasmine reminded her mother about that period
of blackmail in her teens.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.500
Her mother said she just couldn’t stand
the fact her baby was growing up.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:58.700
She wanted Jasmine to stay her sweet little
girl forever.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.220
Another big motif infantilising families and
religions share

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.820
is the practice of trying to instil a permanent
sense of debt.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.280
Some parents try to extract gratitude with
the line: ‘I gave you life!’

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.460
As if they did you some favour.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.180
They didn’t.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.360
Before you were conceived, you weren’t some
potential person

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.400
waiting in the wings, hoping for life.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.360
There was no ‘you’.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.840
Your birth wasn’t a gift to you.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.280
It was your parents’ gift to themselves.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.859
They gave themselves a child.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.880
To demand gratitude for a gift you give yourself
is absurd.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.460
Infantilising religions teach followers to
prostrate themselves

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.160
in gratitude to their gods for giving them life.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.139
But again, if any of those gods existed

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.900
there’d be nothing to thank them for.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.820
In Abrahamic mythology, the god character
doesn’t give the human race life.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.860
He gives himself a human race to rule over.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.300
He gives himself an empire.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.919
An act of birth or creation is nothing to
be grateful for.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.000
It’s a completely self-serving act on the
part of the parent.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.800
It’s what parents do for their children
once they’re born that counts.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.980
And even then, many of the things often characterised
as gifts

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.740
to the child are actually parental duties.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.460
It’s no gift to children
to feed them, clothe them,

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.120
shelter them, protect them, nurture them.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.940
Those are just basic responsibilities the
parents took on

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.560
when they decided to have children.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:40.700
And even these bare essentials aren’t fulfilled
by any god characters

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.100
who are conspicuous in their absence.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.780
Gifts by definition are given freely.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.800
Trying to instil a sense of permanent debt

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.520
proves there are no parental gifts
being bestowed here.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.140
It also indicates a very manipulative mindset.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.940
In healthy relationships, people don’t try
to trap each other

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.820
with guilt, obligation and debt.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.680
They stick around because they like each other.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.780
I’ll end with one more feature: the use
of belittling language.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.980
Targets are often addressed with juvenile
pet names

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:22.360
or terms that insinuate immaturity —&nbsp;like
‘young man’ or ‘young woman’.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.400
As with other aspects of infantilisation,
behaviour determines context.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.740
When the actions are friendly and respectful,
there’s no sting.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:36.840
When the actions are patronising and diminishing,
the words become charged.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.360
In religious groups infantilising language

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.880
is sometimes formally built into job titles.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.520
Congregations like the Christian one I was
forced into as a child

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.540
are taught to address priests as ‘Father’

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.180
— an explicitly infantilising term.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.880
The perversity of this parent-child dynamic
is highlighted

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.280
when elderly parishioners
call young priests ‘Father’.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.080
I personally avoided using this title.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.260
I called our priests ‘the vicar’.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.920
The title ‘Father’ seemed creepy for reasons
I couldn’t pinpoint at the time.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.160
I can pinpoint them now.

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:20.760
I was being directed to relate to these total
strangers like I was their son

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.480
bypassing the establishment of any personal
relationships

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.320
or the building of any trust.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.600
Just like it was with the heavenly father

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.480
those things were expected to magically snap
into existence from nothing.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.500
They didn’t.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.140
We mess around with some
very important survival instincts

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:45.240
when we try to shortcut children’s natural
caution around strangers.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.840
Some religious scripture
descends into animalistic imagery

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.280
comparing followers to flocks of sheep

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.780
presided over by shepherds.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.580
As a child I remember recoiling
from this insulting image.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.620
But in retrospect it was a lot more apt than
parent-child language.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.460
Shepherds don’t look after sheep out of
kindness or love.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.840
They look after sheep so long as they’re
useful

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.060
— in the sheep’s case, useful for wool,
meat and profit.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.620
The truth of this metaphor has been experienced

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.520
by millions of people reared in religious
communities

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.100
who learned their value was conditional on
their utility

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.080
and who discovered that those surrogate families

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:30.020
who ‘lovingly protected’ them from knowledge
and experience

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.080
were happy to cut them dead in a heartbeat
when their usefulness expired.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.580
Infantilisation often comes disguised

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:48.940
as love, affection, playfulness, protection.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.100
But when those things are genuine

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:57.160
they don’t leave us feeling suffocated,
debilitated, paralysed.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.520
They don’t leave us dependent, anxious and
neurotic.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.780
If we’re feeling any of those things, it’s
time for a reality check.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.820
We don’t get to choose the company we’re
born into.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.920
But we do get to choose the company we keep.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.640
In most of the real-life cases recounted here

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.740
the infantilised offspring eventually claimed
their freedom

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:25.180
implementing no contact or minimal contact
with rigorous boundaries.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:30.340
A couple of individuals struggled to translate
their awareness into action

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:35.800
and continued to allow draining levels of
contact with their abusive parents.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.980
Infantilised targets often
put up with excessive demands

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.860
for contact from their abusers

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:47.140
—&nbsp;exhausting daily phone calls
and over-extended visits.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.380
They’ve been trained to give abusers as
much of their personal time

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.720
as the abusers want, whenever they want it.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:00.180
Limiting contact often facilitates lots of
other positive changes.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.540
With strong time boundaries in place

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.740
abusers have fewer chances to violate other
boundaries

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.480
because the target isn’t there.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.340
Time apart can help to shed old infantilised habits

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.680
and strengthen new adult ones.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.240
Many targets wrestle with the question of
how much contact is reasonable.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.860
Is a five-minute phone call too short?

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.540
Is fifteen minutes more reasonable?

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:31.420
This kind of overthinking by targets reflects
their anticipation of being judged.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.820
To get out of that frame of mind

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.100
it’s useful for targets to get into the
habit of imagining

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.800
how they’d answer if they were guaranteed
no judgement.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.660
So, if you knew you weren’t going to be
judged for it

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.100
how much contact would you want to have with
this person?

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.700
Whatever answer you give is reasonable.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:57.680
Framing questions in this way reveals our
real feelings.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.820
Being on guard against the manipulative tactic
of infantilisation

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.480
doesn’t mean we have to put away
all childish things.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.340
We’re the sum of all our experiences

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:13.770
— experiences in our childhood, our adolescence
and our adulthood.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:17.290
There’s nothing unhealthy about fondly revisiting

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:21.750
the games, books, TV and films we enjoyed
in our childhood.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.940
The music for this video is a choral version
of a piece I’ve loved

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:30.580
ever since I heard it on a tinny old cassette
player when I was five:

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.340
Camille Saint-Saëns’s ‘The cuckoo in
the depths of the woods’.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:38.580
Growing up isn’t about giving up our past,
but expanding on it.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.520
Being stretched and enriched by experience.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.820
There’s nothing unhealthy about enjoying
child-like affection

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.020
and playfulness in our adult relationships.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.920
The problem arises when the relationship operates

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.980
coercively on that child-like level.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.140
Becoming aware of the subtle slippery elements
of that coercion

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.580
and recognising the difference between care
and confinement

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:12.120
are the first steps in breaking free from
the cage of infantilisation.
