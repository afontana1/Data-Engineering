00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.300
What each of us looks for in our significant personal relationships will differ from person to person.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.520
If we value reflection, personal growth, and independent thought, we'll want our relationships to support those things.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.420
Games and creative pursuits might be important features, giving us an outlet for the playful, inventive parts of our nature.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.340
Something we might consider a relationship essential is the ability to just relax and be our authentic selves.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.320
We might also expect a healthy sense of security, so there's no fear that an innocent slip could land us in trouble,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.840
or that accidents and misunderstandings will get blown out of scale

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.039
Whatever positive, affirming features you look for in a relationship,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.710
you can forget all about them when malignant narcissists manoeuvre themselves into your life.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.860
Personal growth, independent thought, creativity, and authenticity will all get shoved into storage,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.980
leaving you in a rigid, stagnant environment.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.280
Security will evaporate as you begin to realise one wrong step could do you serious damage.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.968
To malignant narcissists, your value begins and ends with your ability to serve them.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.680
Dismissing your needs is just the start: soon the mind games begin.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.820
Like stepping into an Escher print, you'll find yourself completely disorientated by the impossible angles

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.700
of the narcissist's world, where the only predictable feature is unpredictability.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.640
Not only is there no telling where you'll end up when you go through a door,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.200
there's no telling what laws will apply when you get there.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.160
Down might now mean up or sideways.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.140
With each vertigo-inducing flip your brain tries to find some underlying order,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.720
and when you think you might have found it the ground falls from under you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.900
Narcissists use a range of mind games to knock targets off balance,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.660
including love-bombing, gaslighting, and various forms of emotional blackmail.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.200
I want to explore a particularly poisonous mind game called the double bind, which puts people in no-win situations.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.980
I'll be looking at examples of it in action and some different ways of dealing with it.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.349
A no-win manipulation could be defined as the act of putting targets in situations where all actions lead to a negative outcome.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.569
An example would be what's called a Kafka trap: in Kafka traps targets are accused typically of some psychological flaw.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.089
When they deny the accusation, their denial is taken as evidence that the accusation is true.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.739
The possibility that the accusation is false is invalidly excluded.

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.779
Targets of Kafka traps are only presented with losing options by their accuser.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.709
In fact, in many cases, targets do have positive options; one is to simply ignore their accusers.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.909
Another is to expose and mock this fallacious manipulation.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.760
With double binds, these options aren't available.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.800
A double bind is a very specific kind of no-win manipulation

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.260
in which targets are presented with conflicting messages, each of which and negates the other.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.260
In effect, they're told "do X" and "don't do X".

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.380
When targets are playful, they might be criticised for never taking anything seriously.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.540
Then, when they're serious, they're told to stop being a drag and lighten up.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.700
The double message is: "be serious and don't be serious".

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.400
Whatever the target chooses, the abuser responds with the other.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.569
Double binds occur in relationships where targets feel compelled to figure out what the manipulator wants and provide it.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.548
They feel unable to ignore the dilemma presented to them, which is what binds them in.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.720
They often feel unable to point out the injustice of the dilemma because criticism leads to more negative consequences.

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.709
And, they're unable to consult the manipulator to help find a way out.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.860
Double binds can be extremely destructive, psychologically.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.300
Targets of narcissists can tie themselves in knots trying to work out what the narcissist wants.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.880
But all the narcissist actually wants is to make the target fail.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.280
Through repeated experiences of failure, targets can end up in a state of learned helplessness

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.440
where they feel unable to control or change a situation.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.420
Making decisions can become increasingly difficult as targets start habitually questioning their own judgment.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.040
As they become more passive and compliant, the narcissist takes control.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.700
I took a straw poll among my patrons, asking if they could identify any personal experiences of double binds in their lives.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.720
If so, in what areas?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.420
Respondents could tick multiple categories.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.120
2/5 of all respondents reported experiencing this manipulation in personal, one-to-one relationships, respondents

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.940
and half of all respondents encountered it in their family.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.120
A quarter of respondents identified double binds in a religious, political, or pseudoscientific ideological group,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.300
and a quarter experienced them in other environments, including social circles, personal therapy, and the workplace.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.220
In total, three-quarters of all respondents reported experiencing double binds,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.020
with the remaining respondents registering no awareness of having encountered them.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.340
Even acknowledging the limitations of straw polls, this is a very high figure.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.640
And it's worth noting the significant prevalence in one-to-one relationships and in families,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.880
which we might hope would be win-win environments where people lift each other up.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.780
What binds us into double binds comes in many forms.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.500
The complex emotional ties found in one-to-one relationships and families can make very strong binding material,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.020
so strong that we sometimes snap before they do.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:23.780
So what do double binds look like? Here are some examples from literature, history, and my own personal life.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.820
Robert Graves's novel, I Claudius, chronicles the rule of Rome's ancient emperors.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.000
In his portrait of the delusional, murderous Caligula, he depicts a deadly double bind manipulation.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.480
When Caligula returns home triumphantly after an imaginary war with the god Neptune,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.700
he is furious to find there are no cheering crowds to greet him.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.530
No flowers on the streets, no fanfares.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.849
He threatens to kill the senators, who fail to organise any celebrations.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.460
The terrified senators point out that Caligula specifically ordered them not to arrange any celebrations.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:08.270
Caligula scolds them for taking him at his word. He wanted them to show their love for him by disobeying him.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.420
Graves's Caligula delights in putting his subjects in impossible situations.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:20.140
He berates his senators for celebrating the Battle of Actium, in which his great grandfather Mark Antony was defeated,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.120
but he later jokes that he had the senators both ways because if they hadn't celebrated the battle,

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.460
they would have insulted his grandfather Augustus, who won the battle.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:37.980
Being born into a family headed by a narcissistic mother and a timid father who spent his life appeasing, excusing, and enabling her,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.840
double binds of various intensities were part of my early everyday life.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.090
One recurring double bind concerned my responses to her constant false accusations.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.080
Like many narcissists, she was acutely paranoid.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:58.060
She was convinced everyone, from family members to doctors to shop assistants, was out to undermine and belittle her,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:05.660
and she was always telling victory stories recounting her stinging revenge on some unsuspecting individual for an imagined insult.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.340
Because of her paranoia, my brother and I were repeatedly accused of saying doing or even just thinking

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.760
outlandish things we'd never said, done, or thought.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.600
She would charge us to tell the truth in front of her Christian God.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.640
When we truthfully reported our innocence, she'd triumphantly call us liars.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:31.610
She'd often tell us we were physically turning green with guilt. She had unshakable conviction that she was right.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.609
Our no-win choice was to make a false confession and get punished for a non-existent offense,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.499
or tell the truth and suffer even more abuse for lying.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.370
The double message was: "be truthful and don't be truthful".

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.660
Without knowing it, she did teach me something valuable with this double bind.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.949
Displays of unshakable conviction don't require the possession of truth.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.480
Another kind of double bind happened when she gave up things like chocolate or cigarettes,

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:06.480
often as part of a religious observance called Lent, which requires Christians to abstain from some food or luxury for a few weeks.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.040
She'd rope us in to help her instructing us not to let her near those things.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:17.530
When she gave up cigarettes, I caught her lighting up and reminded her she said she wasn't smoking anymore.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:23.379
She scolded me angrily for spoiling her fun, sending the message "don't intervene".

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.460
So the next time she lit up in front of me, I said nothing. She then scolded me for showing no support,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.900
sending the message "intervene".

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:38.040
When she gave up chocolate for Lent I happened to eat a chocolate bar from the kitchen cupboard.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.940
Later that day, she asked where the chocolate was.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.140
When I said I'd eaten it, she flipped into a rage,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.220
slamming cupboard doors and drawers and shouting that she'd planned to eat it herself in secret.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.620
So much for Lent.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.460
As punishment for depriving her I was forbidden all food treats for several days.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.280
In our early teens, when my brother and I left our parents' religion,

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.380
the relentless abuse we endured for that finally pushed us to start forcefully standing our ground.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:13.260
We were fully prepared for an escalation, but she backed off and finally started exercising some self-control.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.760
But her apparent improvement was an illusion.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:23.220
Behind the scenes, she just got worse, which leads me to my last personal example:

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:29.619
an especially venomous breed of double bind, a double bind by proxy, played out through someone else.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:36.620
A couple of years ago the doctors told my father his cancer had returned. This time, it was terminal.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.380
My brother lived nearby and nursed him morning and night.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.480
I lived far away but visited frequently.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.680
On what turned out to be my last visit, I stayed down for a couple of days lodging at a nearby hotel.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.260
It felt like we had a wonderful time, full of laughter.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.040
After saying goodbye, I lingered outside the front door chatting with my brother

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.500
Suddenly, we heard her raging at full volume. It was shocking.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:12.960
I later learned this was a regular routine: during visits she'd store up a list of imagined insults, then explode when they were alone.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:20.840
The most nauseating part was hearing my terminally ill father's exhausted voice trying to appease her anger.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:29.700
I suspended visits for a while and started writing him long weekly letters. They were painful to write, but I kept them upbeat.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:37.840
But after a few letters, he revealed in a phone call that every time my letters arrived, she flew into a jealous rage.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.240
She was resentful of the intimacy and affection in my words.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.860
In a unique moment of candour, he said, "Your mother's a very sick woman".

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.400
It was the only time I ever heard him acknowledge her disorder.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.040
So, instead of lifting his spirits, my letters had become a source of dread for him.

00:11:57.559 --> 00:12:03.099
I asked him if he wanted me to continue writing. The awkward silence that followed said everything.

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:06.519
Her rages weren't just antagonistic now:

00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:12.639
they were deadly, leaving him physically depleted when he needed every ounce of strength

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.868
A few days later we had what would be our last phone call.

00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:24.368
We'd been chatting for a while when he paused and sheepishly asked if I wanted to send a message of love to her.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.700
When I reminded him of the bad blood he knew existed between us, he pretended not to know what I was talking about

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.800
and gave a panicky speech about how everything was fine.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.730
I realised she was listening in and I knew what would follow when he ended the call.

00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:45.939
I now realised all contact with him risked exposing him to the lethal stress of her rages.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.280
I also know if I confronted her it would only rebound on him when they were alone.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.900
I suspended contact while I considered the situation.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.100
She then started telling people I was shunning my dying father.

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:05.209
The double bind was complete: damned if I contacted him, damned if I didn't.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:12.379
A few weeks later my father died in a nursing home, reportedly still appeasing her anger.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.260
Every few months she writes to me urging me to get back in contact,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.520
and blaming her dead husband for causing a rift between me and her.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.320
Double binds sometimes get played out on a larger scale by religious and political zealots

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:36.600
In 17th century England, people accused of witchcraft were faced with a terrifying double bind where both options led to death:

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.359
falsely confess to being a witch and die, or truthfully deny being a witch and die.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.470
Torture was illegal in England at the start of the witch hunts.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:52.290
Originally, the only method of physical coercion legally available to interrogators was sleep deprivation.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.520
This method was successful with the first person accused of witchcraft by professional witch-finder Matthew Hopkins.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.440
Elizabeth Clarke confessed after being kept awake for three days.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:11.100
But a later target of Hopkins, a priest called John Lowes tolerated sleep deprivation for many days.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.980
It was only at this point that torture was introduced illegally in a procedure called "swimming the witch"

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:23.060
in which subjects would be repeatedly pushed to the edge of drowning based on the idea that water would repel witches.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.059
It was this torture that broke John Lowes, who confessed.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:33.480
With England in the middle of civil war, the increasing implementation of illegal torture went unchallenged,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.600
enabling one of the most notorious double binds in history.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:43.800
And, it highlights a crucial point: legal protections don't just safeguard our well-being in the broad sense.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:49.170
They also work to prevent innocent citizens being trapped in state-approved double binds.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.780
As our protections are eroded, we all become increasingly vulnerable to these no-win nightmares.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.660
Another example of this was McCarthyism.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:07.600
Named after one of its main advocates, Senator Joseph McCarthy, this American political witch-hunt gained ground in the 1940s and 50s,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.860
seeking to expose and eradicate what it considered un-American elements.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:18.640
In 1947 a group of screenwriters and directors, who had come to be known as the Hollywood Ten,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:25.780
was subpoenaed to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, chaired by congressman J Parnell Thomas.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:35.520
They were asked whether they were now or ever had been members of the American Communist Party, and whether they'd attended certain political meetings.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.220
If they refused to answer, they could be jailed for contempt.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:45.540
If they answered yes, they'd be commanded to name others; if they refused, they could be jailed for contempt.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.500
If they answered no, they could be vulnerable to charges of perjury.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.420
Being subpoenaed by the House Committee meant they'd already been identified as communists

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.040
by other informants who were granted immunity and couldn't be cross-examined.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.840
As one of the Hollywood 10, Lester Cole, remarked:

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:11.420
"Don't you see, these investigations are actually traps. You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. It's a form of legal lynching."

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:17.440
Like the English witch hunts, this political trap relied on the violation of legal protections,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.149
including constitutional rights to free speech, free association, and free conscience.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.569
Witnesses weren't summoned because they'd committed any crimes.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.440
They were jailed, ostracised, and rendered unemployable purely for exercising their rights under questioning.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.560
It was the House Committee on Un-American Activities that was attacking American values,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.340
redefining un-American on its own terms so that the mere act of questioning the committee became un-American.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:52.130
It's worth mentioning that some months later Committee Chairman J. Parnell. Thomas was charged with fraud.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:59.359
Having jailed witnesses for refusing to answer his questions, Thomas now exercised his own right not to answer questions.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.989
He was jailed, in his case for actual crimes.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.069
These examples illustrate some of the scope of double binds.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:12.109
They also highlight some of the things to bear in mind when we're dealing with this manipulation.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:24.960
Obviously in many cases cutting narcissists out of your life can instantly terminate all the double bind abuse.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:31.589
But going no-contact isn't always an option; for example, for extremely isolated targets who have nowhere to go.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.999
Even when it is an option, some targets might decide for various reasons to hold off from exercising it, at least for a time.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:47.009
If you're constantly subjected to double binds by your boss, quitting impulsively with no job to go to could create big problems.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.510
Instead, you might choose to stay just long enough to secure a new job.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:58.400
If you're dealing with an extremely vindictive narcissist, suddenly going no-contact could spark a revenge campaign.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:05.140
If you'd prefer to sidestep that, you might choose instead to gradually fade over a few months.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:12.220
In some cases targets might choose to go low contact, putting strict limits on their interactions,

00:18:12.769 --> 00:18:16.029
keeping visits or phone calls brief enough to avoid entanglement.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:23.360
For whatever length of time you decide to tolerate your narcissist's company, here are some thoughts on dealing with their double binds.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:28.319
Sometimes the clues to dealing with manipulations lie in their definition.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:34.980
If we look at the defining factors of double binds, we can identify some of the subtle traps embedded in them.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:43.350
Double binds present us with two conflicting messages. The abuser relies on targets believing they have no alternative but to choose one.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.340
After all if someone says "do X" or "don't do X", how can you not choose one?

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.920
By not following one instruction you automatically fulfil the other.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.999
Well, it turns out sometimes you can refuse both choices by shifting to a different level of communication.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:08.500
In their article "Towards a Theory of Schizophrenia", Gregory Bateson and colleagues recount a Zen story illustrating a solution to a triple bind.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.200
The Zen master holds out a stick and tells his students: if they say the stick is real, he'll beat them with it.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:21.709
He then tells them he'll also beat them with it if they say the stick's not real, or if they just say nothing at all.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.849
In response, the student steps forward and breaks the stick. Now the master can't be them with it.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.189
This story perfectly captures the psychology of double binds.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.500
Abusers present targets with a stick and ask them how they'd like to be beaten.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.299
Instead of answering that sadistic question, targets need to learn to break sticks.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:52.220
After being punished for helping my narcissistic parent give up chocolate and cigarettes, I steered clear of whatever food she said she was giving up,

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.420
and I kept myself to myself.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.720
She went to embarrassing lengths to reel me in.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.900
One year, when she gave up cakes, she staged a groan-worthy scene

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.700
where I was obviously meant to discover her in flagrante delicto with a donut.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.840
Luckily, I saw it coming and walked into a different room.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:17.439
Through a crack in the door, I watched her holding onto that donut for ages waiting to be found.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.660
Instead of falling into her double bind of intervene or don't intervene,

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:28.400
I sidestepped both options by sabotaging her plan to be discovered. I broke the stick.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:36.900
One of the things that stops target's identifying solutions to double binds is that they're trained to anticipate what the narcissist wants,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.180
in the perpetual false hope that by pleasing the narcissist, they can avoid a negative outcome.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:49.000
So long as we hold on to that false hope, our narcissists can dangle us like puppets dancing to their tune.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:56.080
We remain in a constant state of anxiety, reacting in reflex knee-jerk ways to the whims of our abusers.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:03.360
But when we let go of that false hope and fully accept the reality that our abusers want to punish us whatever we do,

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.480
we can forget all about pleasing them and start thinking about what we want.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.890
Thinking about what you want keeps you grounded in your own mind instead of getting lost in the abuser's.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.180
You can begin to build and maintain important psychological boundaries.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.559
Instead of reacting mindlessly you can respond mindfully.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:31.440
With a clearer head, targets start seeing solutions to double binds that used to drive them mad when they were chasing after the narcissist's approval.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.010
Sometimes the solution is simply about not responding.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:42.089
Targets are trained to feel unable to ignore the dilemma presented to them, but lots of dilemmas can easily be ignored,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.140
especially when the double bind depends completely on the target reacting.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:51.080
One example is when the narcissist gives you conflicting feedback about your social behavior,

00:21:51.620 --> 00:22:01.280
suggesting you should be serious and not serious, assertive and not assertive, attractive and not attractive, and so on, always putting you in the wrong.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.880
The moment you engage with this kind of feedback you lose.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.419
If you change the way you behave you lose.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.260
You'll start acting inauthentically and you'll inevitably get criticised anyway.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.780
If you try to explain or defend yourself, you lose.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.040
The narcissist can then drag you into more draining pointless conflict.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:30.690
The solution is to disengage. A polite smile will acknowledge you've heard them. You can even thank them for sharing their thoughts.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:36.089
Then you can ignore everything they've said and continue being yourself.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.709
Targets can sometimes ignore a double bind by interrupting it with a deflection.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:49.429
They often learn to spot a double bind on the horizon. And sometimes they can avoid getting entangled by excusing themselves from the interaction.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:58.240
George has a history of long draining phone calls with his narcissist friend Bonnie, who constantly finds fault with him.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.360
When she becomes pregnant she criticises him for asking her about it. Can't he think of something more original?

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:12.000
In their next phone call, he doesn't mention her pregnancy. Now he's accused of showing no interest.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:20.320
Instead of getting stuck in these no-win exchanges ,George could choose to cut the call short, telling her something needs his urgent attention.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:28.189
Preparing deflections to break the narcissist's flow gives you an escape hatch which you can activate at any time.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.330
Targets might be unable to point out the injustice of double binds to the abusers who instigated them,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.060
but they can point out the injustice to other people, and this is where we can all play a part.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.520
It's in all of our interests to help each other when we become aware of abuse.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:53.580
This point really comes through in the religious and political witch hunts: both were made possible because people stood by and declined to help.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.300
Being part of a culture that listens helps to ensure that will be listened to if we should be targeted.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:05.120
I'm not an advocate of automatically believing allegations of abuse.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:13.080
After all, a typical form of narcissistic abuse is the smear campaign, spreading false allegations to stigmatise an individual.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:22.300
Justice is about facts, not assumption. I'm an advocate of due process and responding to allegations with thorough investigation.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:28.900
A family, a community, a nation that cares is one that investigates.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:37.000
Targets of narcissists have become a fast-growing self-supporting community online, sharing experiences and ideas.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:44.820
As awareness of narcissistic abuse increases, more people are beginning to recognise it and acknowledge the damage it does.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:54.109
Lastly, although we're unable to consult our abusers directly for answers, sometimes we can get insights from them indirectly.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:58.100
By observing their behaviour, we can learn some of their weak spots.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:05.440
Something I learned about my narcissist parent was that she was easily thrown by unexpected off-the-wall humour.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:11.380
She never had a comeback and it left her flustered and disarmed. It was like throwing her a puzzle.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.640
As a child, I used this strategy repeatedly to sidestep traps.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:24.420
Targets do need to be subtle about exploiting weak spots: narcissists are liable to attack if they feel deliberately fooled or humiliated.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.640
It's not about prodding the narcissist, but about manoeuvring effectively around them,

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.129
Following on from that, it helps to learn our own weak spots.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:42.499
What vulnerabilities might the narcissist be perceiving and exploiting in us? Do you notice any consistent patterns and themes?

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:51.980
Sometimes our weak spots are other people. When the abuser can't get to us directly, they can sometimes get to us through the ones we love.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:58.480
This happens repeatedly in high control groups, where members feel forced into compliance to protect loved ones.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.960
My father was a huge weak spot.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:09.820
I had a powerful urge to rescue him from her abuse, but he was deeply entrenched in a codependent relationship with her.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.450
When loved ones choose to stay in abusive relationships or groups,

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:20.409
there's often very little we can do except let them know that we love them and that we're there if they want us.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.289
Whatever they do has to be their own choice.

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:30.699
My father made his choice, and it was when I finally accepted his choice that I was able to let go.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:41.020
If the worst comes to the worst and you find yourself in a double bind you can't see any way out of, there are still some principles to bear in mind.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.180
Don't argue or show emotion.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:51.600
Two things many targets learn early on: arguing just gets you more entangled in the situation,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.540
and narcissists love seeing your distress.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.129
Make the choice you feel you can live with.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.790
Sometimes that might mean taking the harder option.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:11.180
In regard to her false accusations, I made a conscious decision never to go along with her and admit to things I'd never said, done, or thought.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.500
Even though I know it meant more punishment because I'd be accused of lying,

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:22.120
I've recognised that there was a bigger personal cost involved if I started bending to fit her distorted reality.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.980
Don't beat yourself up because you didn't think of a way out.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.940
Don't collude with the abuser by bringing yourself down. Stay positive.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.460
Try to think if there's anything you might do differently next time, and use the negative experience

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.080
as motivation to plan a more permanent solution to your abuse in the future.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.999
The no-win Kafka trap is named after dystopian author Franz Kafka.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:54.959
In his parable "Before the Law", the law a man seeking the law is refused access to it by a gatekeeper.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:00.059
The gatekeeper allows him to sit by the gate, letting him think he might be allowed in someday.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.980
The man waits there for the rest of his life, but never gains access.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:10.020
Kefka's story expresses the futility of waiting for justice to come to you.

00:28:11.219 --> 00:28:16.489
My father fell into a similar trap, waiting decades for a peace that never came.

00:28:17.639 --> 00:28:22.459
If targets of narcissists want to end their abuse, they have to be the force for change.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.480
The good news is that narcissistic no-win mind games aren't necessarily the impossible situations they seem.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.140
When we take a step back, we begin to find lots of solutions

00:28:35.219 --> 00:28:39.049
Whether we're the target or the person a target approaches for help,

00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:43.399
we can all do something to combat the abuse of double binds.
