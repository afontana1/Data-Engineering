00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"There once was a family of mice who lived inside a piano, 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.600
knowing nothing of the world outside it. 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.300
When it was played, the sound would fill their little universe. 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.000
They liked the idea that there was 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000
some giant invisible player creating the music. 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.500
One day, one of the mice decided to explore the piano. 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.500
When he returned, he told the other mice he’d discovered 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.500
how the music was really made. 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.600
He’d found wires of different lengths 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.300
which vibrated to make up the different notes. 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.000
Most of the mice began to revise their ideas about their universe, 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.000
though a few still believed in the invisible player. 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.500
Then one day, another mouse went exploring inside the piano. 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.800
When she returned, she told the other mice she’d discovered 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.600
how the music was really made. 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.500
She’d found a row of huge hammers, 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.500
which struck the wires to make them vibrate. 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.300
Most of the mice now felt they had a comprehensive model 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.600
of a purely mechanical universe. 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.500
And while some still believed in the giant invisible player, 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.400
he was generally dismissed as a myth. But the pianist played on."

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.300
This was a story sent to me recently, 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.500
as an illustration of the futility of scientific enquiry 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.700
into the workings of the universe. 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.400
I’d already seen it told in various forums, 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.500
including a church sermon, a debate about belief, 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.000
even a proselytising religious worksheet aimed at school children, 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.000
where the pupils were encouraged to validate its message.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.600
For many atheists, like myself, 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.200
there’s a strikingly obvious problem with the story. 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.500
But for many theists, it’ll go unnoticed. 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.300
I’ll demonstrate the problem later on, 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.000
but I dare say when I was a theist myself, 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.700
I wouldn’t’ve noticed it either. 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.500
In fact, I can attest to going along with 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.300
countless allegorical stories like this, back in the day. 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.300
It can be difficult for some atheists 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.700
who’ve not experienced religious indoctrination 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.600
to grasp how allegories like these 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.000
could ever have any significant influence over people. 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.500
To those atheists, religious allegories are just stories. 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.000
But to the theist, they’re much more.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.500
The power of stories has long been recognised. 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.300
Stretching back into the earliest human records, 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.600
stories have been used to structure ideas, to communicate, 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.600
to teach, to galvanise, or simply to entertain. 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.000
If we didn’t already suspect it to be the case, 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.300
research supports the idea that stories can have 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.700
a ‘transporting’ effect on us, which dulls our critical processes 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.300
and opens us up to substantial manipulation of our real-word beliefs.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.300
In a study into persuasion, 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.400
Green and Brock found that subjects who felt more transported by a story —&nbsp;

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.200
more hooked into its narrative —&nbsp;

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.010
later identified fewer flaws in the story, 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.610
expressed beliefs more consistent with the story, 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.000
and gave more favourable evaluations of the story’s protagonists.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.500
Appel and Richter note that when we engage with a story, 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.000
we cross over into an imaginary world. 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.300
This affects our emotional processing, 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.100
as we begin to experience empathy and identification 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.200
with the characters presented to us. 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.600
It also affects our cognitive processing. 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.300
We’re kind to stories. We play by their rules. 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.600
And our responses can become substantially framed 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.000
by the standards of the imaginary world, 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.800
rather than those of the real world. 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.000
If the story is engaging enough to us, 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.600
dubious ideas can be smuggled into our belief system 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.900
without our awareness, under a blanket of appealing narrative.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.800
Appel and Richter got subjects to read fictional passages 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.800
seeded with false information, and found an immediate effect, 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.300
with subjects’ attitudes shifting in line with the false information.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.000
But beyond that, they saw a larger delayed effect, 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.600
called a sleeper effect, where subjects tested two weeks later 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.600
showed even more pronounced changes in their beliefs,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.600
consistent with the false information, 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.000
as well as a higher level of certainty in those beliefs. 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.300
In many ways, the process being described here 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.000
echoes the parasitic breeding of the cuckoo. 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.600
The cuckoo lays its egg in the nest 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.600
of another bird while it’s not looking. 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.000
The host bird will then vigorously defend the egg 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.000
as if it was its own, even when the cuckoo chick hatches 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.600
and pushes the hosts’ own young out of the nest. 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.300
It’s no coincidence that stories are by far 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.400
the dominant mode of expression in religion. 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.600
The language of faith is not scientific enquiry. 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.000
The daily and weekly congregations gather 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.200
with no intention of assessing their ideas 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.700
against a systematic set of criteria 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.300
designed to eliminate personal biasses. 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.600
In fact, those individuals who do cast a critical eye 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.900
will soon become the target of an escalating schedule of disapproval. 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.600
The language of faith is not logical argument. 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.000
Even to this day, if I mentioned any of the deductive offerings 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.200
of theologians like Anselm, Augustine and Aquinas, 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.300
most —&nbsp;if not all — of the christians in my personal life 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.000
wouldn’t have a clue what I was talking about. 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.600
Religion lives in stories: 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.300
allegories, parables, sermons, personal testimonies. 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.200
Stories told with passion and force. 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.600
Heroic narratives. Cautionary tales. Cataclysmic revelations. 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.600
As theists, these stories transport us. 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.600
And in that transported state, all manner of ideas 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.000
can be inserted into our belief systems without resistance. 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.800
As atheists, religious stories don’t transport us. 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.800
We process the ideas these stories contain in a sober state, 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.500
and the flaws often leap out at us.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.000
As theists, we tend not to be transported 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.000
by the stories of other religions. 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.700
We tend to assess them with detachment .... 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.800
although the lines can begin to blur for us 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.100
when the stories of other religions stray close to ours

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.300
or, conversely, when the stories of our own religion stray too far away.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.500
When I was twelve, and believed in a christian deity called Yahweh, 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.700
a christian speaker came to our school to give a talk. 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.500
In the Q &amp; A after his main speech, someone asked him about hell. 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.000
He smiled and said, ‘Hell isn’t what you think it is.’ 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.000
It’s perhaps worth noting at this point that 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.300
a knowing smile doesn’t actually require knowledge — 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.000
just a mouth.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.500
He then announced that heaven and hell were in fact exactly the same. 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.000
He said that both places were packed with huge long tables, 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.600
lined with bowls of amazing stew. 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.000
Everyone had their own spoon and was free 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.800
to eat as much as they liked,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.800
as the food would never run out. 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.600
The only problem was the spoons were twice the length of their arms, 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.000
so they couldn’t bring it to their mouths. 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.300
And indeed when you looked around hell, 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.500
the damned were all starving and emaciated. 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.100
But when you looked around heaven, 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.800
where the spoons were just as long, 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.800
everyone was well fed and healthy.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.800
The speaker then invited the audience to guess why. 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.300
Hands shot up, and one boy answered 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.800
that the people in heaven fed each other. 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.000
Well, it was hardly applied physics, was it. 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.600
The speaker nodded sagely. 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.000
As a fellow christian, sitting in that audience, I was bemused. 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.700
This was categorically not what hell was like. 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.600
Hell was the everlasting fire, 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.400
into which the damned would be thrown on judgement day, 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.000
and from which there was no escape. 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.800
As I left the talk I wasn’t sure whether 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.500
the speaker had committed blasphemy by misrepresenting hell. 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.000
But I did know his long spoon story was an incoherent mess. 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.200
There seemed to be an implicit assumption in the story 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:53.100
that feeding someone else implied empathy, charity, generosity, love — 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.500
and that it was for the lack of these qualities that the folks in hell starved. 

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.400
But feeding someone else neither implied nor necessitated any of these traits. 

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.600
Cooperation is observed throughout the natural world. 

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.500
A remarkable example can be seen among hermit crabs, 

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.600
who use abandoned shells as a home. 

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.000
As they grow, they have to find progressively larger shells to contain them. 

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.800
When a large unused shell washes up on a beach, 

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.300
hermit crabs of all sizes can be seen to gather round it, 

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.400
and sort themselves into a cue of ascending size. 

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.000
They’ll each then move into the next larger shell, 

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.200
leaving the smallest shell empty. 

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.300
Do they behave this way because they’re aspiring 

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.200
to some moral or religious virtue? Of course not. 

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.800
They’ve learned to cooperate because it brings mutual benefit. 

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.800
Just like we have. Even at the age of twelve, 

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.900
I knew full well that the most greedy, self-serving individuals 

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.600
would be among the first to feed each other with those long spoons, 

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.000
not out of love for their fellow human

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.200
but because they recognised what was good for them. 

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.000
As such, according to the division suggested in the story of the long spoons, 

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.000
these uncharitable folks would be in heaven, not hell. 

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.500
The depth of wisdom this story hinted at 

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.600
was nothing more than a wafer-thin veneer. 

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.700
The speaker wanted it both ways. 

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.200
He wanted to present hell as a place beyond reproach; 

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.000
an unappreciated utopia, overflowing with food enough for everyone. 

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.000
But at the same time, he needed it be a place of agonising torture. 

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:28.500
In order to try and reconcile these irreconcilable extremes, 

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.100
he was forced to populate hell 

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.700
with suicidally uncooperative cartoon characters — 

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.000
and hope the audience was all too swept up to notice.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.800
I wasn’t swept up. 

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.100
It was too significant a departure from the fiery pit 

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.600
in which I’d been coerced to believe. 

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.800
But clearly, others were. 

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.200
Members of a school christian group to which I belonged 

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.500
had been very inspired by the speaker 

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.600
and readily took on this new definition of hell.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.200
In view of the long-lasting manipulative potential of stories, 

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.600
Appel and Richter end their paper by proposing that 

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.500
further research is needed on strategies that people can use 

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.000
to actively prevent information in fictional narratives 

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.300
changing their real-world beliefs.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.900
Just knowing about the power of stories 

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.700
is a good first step toward immunisation.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.500
Another step might be to reconsider 

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.000
some of the stories we’ve found persuasive, 

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.500
and think about what exactly they persuaded us of; 

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.800
perhaps play around with the details, 

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.400
to highlight the elements we’ve let slip by with noticing. 

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.000
Which brings us back to the mice and the piano.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.500
"There once was a different family of mice 

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.400
who lived inside a different piano. 

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.700
The sound would fill their little universe. 

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.200
They liked the idea that there was 

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.000
some giant invisible player creating the music. 

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.400
The pianist sometimes played with seven other musicians, 

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.000
forming an octet. 

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.400
One day some of the young mice went exploring inside the piano. 

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.500
When they returned, they told the old mice 

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.000
that they’d discovered wires that vibrated 

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.500
when struck by giant hammers 

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.700
to produce some of the notes in the music. 

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.600
But this only accounted for one of the sounds they heard. 

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.100
They suggested that maybe there were 

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.800
many giant invisible players, 

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.800
each in charge of a different sound 

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.300
and all playing together in harmony. 

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.000
But the old mice scoffed at this preposterous notion. 

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.700
No. There could only be one invisible player. 

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.500
To the old mice, it pointed to one conclusion: 

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.000
their beloved invisible player must simply be even larger, 

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.000
more complex and more mysterious than they’d ever imagined. 

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.800
They’d previously conceptualised him as a giant mouse,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.700
but if he was a mouse, he must have hundreds of legs. 

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.200
Perhaps he was so powerful, 

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.200
he didn’t even have a body, just a mind. 

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.000
Yes that was it. The music was made 

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.500
by a single powerful disembodied mind. 

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.400
But the octet played on.”

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.000
So, listening to this story, have you become a polytheist? 

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.800
If not, why not? 

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.900
After all, if it’s true of mice and pianos, ergo it must be true of life. 

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.100
From this story, we can see that the universe 

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.000
is obviously the work of many beings working together. 

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.200
You wouldn’t want to be like the stubborn old mice 

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.500
who had to invent some incoherent nonsense 

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.500
about a disembodied mind, just to preserve their false beliefs.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.000
"There once was another family of mice 

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.600
who lived inside a clockwork piano in an old, abandoned house. 

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.800
Its inventor had constructed the piano decades ago 

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:34.000
and had long since died by the time the mice’s ancestors had moved in. 

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.300
Every so often his music would start up automatically 

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.500
and play through its cycle. 

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.300
The mice were comforted by the idea 

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.000
that there was a giant invisible player. 

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.300
But in fact they were all alone.”

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.400
So, after hearing this, who now believes 

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.700
there was a creator god who set up the universe 

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.400
but then died before we came along? 

00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.200
No? But the story proves that’s exactly what happened. 

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.100
Didn’t you get the story? 

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.000
Didn’t you comprehend its deeper meaning?  

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.000
"There once was yet another family of mice 

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.300
who lived inside yet another piano. 

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.200
When it was played, the sound would fill their little universe. 

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.600
They liked the idea that there was 

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.800
some giant invisible player creating the music. 

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.100
One day, as the pianist played, 

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.900
he heard a strange scratching noise and opened the piano lid. 

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.500
When he looked inside his precious piano, 

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.100
to his horror, he saw it was covered in mouse shit. 

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.000
He immediately phoned the exterminators."

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.600
You get the point. Like so many other allegories, 

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.800
what makes the story of the mice and piano worthless 

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.700
is that you can use it to justify any conceivable religion you like. 

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.100
Just as circular arguments fallaciously smuggle into their premises 

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.600
the thing they set out to prove in the conclusion, 

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.900
circular allegories like the mice and piano 

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.100
present deities as self-evident 

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.600
in order to illustrate that deities are self-evident. 

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.800
But deities are not self-evident, 

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.300
which is self-evident from the fact that 

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.700
members of different religious groups each believe 

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:17.100
that their conflicting descriptions of deities are self-evident.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.700
No one knows the entire explanation of the universe. 

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.800
But so far humankind has managed to piece together some of it. 

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.800
And we’re continually discovering more. 

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:29.000
What lies beyond our knowledge can simply be labelled ‘We don’t know’. 

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.800
Well that’s the honest and accurate way to label it, isn’t it? 

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.000
There’s no false claim in that label; 

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.200
no assumption; no bias; no prejudice. 

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.700
Nothing that would colour our enquiries. 

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.400
The same can’t be said when we label the unknown: 

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:55.000
Odin, Hermes, Hanuman, Yahweh, Anubis 

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.400
or any other of the panorama of deities 

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.400
humans have proposed over the millennia. 

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.600
This is no longer open enquiry. 

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.200
We’re no longer following the evidence 

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.100
or the argument wherever they lead. 

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.800
We’re instead leading the evidence and the argument 

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.800
where we want them to go. 

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.100
Let’s think for a moment about the sheer perversity of doing this. 

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.000
Imagine that between you and the answers 

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.300
to the ultimate nature of the universe lies a maze. 

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.600
There are trails of evidence in the form of tiny breadcrumbs 

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.300
which will guide you through the maze. 

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.600
With enough focus and persistence, 

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.000
the breadcrumbs can be detected and followed, 

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.500
and eventually you will find those ultimate answers. 

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.300
Now imagine walking through the maze 

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.400
throwing your own breadcrumbs ahead of you 

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.900
down a path you’ve already decided to walk. 

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.800
Because that’s exactly what you’re doing 

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.200
when you decide in advance the nature of the universe. 

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.800
And like all those before you who wanted the universe to fit 

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.800
their preconceived fantasy, rather than get to know it on its own terms, 

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.800
you are dooming yourself to a dead end.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.000
We don’t know everything about the universe. 

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.800
But the parts we do know certainly didn’t come from religion, 

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.000
and the pseudo-wisdom of its stories. 

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.100
Stories that taught us the sun had one setting place, 

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.100
and that the stars in the sky were small enough 

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.600
to fall down on the Earth like figs falling from a shaken fig tree.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.600
Stories that taught us 

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:14.100
to see diseases like leprosy as curses and divine punishments; 

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:18.200
to take hallucinations and seizures as signs of demonic possession. 

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.600
Stories that led to countless thousands of women 

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.700
being defined as witches possessing nonexistent magical powers —&nbsp;

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.100
leading to their torture and murder in the witch hunts. 

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.200
When we brace ourselves to look with an unflinching eye 

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.300
at exactly the kind of superstitious swamp 

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.700
in which we would now be living 

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.200
if we’d relied on religion as a source of knowledge, 

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.600
then the true power of stories becomes disturbingly apparent.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.300
Wherever we’ve made progress, 

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.000
it’s always been through the exploration and observation of our universe; 

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.600
by men and women who possessed the drive, 

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.900
the discipline and often the courage 

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.700
to contradict the supposed wisdom of stories.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.000
Some atheists describe the stories in the holy books as fairy stories. 

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.500
And that might sting. 

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.400
But the comparison is nonetheless worth reflection. 

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.000
You don’t come away from fairy stories 

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:10.600
believing in sorcerers, goblins, talking dragons, magic porridge bowls. 

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.500
You come away thinking about the choices the characters made. 

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.100
Stories can have great value 

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.300
in describing human feelings, motivations and behaviour. 

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.700
Seeing human or non-human characters in challenging situations 

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.200
can give us insight into our own natures and expand our choices. 

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.000
But stories cannot be used to prove the existence of supernatural phenomena.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.600
So if, when you look at your beliefs about reality, 

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.100
you do find fairytale notions among them —&nbsp;talking snakes, 

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.600
people living for days inside giant fish, 

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.200
demon-possessed pigs, 

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.600
afterlives full of servants and juicy virgins —&nbsp;

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.400
have a think about how those ideas got planted there. 

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.700
Because if you believe in these things, I guarantee you: 

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.100
someone’s been telling stories.
