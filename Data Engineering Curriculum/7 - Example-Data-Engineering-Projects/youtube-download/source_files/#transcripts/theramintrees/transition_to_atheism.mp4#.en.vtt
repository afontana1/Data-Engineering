00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.910
Several people have mailed me recently, sharing
that they're questioning their own religious beliefs.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.200
Reading their different stories, i'm prompted to share
my own transition to atheism with them —

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.260
and whoever else is interested

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.160
taking into account both the emotional and
the cognitive components of that switch.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.540
So here are two videos, each addressing
one of those aspects

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.180
and using psychological models as frameworks
to contextualise the psychological events involved.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:38.020
Sometimes we must face tremendous pain.
The pain of not knowing, of aloneness, of finality.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.960
When we run from that pain, it looms ever larger.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.320
And, fighting fear with fear, we doom ourselves to war.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.980
But when we embrace that pain, it fades to nothing.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.250
And we can move forward, unafraid and curious.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.850
In this video I'm using a seven-stage model
of psychological transition,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.890
put forward by Sugarman in her book
Life Span Development,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.390
to explore the emotional side of my transition
from christian to atheist.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.219
But first a word about an event that marked
the beginning of my transition to atheism.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.369
I was in a religious education class at my
non-religious school.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.530
We'd just swapped teachers.
The first teacher was very religious.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.870
He was later discovered taking pictures of
some school boys naked round his house,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.980
but let's don't dwell on that shall we.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.800
His replacement was a cool customer,
I'd say almost military in his demeanour

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.619
— and indeed in his safari jackets.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.509
We had a few template, generic lessons,
nothing mind-blowing

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.819
—&nbsp;just learning words like talmud and brahmin.

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.229
Then a lesson where the teacher —&nbsp;let's
call him Mr Elliot; well that was his name —

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.360
showed a science video, which contradicted
bits of the Bible, particularly Genesis.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.340
For homework, he asked us to write an essay
about our thoughts.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.320
I went home and wrote the most pompous little
piece of dogma you could imagine.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.220
No arguments against the video. 
Just dismissing it out of hand.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.109
And finishing off proudly with: 'I am a christian.
My views will never change!'

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.729
Well. Mr Elliot marked it. I got it back.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.949
And saw he'd commented:
'Yes, you've written what your beliefs are.

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:05.400
'But are you able to say why you believe them?"

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.509
That was all he'd written.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.720
And I wanted him wiped from the face of the planet.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.319
I think this would be a good point to introduce
the model of psychological transition.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.519
We start with stage one: immobilisation.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.880
When I first read Mr Elliot's comment,
I just felt total disorientation.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.580
To me, age 12, god in the christian form I'd
been indoctrinated with, was just reality.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.080
I'd never questioned it. Now, for the first
time, I was being asked for my reasons.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.159
I didn't have a clue. All I came up with in
my head was "It's true because it just is!"

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.010
And even I recognised how lame that sounded.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.470
I felt exposed.
I felt caught out, made a fool of.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.159
Not by the people who'd indoctrinated me 
—&nbsp;no, by Mr Elliot.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:53.209
Within days, I developed such a hatred and
detestation for Mr Elliot it was untrue.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.989
I'd watch him stand there in the background
during assemblies

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.840
and find myself mentally seething, 'Who the Hell
do you think you are??'

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.140
I was convinced he was laughing at me,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.180
sneering at me and my beliefs —&nbsp; which,
I should say, he never did.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.040
That was total projection on my part.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.800
But eventually I moved into minimisation,
alleviating some of my stress with a bit of rationalising.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.260
I rationalised that — all the adults I knew
were christian so christianity was bound to be correct.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.239
I was comforted by the idea I was part of
the majority.

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.479
It's funny, that was probably the last time
I ever felt part of a majority.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.220
Anyway I told myself I'd simply
get the answers from them.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.000
Unfortunately when I asked,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.719
I discovered my fellow christians couldn't
come up with anything better than I had.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.140
Which threw me back to stage one.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.620
And I hovered round these stages for some time.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.090
Well, that's what happens, you move forward,
you slip back.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.210
I did everything I could think of to try and
find ways to back up my beliefs.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.760
Reading the bible was one
of my more counter-productive strategies,

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.889
because it only opened up a whole world of
new contradictions I'd not even thought of.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.660
Eventually, feeling quite drained,
I slumped into stage three.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.180
I began to recognise that the situation
probably wasn't going to be rescued.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.379
Outwardly I was living the same life,
going to church.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.230
I guess still wanting to hang on to it.
But it all felt totally hollow.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.379
Mechanical. And so did I.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.670
Gradually I slipped into stage four.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.439
I finally acknowledged there was no substantial
foundation for the beliefs I'd been indoctrinated with.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.090
I felt I'd been made to say and do the most
ridiculous things in the name of that belief.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.890
I'd been made to experience the most horrendous
fantasies of eternal torture;

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.410
the most horrendous emotions of guilt, fear
and shame over absolutely nothing.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.540
The scale of it was very hard to accept.
But finally I had accepted it.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.680
I began to look around at different belief systems
that might fill the emptiness left behind.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.590
I looked at different religions, at the occult.
But they all had the same problems.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.590
I was in limbo.
With a sense of no direction or identity.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.990
And I began to question what 'identity' actually meant.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.610
I started considering my options,
testing new behaviours.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.750
First off, announcing at age 14 that I didn't
believe in god and was leaving the church.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.020
Which immediately sparked a welter of scorn,
contempt, threats, guilt trips, all manner of judgements.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.979
It was a real eye-opener.

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.590
So next I had to develop new strategies to
cope with that bullying.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.610
I think for a while I felt so alienated I
just blanked it out.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.940
I didn't recognise these people anymore.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.260
But, as it continued, I began to answer back

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.960
and pull apart the comments
and arguments that were coming my way.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.150
I toughened up.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.940
I knew I was doing nothing wrong in thinking
for myself,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.220
and actually I just wasn't going to take anymore
punishment for it.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.840
Christian teachers at school who I'd previously
been friendly with

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.040
began to exert their own quasi-parental disapproval.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.580
So, socially, I learned to cut them absolutely dead.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.479
Kept things strictly academic.

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.169
Shutting people out like that was quite isolating.

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.160
But if it was a choice between isolation,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.630
or being with people who didn't want me to think,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.759
there was no choice.

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.479
One of life's rules: people who don't want
you to think are never your friend.

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.020
Anyway this part of the transition became
substantially about building boundaries.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.009
I'd had very few if any boundaries up to that point.

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.509
Which is probably why so many people felt
so relaxed about walking all over me.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.820
They never felt they were stepping over the
line because there was no line.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.870
But now I was drawing that line
— and sticking to it hard.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.140
And gradually relationships shifted back,
albeit grudgingly, into some semblance of respect.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.720
I'd been handed the meaning of my life as a child.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.600
I now had to find my own meaning.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.340
But I quickly discovered that life without religion
wasn't the barren land I'd been told it would be.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.140
I found meaning in searching out the truth of things;

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.400
in scientific enquiry; in argument against poor logic
and reasoning, particularly supernatural dogmas.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.250
I found meaning in psychological exploration;

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.879
in addressing the distortions that are sometimes forced on us in life, and finding ways to counteract them.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.050
My morality, if anything, deepened.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.160
I was doing things now not because I'd been
instructed or coerced

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.550
but because I'd considered the underlying
principles on a human level.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.670
Whatever old meaning I'd lost was more than
replaced by the new meaning I found.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.640
Finally the transition was resolved.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.260
I was at ease with myself. The issues that came up
during the transition no longer dominated my life

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.819
And I moved on.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.050
It'll be plain, to those who've listened,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.800
that my transition to atheism wasn't some empty rebellion or a descent into self-indulgent immorality.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.440
It wasn't someone coming along and corrupting
my young brain with blasphemous ideas.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.360
It was a child actively struggling to hold
onto his religious illusions,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.440
but eventually acknowledging that there was
absolutely no foundation,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.169
to believe what he'd been told.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:28.029
I've had many great teachers in my life,
teachers I've laughed and joked around with,

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:31.060
teachers I've confided in,
teachers I've had crushes on.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.860
I never had much to do with Mr Elliot.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.699
But I'll always be grateful to him for challenging me,

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:40.179
with that simple, and actually very respectful comment,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.139
considering the tumescence of my essay's pomposity.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:50.239
I think of that comment as the surgical knife
in the caesarean section of my intellectual life.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.320
Some blood and guts along the way, birth pains, sure.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.360
But finally freedom from the confinement
that felt so snug and protective,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.010
that I didn't realise how utterly immobilising
and stultifying it actually was.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.820
To anyone watching this, who finds themself
in any of the stages of transition described here,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.539
my very best wishes.

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:12.030
You're on your own journey —&nbsp; it won't
be the same as mine —

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.140
but maybe there'll be some parallels.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.320
Now there will undoubtedly be some who see this video

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.889
and try to distort the personal story I've shared

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.329
into a fantasy more consistent with the prejudices
they hold against atheists.

00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:27.479
And in the accompanying video —&nbsp;'atheism
as congruence'&nbsp;—

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:29.879
I'll explore how that kind of distortion can
come about.
