00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.600
Recovery from abuse — whether it’s political,&nbsp;
religious, occupational, domestic —

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.840
involves the same fundamental process.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.440
Targets have to restore what the abuse eroded

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.520
sometimes almost into non-existence:

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.440
their sense of self.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.080
That involves reasserting the freedoms&nbsp;
and entitlements they’ve gone without

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.160
looking after their own welfare

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.840
refusing to accept unfair responsibility

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.120
getting comfortable expressing&nbsp;
needs they’ve previously suppressed

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.400
and ending destructive relationships.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.720
Targets have to replace old self-negating&nbsp;
thoughts of inferiority and unworthiness

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.960
with new self-affirming principles.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.960
As we know, terms from psychology

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.880
like ‘paranoid’, ‘unconscious’,&nbsp;
‘passive aggressive’

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.200
that find their way into common usage

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.360
aren’t always applied accurately.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.800
Or therapeutically.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.280
Often they’re used to attack&nbsp;
and falsely pathologise people.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.680
In a similar way

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.320
as therapeutic self-affirming principles

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.240
have become more widely known,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240
they’ve been seized on by abusers

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.880
and twisted into weaponised parodies.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.920
Sentiments intended to repair&nbsp;
damage are used to inflict damage.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.240
Concepts intended to promote&nbsp;
equal freedoms and entitlements

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.440
are used to assert unequal liberties and licence.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.760
When malignant abusers speak of valuing themselves

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.440
of exercising autonomy, of resisting suppression

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.360
it all sounds very reasonable

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.960
until we realise that for them valuing&nbsp;
themselves means devaluing others

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.360
exercising autonomy means&nbsp;
restricting the autonomy of others

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.440
suppression means not being&nbsp;
given special priority.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.200
These pseudo-self-affirmations illustrate why

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.640
even when targets and malignant&nbsp;
abusers speak the same words

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.880
they’re often using very different languages.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.120
Targets who work to establish a level&nbsp;
playing field show a lateral orientation

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.760
where people can coexist side by side.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.080
This is literally at cross purposes with abusers

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.240
who show a vertical orientation

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.680
constantly working to elevate&nbsp;
themselves above others

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.120
sometimes because of a personal superiority complex

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.480
sometimes because some&nbsp;
religious or political ideology

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.720
encourages them to look down on other people

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.440
sometimes a combination of the above.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.880
As targets strive for equity&nbsp;
abusers strive for inequity.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.400
As targets work to restore balance&nbsp;
abusers work to restore imbalance.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.520
For targets, the vertical orientation&nbsp;
of the abuser is oppressive.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.960
Their needs, freedoms,&nbsp;
individuality, sense of self

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.680
are all squashed down to accommodate the abuser.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.720
In a perverse mirror image of this

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.880
abusers claim the lateral orientation&nbsp;
of targets is oppressive to them.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.000
From their elevated position, equality&nbsp;
and fairness seem diminishing.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.560
While the target’s claim of&nbsp;
oppression is consistent with reality

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.000
the abuser’s is not.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.800
The abuser’s claim of oppression

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.120
doesn’t represent some alternative&nbsp;
but equally valid ‘truth’.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.080
It’s the bogus product of a misconception

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.280
one that inspires equally bogus&nbsp;
attempts at self-affirmation.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.840
Some of these pseudo-self-affirmations&nbsp;
are easily dismissed.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.640
But others are more slippery

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.080
sometimes exploiting poorly&nbsp;
conceived mental health concepts.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.200
For some targets, trying to get a grip&nbsp;
on them is like trying to hold wet soap.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.160
I want to look at some examples that&nbsp;
crop up repeatedly in correspondence.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.080
It was around 15 years ago&nbsp;
that I was sat in my front room

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.360
listening to a house guest I’ll call Vigo

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.480
ranting about how his father&nbsp;
owed him unconditional love.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.800
Apparently his father had&nbsp;
refused contact for several days

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.440
in response to constant abuse from Vigo

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.400
who believed he should be free&nbsp;
to behave any way he wanted

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.880
towards his father and that his father was obliged

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.920
to respond with an uninterrupted stream of love.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.080
Vigo showed no remorse and minimised his abuse

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.760
with various titbits of&nbsp;
Christmas-cracker philosophy.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.440
He pontificated that real love&nbsp;
was ‘messy’ and ‘painful’.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.000
Odd how it always seemed to be his&nbsp;
father who got the pain and mess.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.160
Vigo’s shrill sermon on unconditional love

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.680
was one of my first glimpses&nbsp;
of a rampant narcissism

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.080
that for a time flew under my radar.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.560
Unconditional love is a&nbsp;
term I could happily consign

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.160
to the trash can of history.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.400
It’s presented as the answer to conditional love —

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.720
love that’s only given if targets&nbsp;
comply with various selfish demands.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.040
If they don’t —&nbsp;if they don’t&nbsp;
choose a particular career

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.880
if they don’t choose the right partner

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.200
if they don’t follow certain&nbsp;
religious or political beliefs

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.720
love is withdrawn.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.880
People subjected to this iffy brand of love

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.240
often fail to develop a stable&nbsp;
internal sense of worth.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.400
They come to depend on unstable external supply

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.680
only feeling fleeting experiences of worth

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.160
when they fulfil the demands of other people.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.600
Self-affirming therapy and literature&nbsp;
promote ‘unconditional love’

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.840
as the healthy alternative to this coercion.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.280
Targets are told they should&nbsp;
be loved for who they are

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.440
without having conditions imposed on them.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.520
Unfortunately abusive individuals like Vigo

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.520
have also latched on to this&nbsp;
poorly articulated concept

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.600
insisting they should be loved for who they are

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.840
without having conditions imposed on them.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.680
Conditions like taking&nbsp;
responsibility for their actions

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.360
showing remorse, offering restitution

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.080
and rectifying their behaviour.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.120
We’re back to the fundamental&nbsp;
conflict in orientation.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.320
We have targets pursuing equal status

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.640
seeking only to eliminate oppressive&nbsp;
conditions that violate their freedoms.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.040
And we have abusers pursuing superior status

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.080
seeking to eliminate all conditions placed on them

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.400
but happy to impose conditions on others.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.040
Some of the most extreme examples&nbsp;
are found in religious scripture.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.160
The god character of the Bible

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.600
was depicted perpetrating all kinds of atrocities

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.400
from the explicit endorsement of sexual slavery

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.000
to the joyful celebration of mass infanticide

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.120
to the implementation of death sentences

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.680
for a raft of victimless activities

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.400
including working on the Sabbath

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.320
and approaching a tabernacle.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.000
Despite its profound disregard for life

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.840
this morally chaotic god character&nbsp;
demanded unquestioning love.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.480
The love it offered in return&nbsp;
was strictly conditional

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.120
only bestowed if its commands were obeyed

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.040
although even then, love&nbsp;
was by no means guaranteed.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.840
It’s worth mentioning a similar&nbsp;
weaponised self-affirmation

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.480
we might call ‘unconditional attraction’

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.000
where individuals insist other&nbsp;
people should find them attractive.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.880
People who don’t are accused of&nbsp;
prejudice and\or pathologised.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.240
Meanwhile these self-aggrandising individuals

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.120
have no problem labelling&nbsp;
other people unattractive.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.800
The concept of love without any conditions

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.840
is an unworkable foundation for relationships

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.320
even as a two-way model.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.240
Placing no conditions on each other

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.360
means whatever we do — however good or bad —

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.720
is of no consequence.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.280
No part of us is rejected

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.000
but no part of us is valued either.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.560
Lecturer in political philosophy Derek Edyvane

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.760
underscores the problem:

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.920
‘.... a large part of what we value

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.160
‘about being the object of another’s love

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.520
‘is that we take it to imply&nbsp;
an informed and positive

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.200
‘(or at least not negative)

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.200
‘objective evaluation of our character.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.840
‘We think of love as being more

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.800
‘than the arbitrary expression&nbsp;
of a subjective whim.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.040
‘We want to know that there exist reasons

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.480
‘that can render this person’s love&nbsp;
for us intelligible to others.’

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.200
What meaning could someone’s love&nbsp;
have for us if we could be anybody?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.600
Healthy love isn’t love without conditions.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.360
It’s love with boundaries.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.800
Boundaries give a clear structure that preserves

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.280
the freedoms and entitlements of both parties.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.600
A common characteristic of&nbsp;
unhealthy and abusive relationships

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.720
is that identities become blurred and merged.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.360
Individuals become lost in each other

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.960
no longer able to separate

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.880
their own preferences, beliefs, desires, needs.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.960
Firm boundaries prevent this kind of enmeshment

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.760
allowing people to maintain&nbsp;
a separate sense of self.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.120
None of us is owed love.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.480
We either inspire it in some people or we don’t.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.080
Those who don’t inspire it often try to compel it.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.520
But the use of compulsion in itself

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.840
turns any potential love into a degraded pretence.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.040
Targets of abuse are routinely&nbsp;
blamed for their abusers’ feelings

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.280
— their jealousy, anger, resentment, sorrow —

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.880
and taught that it’s their responsibility&nbsp;
to keep their abusers happy.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.280
Over time, targets often become acutely sensitised

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.360
to other people’s emotional states

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.560
and instinctively take on the&nbsp;
burden of looking after them.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.720
Self-affirming therapy and&nbsp;
literature encourages targets

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.760
to question this misguided sense of liability

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.520
and to realise they don’t control

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.280
the emotional states of other people

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.760
and it’s not their job to fix them.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.840
They’re not responsible for&nbsp;
other people’s feelings.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.520
This self-affirmation has been seized on

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.320
and repurposed by abusive individuals

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.360
who use it to try and avoid&nbsp;
accountability for their actions.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.520
When targets have an emotional&nbsp;
reaction to their mistreatment

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.880
their abuser tells them: ‘I’m not&nbsp;
responsible for your feelings.’

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.360
And they’re absolutely right.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.640
Just as we can’t control their emotional states

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.080
they can’t control ours.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.840
For some targets this feels like a stumper.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.480
They struggle to refute their&nbsp;
abusers’ slippery insinuation

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.360
that if they’re not responsible&nbsp;
for the target’s feelings

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.960
they can’t be accused of abuse.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.160
The focus on feelings here&nbsp;
is a complete red herring.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.560
People have all kinds of reactions to abuse.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.560
Some people shut down&nbsp;
completely and show no emotion.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.320
In assessing whether a situation is abusive

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.320
we don’t base our judgement on&nbsp;
people’s emotional reactions.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.560
We ask if there are persistent patterns

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.880
of controlling and coercive behaviour

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.280
that violate their freedoms and entitlements.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.160
Are there attempts to isolate them?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.560
Are their private communications monitored?

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.800
Is their physical appearance dictated?

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.600
Are their job opportunities sabotaged?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.840
Are their finances restricted?

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.600
Are their resources exploited?

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.840
Are shaming tactics used?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.160
Are there threats of violence?

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.760
These are the factors that define abuse

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.920
and incriminate individuals in law.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.600
As noted by the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.840
— an official legal body that determines&nbsp;
which cases make it to court —

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.760
‘Domestic abuse does not always&nbsp;
have to be physical to be prosecuted

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.680
‘— sometimes victims may not&nbsp;
even be aware it is happening.’

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.680
Agreeing with our abusers&nbsp;
that they’re not responsible

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.160
for our feelings doesn’t in any way

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.480
deny their accountability for what they do.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.240
In fact, realising our abusers&nbsp;
don’t and can’t control our feelings

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.320
is often a key moment in recovery.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.400
Targets of abuse often lose their spontaneity.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.920
They fall into fixed habitual responses.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.040
Abusers learn these predictable responses.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.240
And when they provoke one of those responses

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.840
the target feels controlled.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.480
But that sense of being controlled begins to fade

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.880
when targets change their responses.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.920
For some years in my childhood

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.240
an abusive relative always seemed able

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.840
to control me with the same threat:

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.840
‘If you don’t do X, you and I are gonna fall out.’

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.120
Hearing that line, like clockwork,&nbsp;
I’d fall into silent compliance.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.880
Then one day, I found myself replying

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.320
‘Yeah. We will fall out.’

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.080
The look of bewilderment was priceless.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.040
Those five words transformed our relationship.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.640
We both knew the threat had lost its power

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.240
and it was never used again.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.080
But more importantly, I&nbsp;
began to recognise the part

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.080
my own fixed responses played&nbsp;
in my sense of being controlled.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.640
Targets of abuse often become so hyper-focused

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.800
on attending to their abusers’ demands

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.120
they habitually neglect their own needs.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.560
Self-affirming therapy and literature

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.440
encourage targets to exercise self-care.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.360
Predictably the concept of self-care

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.400
has been weaponised by abusive individuals

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.120
who use it to justify selfish indulgence.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.400
During my training as a therapist

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.560
a fellow student I’ll call&nbsp;
Zane repeatedly tried to impose

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.120
his values, his ideas, his&nbsp;
preferences on the rest of the group.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.760
To justify his demands

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.960
he’d regurgitate the same phrase ad nauseam:

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.520
‘I’m just looking after my needs!’

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.480
If his demands weren’t met, he’d&nbsp;
often refuse to participate.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.160
An example.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.760
During the course Zane complained repeatedly

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.640
about students using adult&nbsp;
language in his presence.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.597
He said it was course and offensive.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.840
One day, in a group discussion

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.960
he declared we all had an obligation

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.000
to use what he called ‘genteel language’

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.120
— ie refined and respectable.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.520
It was pointed out to him

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.800
that no one had consented&nbsp;
to any language restrictions

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.000
and it wasn’t his place to tell&nbsp;
people how to express themselves.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.520
I was curious what he’d do&nbsp;
when he started seeing clients.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.200
Unlike Zane, I’d already found a work placement

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.320
in a therapy centre and I&nbsp;
recounted some of the language

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.960
used by my own clients in recent sessions.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.640
Hearing the words he flinched in disgust.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.600
I asked him how he thought clients&nbsp;
would respond to his disapproval.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.840
Did he think they’d keep coming?

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.480
After a long pause, he changed the subject.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.560
Despite the intensely&nbsp;
introspective nature of the course

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.520
Zane showed little self-reflection

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.320
and remained a disruptive presence to the end

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.120
interrupting and sabotaging exercises

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.000
to assert his petty personal preferences

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.520
in the name of self-care.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.480
For individuals like Zane

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.040
exercising self-care translates&nbsp;
to demanding care from others

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.320
expecting everyone else to forego

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.080
their freedoms and entitlements

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.080
for the comfort of one individual.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.440
Instead of attempting personal growth

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.840
they expect the world to shrink.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.840
Targets of abuse and&nbsp;
manipulation are often trained

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.840
to stay perpetually on the defensive;

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.560
to always be ready to give&nbsp;
convincing justifications

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.120
for any action or lack of action

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.520
any word spoken or unspoken

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.000
any belief or thought expressed or unexpressed.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.520
As part of recovery, targets are&nbsp;
encouraged to reject this interrogation;

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.000
to acknowledge that where&nbsp;
their actions and beliefs

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.800
don’t impose on anyone else’s basic freedoms

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.400
they have nothing to justify.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.120
They don’t have to explain themselves.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.160
Predictably, this self-affirmation&nbsp;
is abused by some individuals

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.920
to try and deny accountability.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.320
For many abusers

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.600
no matter how vicious or&nbsp;
destructive their behaviour might be

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.400
the idea of being answerable to people they regard

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.600
as inferior and subordinate is insulting.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.720
Again, the way this statement is used

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.480
by targets and abusers illustrates&nbsp;
their different orientations.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.000
Targets use it to assert their equal freedoms.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.520
Abusers use it to gain special licence.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.440
And again, some of the most extreme examples

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.120
are found in religious scripture.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.880
As mentioned earlier, the god character depicted

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.080
in the stories of the Bible was a fickle figure.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.080
Even its most obedient&nbsp;
followers were savagely abused

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.800
like the blameless god-fearing Job

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.600
whose children were murdered and who was stripped

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.920
of his health and property&nbsp;
as a test of his devotion.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.400
When the devastated Job had the audacity

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.440
to complain about the callous&nbsp;
destruction of his life

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.080
he was subjected to one of the most&nbsp;
drawn-out narcissistic rants in the Bible

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.440
— chapters full of the god character&nbsp;
boasting about its amazing divine powers

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.360
including a bizarre section listing the many ways

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.000
it could dominate a sea monster called leviathan.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.766
The message is clear.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.320
The god character doesn’t have to explain itself

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.160
not because it has nothing to answer for

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.040
but because it’s more powerful than Job.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.960
This is the definition of totalitarianism.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.600
To defend this tyranny

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.320
analogies are often made with parents

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.000
who sometimes behave in ways

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.360
that might superficially&nbsp;
appear mean to their children

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.880
but that’s only because they’re&nbsp;
too young to understand.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.000
The obvious problem with this defence

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.240
is that abusive parents

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.600
— who are deliberately mean to their children —

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.760
can use exactly the same line:

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.360
‘You’re just too young to understand’.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.440
So how do children distinguish between

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.840
apparently mean and actually&nbsp;
mean and protect themselves?

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.600
According to the ‘just too&nbsp;
young’ argument, they don’t.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.520
They just have to take it&nbsp;
— until they’re old enough

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.360
to figure out they were abused.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.840
The ‘just too young’ argument&nbsp;
is massively overstated.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.120
The fact that children are asking a question

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.920
is a sign they’re ready for some kind of answer

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.120
even a partial one.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.400
We don’t need to overwhelm them with information.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.760
We can hand it to them a piece at a time,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.040
pausing to see if they’re&nbsp;
satisfied — or ready for more.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.040
To give them nothing

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.320
— to angrily dismiss their attempts&nbsp;
to understand as Job was dismissed —

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.560
is to leave them to fill in the blanks

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.160
with very predictable&nbsp;
child-like fears and misgivings.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200
Would any loving parent want that?

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.920
Would any loving god want that?

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.120
One of the most basic methods we use

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.560
to help distinguish apparent&nbsp;
meanness from actual meanness

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.400
is to give individuals the&nbsp;
opportunity to explain themselves.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.120
Whether it’s in domestic&nbsp;
life, at work, in criminal law

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.800
we understand there are&nbsp;
sometimes surprising contexts

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.480
behind destructive behaviour.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.480
We often extend each other&nbsp;
a presumption of innocence.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.800
But that presumption has limits.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.080
If someone refuses to offer a&nbsp;
mitigating account for a destructive act

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.760
we don’t just presume an innocent&nbsp;
motive and drop the issue

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.280
If we did, anyone charged with a crime

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.360
could simply refuse to explain&nbsp;
themselves and they’d be free to walk.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.280
Destructive acts have to be accounted for

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.960
whether they’re human or divine.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.000
In the absence of any explanation

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.920
the act is all we have to go on.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.520
And it’s on that basis that&nbsp;
we have to form our judgement.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.160
Humans or gods who refuse to explain themselves

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.800
are entirely responsible for the judgements&nbsp;
made about their destructive acts.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.840
Abusive relationships are&nbsp;
often full of projection.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.200
Targets are routinely accused of harbouring

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.680
beliefs, desires, schemes and&nbsp;
motives they don’t possess.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.760
Their abusers are just projecting&nbsp;
their own fantasies onto them

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.760
reflecting the abusers’ own&nbsp;
hang-ups, ignorance and vanities.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.840
On the flip side, when&nbsp;
targets confront their abusers

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.000
with accurate negative perceptions

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.160
they’re accused of projecting their own issues.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.960
Self-affirmation work&nbsp;
involves separating ourselves

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.640
from other people’s fantasies.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.040
Sometimes easier said than done.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.080
Abusers often deliver their projections

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.200
with such forceful unshakeable conviction

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.480
some targets privately wonder if&nbsp;
maybe there’s some truth in them.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.040
There’s nothing wrong in wondering that.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.880
Quite the opposite.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.520
It shows you’re open to hearing critical feedback.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.760
Without that openness, we can&nbsp;
never get to know ourselves.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.400
And getting to know ourselves is crucial

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.040
if we’re ever to separate&nbsp;
the truth about ourselves

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.400
from the fantasies about us.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.000
In my first introductory course to therapy

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.320
a great instructor called Jenna

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.840
articulated her approach to&nbsp;
receiving critical feedback.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.680
She said, ‘If you tell me&nbsp;
something critical about myself

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.480
‘that I don’t recognise, I’ll&nbsp;
hold it with me for a time.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.240
‘Reflect on it. See if I&nbsp;
can see what you’re seeing.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.440
‘If I find there’s some truth in what you say,

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.120
‘I’ll gratefully take it on board.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.360
‘You’ve taught me something about myself.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.640
‘But if I find there isn’t any&nbsp;
truth, then I’m looking at you.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.760
‘And I’m wondering what issues you have

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.840
‘that you’re trying to offload on me.’

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.160
Of course we don’t need to reflect long and hard

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.240
on every bit of critical feedback we get.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.280
When people claim the reason for my atheism

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.600
is that I’m angry with their gods

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.160
I know instantly they’re wrong.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.640
I feel no more anger towards their gods

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.480
than I do towards vampires, gorgons, wendigoes

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.280
or any other unsubstantiated mythical character.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.080
People make this false charge&nbsp;
of anger for various reasons.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.600
Some just can’t conceive of individuals&nbsp;
not believing in their gods.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.880
Some are just brainlessly parroting the charge

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.400
they’ve seen other people making.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.800
And of course some are&nbsp;
playing very deliberate games

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.560
trying to irritate and provoke.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.160
But whatever their reason, in every case

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.960
I immediately know they’re talking rubbish.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.200
Because I know that part of myself.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.840
The Johari window is a tool used to reflect

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.520
on the parts of us that&nbsp;
are either known or unknown

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.440
to ourselves and others.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.640
Named after its creators,&nbsp;
Joe Luft and Harry Ingham

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.320
it divides the individual into four basic areas.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.200
The ‘open’ or public self is the part of us

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.400
that’s accessible to everyone&nbsp;
—&nbsp;ourselves and others.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.800
Its opposite, the ‘unknown’&nbsp;
self, is the part no one knows.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.280
It contains elements that may&nbsp;
or may not emerge at some stage

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.360
but for the time being fail&nbsp;
to register with anyone

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.720
— including ourselves.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.000
The ‘unaware’ self is the part of us

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.320
that others can see — but we can’t.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.200
This part contains a mix of elements

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.320
including aspects of ourselves we&nbsp;
just haven’t bothered to look at

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.720
but also aspects we actively distort or deny

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.960
because they don’t fit with our self-image.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.720
Finally, the ‘private’ or hidden&nbsp;
self is the part known only to us.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.080
This part’s also been called the ‘façade’.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.880
But that carries associations of deception

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.280
and privacy doesn’t entail deception.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.240
Self-awareness work reduces&nbsp;
the unaware and unknown parts

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.760
bringing them into consciousness.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.440
Cultivating self-awareness isn’t easy.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.120
It demands rigorous honesty,&nbsp;
openness and integrity.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.360
We might not appreciate some of&nbsp;
the parts of ourselves we discover.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.520
They might arouse powerful resistances.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.160
Which is why self-awareness&nbsp;
work is often most effective

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.640
in neutral or supportive environments

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.000
where our defences are more relaxed.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
The more work we do in this area

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.720
the more realistic our self-image becomes

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.560
the more we immunise ourselves&nbsp;
against false fantasies

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.560
from others or ourselves.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.840
We can’t force self-awareness on each other.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.560
It’s something we have to want for ourselves.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.400
Many people are irretrievably invested&nbsp;
in some idealised fantasy self

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.440
and they’ll continue to project their shortcomings

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.840
onto others until the bitter end.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.960
But as targets get to know themselves

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.920
those bogus projections will&nbsp;
begin to simply fall off them

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.159
like water off glass.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.160
‘Unless we resolve things, none of us will heal.’

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.080
This statement ticks lots of positive boxes.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.280
It suggests a far-reaching concern&nbsp;
for everyone’s mental health.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.080
It acknowledges the existence of issues

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.480
and affirms the need to sort through them

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.240
if any progress is to be made

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.040
not just sweep them unresolved

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.120
under the rug and forget about them.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.080
And it seems to reflect a&nbsp;
lateral egalitarian orientation

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.280
calling for peaceful cooperation and coexistence.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.760
In some cases of substantial ongoing hostilities

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.640
— including civil and sectarian conflict —

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.040
these sentiments are very real.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.600
There’s a genuine intention to&nbsp;
work together to address grievances

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.320
and restore previously eroded principles

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.000
of responsibility, self-control, justice.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.440
But sometimes this statement has&nbsp;
nothing to do with cooperation.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.600
Many targets hear it after&nbsp;
ending an abusive relationship

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.840
or when they’re walking out the door.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.440
Their abusers realise the threats that&nbsp;
once kept them in line no longer work.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.800
So in a last-ditch effort to exert some influence

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.360
they dangle therapeutic concepts

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.600
like resolution, healing, closure, unity.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.760
Sometimes this message is&nbsp;
delivered by someone else

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.640
a family member, mutual acquaintance

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.720
or some other misguided individual

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.520
who’s been roped in to act on the abuser’s behalf.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.440
Targets are sent letters and emails

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.160
trying to plant insecurities in their minds

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.080
suggesting if they don’t come&nbsp;
back and try to work things out

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.080
they’ll be forever haunted by guilt

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.320
plagued by obsessive thoughts

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.160
unable to move on.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.960
They’re told running away isn’t a solution

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.400
they’ll just carry the same&nbsp;
problems around with them

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.640
and none of their relationships will succeed.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.200
Some targets even hear this kind of&nbsp;
doom-mongering from their therapists.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.360
I strongly advise targets who do to get new ones

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.160
who’ve been trained in abusive relationships

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.840
and know what they’re talking about.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.160
One of the many insidious myths about abuse

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.360
is that to resolve our feelings and experiences

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.440
we need our abusers’ participation.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.200
We don’t.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.360
And that reality is born out&nbsp;
by countless targets of abuse

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.200
who heal and move on with&nbsp;
no input from their abusers.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.440
Targets generally have all&nbsp;
the information they need

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.160
— often an overabundance of it.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.600
Resolution isn’t about getting more information

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.320
but processing the information&nbsp;
they already possess.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.440
All the questions they have about their abuse

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.840
— all the whys and the hows —

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.560
are generally ones they can answer themselves.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.400
Their abusers have no valuable insights to offer

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.400
and their participation just opens&nbsp;
the door to more manipulation.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.760
And, just as targets don’t need&nbsp;
their abusers’ participation to heal

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.400
abusers don’t need their targets’ participation.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.040
Just like targets, abusers have&nbsp;
all the information they need.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.880
If they really want to heal,&nbsp;
no one’s stopping them.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.920
When it comes to self-affirmation

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.760
targets and abusers are&nbsp;
divided by a common language.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.520
Targets who use it to restore equality

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.560
find themselves in conflict with abusers

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.200
who twist it to demand special treatment.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.560
It can catch targets off balance

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.400
having their own therapeutic concepts&nbsp;
and phrases used against them.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.840
This kind of disorientation is common

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.280
in the bizarro world of the&nbsp;
abuser where nothing matches up.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.840
Words don’t match actions.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.480
Image doesn’t match content.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.840
Targets need to cut to the underlying issue:

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.640
are everyone’s freedoms and&nbsp;
entitlements being acknowledged?

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.320
The answer to that question will clarify

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.280
whether the person is making&nbsp;
healthy reasonable demands

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.641
or weaponising self-affirmation.
