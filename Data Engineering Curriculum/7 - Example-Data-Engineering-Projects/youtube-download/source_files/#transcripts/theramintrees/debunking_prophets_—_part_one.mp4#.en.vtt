00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.680
In a reported exchange with a theologian,
biologist John Haldane was asked:

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.020
‘What inference might one draw about
the nature of God from a study of his works?’

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.360
Haldane replied, ‘An inordinate fondness for beetles.’

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.160
—&nbsp;referencing the fact insects
are the most abundant animal group

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.219
and there are more kinds of beetle
than any other insect.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.040
Haldane’s reply might seem facetious, but
it makes a serious point:

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.080
trying to infer the nature of supposed gods by studying the universe leads to random nonsense.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.980
Imagine an unknown artist produces a work of art.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.740
What can we conclude about
the artist from the artwork?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.240
Well, in order to know something about the artist,
we have to correctly interpret the artwork.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.760
If we use our own personal interpretations,
we’ll&nbsp;just be learning about ourselves,&nbsp;not the artist.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.780
The problem becomes clear.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.960
To correctly interpret the artwork,
we have to know something about the artist.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.860
We’re stuck in a loop. To know about one
thing we need information about the other.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.800
Likewise, if we hypothesise that the universe
has some mysterious creator

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.620
then to know something about that creator,
we would have to correctly interpret its creation.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.600
But that demands we first know
something about the creator.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.460
Without any of this information, all we have
are the wild speculations Haldane alludes to.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.940
For every observed fact about the universe

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.720
like the number or beetles, or the number of stars

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.250
if we presuppose the existence
of some creator that intended it to be that way

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.922
when we try to speculate on what those
intentions might’ve been

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:56.860
there are just too many conceivable interpretations.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.740
For example, take the fact that countless animals
die in fear and agony every day

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.539
mostly to feed other animals.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.480
Does that mean this hypothesised creator
is a sadist that enjoys bloodsports?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.840
Or a detached experimenter,
observing this suffering without emotion?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.560
Or a breeder, throwing life forms into deadly competition with each other to breed the ultimate organism?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.300
Is this creator just some cosmic pyrotechnician that sees the universe as a giant fireworks display

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.680
and views the lifeforms that fleetingly exist
among the sparks as nothing more than bacteria?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.040
Or could it be unaware that these animals even exist?

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.680
Could it even be unaware that the universe exists?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.100
What if the universe was merely the unintended byproduct of a completely different creation?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.940
Without any indication of intended purpose  to all this suffering, we’re stuck in endless conjecture.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.340
Wild as these speculations are,
they’re at least logically coherent.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.540
Concepts of creators that are sadistic or simply unaware of our suffering might not inspire or uplift us

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.940
but they are consistent with the ruthless gladiatorial animal world in which we find ourselves.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.660
This is in striking contrast to the self-contradicting
divine concepts found within organised religion.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.580
Bizarre concepts like all-merciful gods that
shun children born outside of marriage, along

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.100
along with all their offspring
down to the tenth generation

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.680
or that vow to brand the noses of folks
who dismiss its existence as a fairytale.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.740
Mercy is defined as compassion or forgiveness towards someone we have the power to punish or harm.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.280
Vengeful gods that condemn people for natural scepticism or for the circumstances of their birth

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.200
are by definition not all-merciful.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.960
It’s no surprise that the logically coherent
concepts and the self-contradictory concepts

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.620
were generated by very different processes.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.620
While the coherent ones were inferred,
the contradictory ones were merely asserted

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.420
confidently, forcefully stated as the truth

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.260
by people called ‘prophets’ who make
the most extravagant claim

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.780
— a claim of access to special knowledge,
denied to the rest of us

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.120
— knowledge imparted through
unverifiable mystical revelations.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.200
These are the human beings
who design the world’s religions

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.540
the storytellers who generate all the unsubstantiated, contradictory detail we hear about gods

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.980
— the detailed rituals, the detailed mythical histories,
the detailed lists of bizarre, unjust laws.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.080
Without prophets, our thoughts about gods
would be as shapeless and detached

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.040
as our thoughts about pixies or elves — and would
arouse just as little conflict and division.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.960
Instead, throughout history, prophets have provoked hostilities with the same supremacist message

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.580
condemning those who don’t believe
their stories as a subhuman underclass

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.060
and commending followers as the chosen elite.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.260
I want to look at a handful of prophets

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.220
— some obscure, some famous —

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.620
and explore the holes in their stories.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.600
But first, a brief word about self-reflection.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.660
Bogus ideologies of all kinds

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.780
—&nbsp;religious, political, economic, social —

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.960
can hook us in by force.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.770
Examples range from childhood indoctrination
to forcible ideological conversion in prisons.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.580
But sometimes we get hooked in because
of some unfulfilled need within us.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.160
It could be a need to feel secure,
to feel superior, to achieve social change

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.220
or something more ambitious like
a need to believe in an afterlife.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.600
Sometimes, when a bogus ideology comes along
that promises to satisfy these needs

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.640
we’re so focussed on getting our needs met
that we don’t bother to properly examine that ideology.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.620
And just like a hungry fish that doesn’t
examine the hook before biting, we get reeled in.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.400
Immunising ourselves against manipulation
begins with reflecting on our own needs

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.020
and finding healthy ways to meet them.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.660
When we do that, we might even find
that some of our needs are false.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.720
For instance, we might find we don’t actually need to
feel superior,&nbsp;or to believe in an afterlife.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.740
In the first of five examples of bogus prophets

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.980
I want to show what we stand to lose
when we entrust our needs to these individuals.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.520
Dorothy Martin led a small UFO religious group

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.840
that achieved a measure of publicity in the US

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.280
when she claimed that ‘superior beings’ 
from a planet called ‘Clarion’

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.760
had predicted an apocalyptic flood, before
the dawn of the 21st of December 1954.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.140
Her particular stunt was automatic writing

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.040
—&nbsp;scribbling messages with a pencil and
claiming her hand had been guided by spirits.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.440
Her first message —&nbsp;a letter from her dead father to her mother about planting flowers in the spring —

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.060
wasn’t well received. Her mother told her
to stop inflicting this  upsetting nonsense on her.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.980
But soon Dorothy was claiming to
scribble messages from spiritual beings

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.020
from unknown planets called Clarion and Cerus.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.140
One spirit, called ‘Sananda’, was later identified
as the Christian Messiah, Jesus.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.380
Dorothy herself later claimed to be his mother, Mary.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.540
The Sananda messages were often
phrased in archaic English

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.500
typical of the King James Bible,
using terms like ‘thee’ and ‘thou’.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.320
No one questioned why Jesus would communicate with 20th-century Americans using 17th-century English.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.440
Would we communicate with 20th-century
Germans using 17th-century German?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.320
This archaic language made no sense whatsoever coming from such an immeasurably wise being.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.480
But it made perfect sense
coming from a fraudulent prophet

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.600
who wanted her phoney messages to sound
Biblically grand, profound and authoritative.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.600
Like the Bible, Dorothy’s messages discouraged thinking, which she claimed had ‘no advantage’.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.699
Instead, she advocated ‘inner knowing’, which she said was achieved by believing the creator’s words.

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.380
Here, I’ll repeat one of life’s rules

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.120
which could well be enough by itself
to immunise us from prophets:

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.520
People who don’t want you to think
are never your friend.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:51.640
Whatever the context —&nbsp;religion, politics, education
— not thinking opens us up to all kinds of abuse.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.240
Dorothy’s public announcement of the end of the world attracted over thirty followers

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.490
with eight described as heavily committed.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.780
In addition, some observers recruited by psychologist Leon Festinger and his colleagues

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.240
infiltrated the group to record its activities.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.840
In a surprise development, one follower — a former beautician called Bertha Blatsky —

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.920
claimed she could channel Sananda too,&nbsp;with her voice.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.340
Festinger’s observers described
a faltering first performance

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.970
reporting that ‘empty phrases,
tediously repeated, came from her mouth’.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.240
But Bertha soon got her act together.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.980
In the next meeting, she upgraded herself
from Sananda to ‘the Creator’.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.340
And, speaking as ‘the Creator’

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.280
she proclaimed herself to be ‘the greatest prophet 
.... who ever was or ever will be’.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.520
Her authority was undermined
when, in her ‘Creator’ persona

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.460
she tried to demand an obligatory group meeting

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.080
but was forced to reschedule
by a member who couldn’t make it.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.860
Imagine, the creator of the universe having
to bow to human availability.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.600
In a later meeting, she further asserted herself.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.200
Speaking as the Creator, she ridiculed the archaic English of Dorothy’s messages

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.960
dismissing words like ‘thee’, ‘thou’
and ‘shalt’ as a waste of time.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.300
She belittled Dorothy’s Sananda’s character

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.960
and dismissed his supposed message
about Dorothy being Mary.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.700
And Bertha dismantled other ideas and practices
Dorothy had established, like the value of fasting.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.820
Bertha enjoyed her food.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.200
Dorothy must’ve realised the problem.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.160
She’d previously told the group that a spirit message
had confirmed Bertha’s leadership role.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.460
If she denounced Bertha as a fake,
that would undermine her own claims.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.120
She’d failed to appreciate
a basic principle of prophethood.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.380
Prophets are lone wolves.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.638
They seek to establish their own vision
and don’t play well with others of their kind

00:09:38.638 --> 00:09:42.200
—&nbsp;not even when they’re claiming to represent the same gods.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.500
The two women were locked in an awkward alliance.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.520
But whatever their differences, while
channelling their respective mythical entities

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.840
both women urged group members
to make significant sacrifices

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.180
— including quitting jobs and neglecting sick relatives.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.110
Members also drove for miles
to witness UFO landings and alien visitations

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.300
predicted by Dorothy that never materialised.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.120
These futile exercises were explained as spiritual trials.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.840
In everyday terms, waiting for something
that’ll never happen is called ‘wasting life’.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.399
Prophets present it as a noble struggle
called ‘testing faith’.

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:22.260
Finally, the 21st of December arrived.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.840
The group was told it would be taken up in a flying saucer before the flood killed the rest of humanity.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.400
They cut all the metal from their clothes,
including zips and bra straps

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.480
which they were told would produce burns
during space flight — and waited.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.720
After several uneventful hours

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.420
Dorothy scribbled a message saying
the Creator had cancelled the apocalypse

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.420
— supposedly because their little group
had generated a force of good

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.320
not seen since the beginning of time on Earth.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.320
It was a laughable explanation.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.760
One prominent, committed member,
Dr. Thomas Armstrong

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.740
had explicitly stated he wasn’t
interested in saving the world.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.300
Two other members — Cleo and Kitty —

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.660
were heard concocting vengeful
‘fantasies of violent destruction’

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.080
and anticipating ‘having the last laugh’
as the non-believers drowned.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.300
This was plainly not an unrivalled force of good.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.080
Nonetheless, the group swallowed
Dorothy’s implausible message.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.340
Aside from just one member who departed,
the rest were described as jubilant.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.740
Their commitment strengthened.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.680
The fact that their faith was reinforced
by a failed prophecy might seem absurd to us.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.760
But we’re looking at it from the outside

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.960
with zero personal investment.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.520
Dorothy’s followers invested everything.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.260
They lost jobs, savings and property.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:44.280
They neglected relatives,
ended relationships, even shredded their own clothes.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.340
Get people to make sacrifices for a person or a cause

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.820
and they’ll instinctively try to justify those sacrifices.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.320
The bigger the sacrifice, the greater the need to justify it.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.200
Dorothy’s followers had to cling
to the idea they’d saved the planet.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.980
The alternative was unthinkable.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.060
This UFO religious group is a wake up call

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.000
for the rest of us to look at the sacrifices
we make for the groups we belong to

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.840
– not just religious groups, 
but political and social groups.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:19.720
Sacrifices of time, money, education,
career, relationships, integrity, freedom.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.320
What implausible stories might we accept without
question to justify our investment in these groups?

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.420
Faced with evidence of deception in
our own groups, would we listen?

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.040
Could we admit to being deceived?

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.200
Or, like Dorothy’s followers, would we
find ways to deny reality?

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.380
To admit we’ve invested
in a bogus cause takes courage.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.420
To give it up and walk away takes strength.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.000
But to remain in denial could
cost us everything we have.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.300
In her thirst for esoteric knowledge,
Dorothy Martin once joined a ‘Dianetics’ group.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.240
Dianetics was a commercial self-improvement
pseudoscience based on a process called ‘auditing’

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.080
in which people respond to various
questions and commands.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.740
It was popular in the US just after World War II
and formed the basis of Scientology.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.640
Its inventor, Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, claimed
it cleared the human mind of trauma.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.700
In this state of ‘Clear’, people were
claimed to gain remarkable powers

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.380
including total recall and mastery over all illness.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.800
Lafayette told his literary agent Forry Ackerman that
he’d died on an operating table during the war.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.480
Rising up in spirit form, he’d wafted
incorporeally through a great ornate gate.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.940
On the other side, he’d found
an intellectual smorgasbord —

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.020
the answer to everything that had ever 
puzzled the human mind.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.700
Like a sponge, he absorbed this esoteric information.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.480
Lafayette claimed he’d been
given a message for humanity

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.860
and over the next two days,
he recorded it in a manuscript called ‘Excalibur’

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.540
—&nbsp;but claimed that whoever read it either
went insane or committed suicide.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:01.520
On the grounds that it was ‘too potent’, Lafayette planned instead to publish it in diluted form.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.020
The result was his book Dianetics.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.020
He proclaimed it ‘a milestone for man
comparable to his discovery of fire

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.780
and superior to his inventions
of the wheel and the arch’

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.970
and told one of his wives that he had high hopes
of smashing his name ‘so violently into history’

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.320
that it would ‘take a legendary form
even if all books were destroyed’.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.240
But in August 1950, his confidence was dented
by an incident at the Shrine Auditorium

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.120
recorded by journalist Russell Miller
in his book ‘Bare-faced Messiah’.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.320
Riding high on the sales of his Dianetics book,
Lafayette announced the world’s first ‘Clear’ —

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.460
a woman claimed to possess fantastic powers including ‘full and perfect recall of every moment of her life’.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.920
With the words ‘Will you come out now please, Sonya?’

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.240
he invited physics major Sonya Bianca
on stage to huge applause.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.600
She gave a speech in praise of Dianetics.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.700
But the audience didn’t want speeches.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.820
They began shouting questions
to test her perfect memory.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.482
What did she have for breakfast on
a specific date years ago?

00:14:57.482 --> 00:15:00.300
Could she recite passages from the Dianetics book?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.260
At one point, when Lafayette was facing away from her

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.580
she was asked what colour tie he was wearing.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.380
She had no answers.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.940
She couldn’t even remember simple physics formulas.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.940
Audience members began laughing and walking out.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.040
Instead of opting for a conventional excuse
like stage fright

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.020
Lafayette claimed bizarrely that by using
the word ‘now’ when he’d asked her to come out

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.760
he’d frozen Sonya in ‘present time’, blocking her memory.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.460
A power you could neutralise with a three-letter word didn’t seem quite so remarkable.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.320
Her total recall was a total sham.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.840
And, based on his other claim of mastery over illness

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.280
Lafayette was accused
of practicing unlicensed medicine.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.420
Within a couple of years, Dianetics
had morphed into Scientology

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.700
with Lafayette repackaging his
pseudoscience as a religion.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.900
He brought machines similar
to lie-detectors called e-meters

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.980
into the auditing process to check subjects’ reactions.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:58.300
And asking for proof was declared
a suppressive act, a punishable crime.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.480
Lafayette now brandished the prophet’s
weapon of choice: blasphemy laws.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.060
When individuals or groups start to shut down
and prohibit criticism and challenge

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:16.080
it’s about the biggest possible warning sign 
—&nbsp;in any context. Religion. Politics. Education.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.340
It signals the onset of totalitarian systems.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.140
Stick around and you can
wave goodbye to successive freedoms.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:29.940
And with each freedom you give up, you can watch yourself regress into a powerless, compliant child.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.400
Former Scientologist and author Jon Atack
has noted how members were bullied

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.120
berated, pushed around, and had
their self-control taken from them.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.940
Fortunately, his own instinct when shouted at was
to shout back — not realising he wasn’t meant to.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:51.660
This adult defiance seems to have been a key factor
in his resistance to the group’s undue influence.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.580
In over 60 years, Scientologists have failed
to demonstrate a single case

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:02.380
of total recall, mastery over illness or any other ability.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.620
But, unable to ask for proof

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.540
thousands of members have
collectively paid untold millions of dollars,

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.400
putting themselves through untold hours of auditing

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.360
in the hope of gaining the elusive state of ‘clear’.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.980
Decades after it was written

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:22.620
the supposedly lethal Excalibur manuscript
was unearthed by Lafayette’s staff.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.340
His household manager,
Gerry Armstrong

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.380
reported that he managed to read it
without going insane or dying.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:33.960
Accompanying documents also revealed that there
was no operating table death episode.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.809
Lafayette’s revelation was a hallucination

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:41.560
induced by nitrous oxide
inhaled during a tooth extraction.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.560
Mormonism was conceived in the 1820s by
a young American called Joseph Smith

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.220
who claimed an angel called Moroni had told him about
a book of golden plates buried in a nearby hill

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.080
along with two special stones called
Urim and Thummim.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.880
Joseph enlisted a wealthy farmer called Martin Harris

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.300
to participate in the bizarre process
of translating the plates

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.180
which were claimed to be
an extension of the Christian Bible.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.920
Joseph would put the stones in a hat, and
hold the hat to his face, blocking out the light.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.400
He claimed passages of text
would then appear before his eyes

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.100
which he would dictate for Martin to transcribe.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.480
Joseph always kept the plates hidden.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.000
Sometimes a blanket or curtain
would be hung between him and Martin.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.590
Magic stones were nothing new for Joseph.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.920
Before venturing into the prophet business,
he’d tried his hand at money-digging.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:38.300
Using exactly the same stone-in-a-hat routine, he
claimed he could detect buried treasure.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.840
In those times, buried treasure was
often thought to be enchanted.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.400
Some believed that if forbidden treasure was unearthed, the spirits could make it sink down again out of reach.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.800
Money-diggers could pretend to dig up treasure

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.620
then claim the treasure had been reclaimed by spirits

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.000
—&nbsp;and still pocket their fee.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.800
Martin Harris’s wife Lucy didn’t
believe the gold plates story.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.340
To appease her concerns

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.540
Martin asked Joseph if he could show her 
the 116 pages they’d so far produced.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.860
Joseph later told him that their god,
Elohim, had denied his request.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.460
But Martin kept asking

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.160
and after his third request

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.760
Joseph said Elohim had granted permission to show
the pages to his wife and a few relatives.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.540
Martin took the pages
and showed Lucy and several others.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.300
Then the pages were stolen.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.580
If the golden plates story had been true,
losing the pages would’ve been a very minor setback.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.120
It wasn’t as if they contained top secret material.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.220
It was a new Christian testament —

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.120
supposedly a divine message intended for everyone.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.760
What did it matter if some thief
or thieves got a sneak preview?

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.220
The only real problem would be having
to translate the golden plates all over again

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.300
repeating work already done.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.160
There’d certainly be no reason to panic.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.820
But if the story was false

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.880
and Joseph had made the whole thing up

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.700
losing the pages would be a catastrophe.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.620
And that was exactly how Joseph reacted.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.880
According to his mother,
on hearing this news

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.000
Joseph wept and groaned and
cried out repeatedly that all was lost.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.080
With no master template to work from

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.620
the lost pages couldn’t be reproduced.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.520
If he tried to dictate them from memory

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.440
Martin Harris was bound to notice inconsistencies.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.040
In addition, the thief or thieves
could produce the stolen pages

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.040
at any time after the book was published
and show the translations didn’t match.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.740
After a period of reflection

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.920
Joseph announced that Elohim
had instructed him not to go back

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.320
and translate what he’d already translated.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.680
He said Elohim had told him that the thieves
had altered the stolen pages

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.700
so that if Joseph tried to replace them

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.860
the thieves would use their false version
to claim he’d contradicted himself.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.360
People would then turn against Joseph.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.300
He claimed Elohim just wanted him
to carry on where he’d left off.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.280
It was a story full of holes.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:58.440
Problem one, there was no scenario in which
it was in the thieves’ interest to alter the stolen pages.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.640
If they believed Joseph had made the whole thing up

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.200
then they’d be expecting his second
translation not to match their stolen copy.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.520
Altering their copy would be the last thing
on their minds.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.500
Alternatively, if the thieves believed Joseph
could produce another perfect copy

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.980
that meant they either believed
his magical golden plates story

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.400
— in which case, they believed
they were up against Elohim himself —

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.600
or they believed Joseph had some
other master version to refer to.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:30.340
If Joseph had a master copy, altering the
stolen pages would be pointless and risky.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:35.019
Pointless because Joseph could
reproduce endless copies of the 116 pages

00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:38.140
to prove he wasn’t just
making the textup as he went along.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.080
Risky because when the new pages
were compared with the stolen pages

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.860
the portions the thieves had altered
would come under special scrutiny

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.920
being the only parts that differed.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.700
Any sign of tampering would only
strengthen Joseph’s position.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.820
Altering the pages made no sense.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:22:00.060
Problem two, an all-knowing Elohim would’ve
known all along that the pages would be stolen,

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.660
and that Joseph would ultimately
not translate them again.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.240
The supposed authors of the golden plates were&nbsp;the prophet Mormon

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.610
and his son, Moroni, who had
visited Joseph in angelic form.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:16.570
So, Elohim watched silently as the equivalent
of 116 pages of English text

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.340
was laboriously engraved in gold, all for nothing.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.540
Problem three, the omnipotent Elohim
is portrayed as strikingly impotent.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.820
He can arrange angelic visitations

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.920
reveal the secret whereabouts of magical golden plates

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.460
make text magically appear through a stone in a hat.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:42.660
But can’t locate some bits of paper, or tell Joseph
who stole them, or magically destroy them

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.280
—&nbsp;any of which could remove
the threat against Joseph

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.060
and restore the value of
Mormon and Moroni’s hard work.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:55.740
Astounding how useless the gods suddenly become
the moment any practical help’s required.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.120
Problem four.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.040
Elohim seems aware of how damaging
it is to have his prophets suspected of deceit.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.980
So why did he choose Joseph Smith as a prophet —

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.440
knowing his future deceit would become
a matter of public knowledge?

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.820
When Joseph’s Book of Mormon was eventually
published, it contained some troubling problems.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:18.460
One example was a passage copied verbatim
from the King James Bible.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.160
The trouble wasn’t just that it was an exact copy.
It was that both versions contained the same error.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:29.300
The authors of the Kings James Bible
had written ‘seraphims’ instead of ‘seraphim’.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:34.360
Just as cherubim is the plural of cherub, 
seraphim is the plural of seraph.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.760
If Joseph was translating from the
golden plates, how could this happen?

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.720
One Mormon apologist suggested that when the
handwritten manuscript went to the printers

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.700
the typesetter might’ve noticed that the
passage was from the Biblical book of Isaiah

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.300
and decided to work from the printed
King James version to ‘ease his task’.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.760
But that’s not a workable solution.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.200
On reading this suggestion

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.500
I did some research to see if Joseph’s original
handwritten manuscript was available.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.760
It was.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.640
And it contained the erroneous ‘seraphims’.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.720
The Book of Mormon contained
a stack of similarly damning problems.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.800
But there was worse to come.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.440
In the mid-1830s

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.000
some Egyptian papyri unearthed around 1820
came into Joseph’s possession.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.780
From them, he produced The Book of Abraham

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.500
commonly considered the most important text in
a Mormon canon called the ‘Pearl of Great Price’.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:33.100
But it was later discovered that the papyri were
actually just standard Egyptian funerary texts

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.020
like the Book of the Dead and Books of Breathing.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.220
They had nothing whatsoever to do with Abraham.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:43.440
Joseph’s translation was an unequivocal fraud.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.320
In their concern to impress
the people of their own time

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.820
bogus prophets often exhibit great short-sightedness.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.740
It seems Joseph Smith had no inkling of
the huge strides that would soon be made

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.600
in the translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.780
How have Mormons responded to this
irrefutable deception by their prophet?

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:08.860
Some have minimised the deception, characterising it
as a sincere but misguided invention.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.900
Some have downplayed the book’s significance
because it wasn’t translated from the golden plates.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.580
Some have suggested the papyri could be legitimately
read as both an ancient funerary text

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:23.980
and the Book of Abraham — even though they can’t
map the Book of Abraham onto the hieroglyphics.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:30.560
Some have suggested the papyri merely provided ‘an occasion for meditation, reflection, and revelation’

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.680
in which Elohim revealed
the life of Abraham to Joseph

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.420
without direct correlation
to the characters on the papyri.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.140
Earlier I asked a question

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:45.120
about the implausible stories we might
find ourselves accepting without question.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.740
In these denials and evasions

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:53.880
we see human minds determined to protect
themselves from a profoundly painful fact.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.920
As with Dorothy Martin’s followers

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:02.260
their personal investment  has made the truth of
their prophet’s deceit literally unthinkable.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:07.059
In the concluding half of this two-part series,
I’ll be looking at two more famous prophets,

00:26:07.059 --> 00:26:12.100
and drawing together some observations on
all of these undeserving oracles.
