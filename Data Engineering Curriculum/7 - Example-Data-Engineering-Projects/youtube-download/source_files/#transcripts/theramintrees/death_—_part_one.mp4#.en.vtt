00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.239
Over the last few months, I've been
approached several times about the

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.609
subject of death,

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.460
including a tag by the wonderful Largo64, and the glorious Rozeboosje,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.730
enquires about psychological studies,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.379
assertions that I'm 'pro-mortality',

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.910
questions about my responses to some
thought-terminating cliches,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.070
and about my personal outlook.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.050
I've always been fascinated by how we
cope with death --

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.330
or more interestingly how we fail to
cope with it,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.950
with all the destructive consequences
those failures bring.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.050
It's also had some personal residence
for me recently.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.950
It feels the right time to share that I
started experiencing throat problems a few

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.360
months ago that wouldn't go away.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.220
When I reported the symptoms,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.950
the doctors immediately suspected an
aggressive type of cancer that one of my

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.820
brothers died of, and I was rushed
through a series of tests.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.909
I recently received the results of those
tests.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.110
My condition is benign.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.909
Given this temporary stay of execution, I
thought I'd address all of these

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.109
solicitations in two videos,

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.680
dedicated to death.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.049
But before I begin,

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.060
I'd like to invite you to take a moment
to consider your personal reaction to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.000
these videos about death --

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.819
your reactions as you watch them

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.020
and also before you started watching,
when you saw they were available.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.790
What with the thoughts and feelings that
came up for you?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.130
Were they positive?

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.980
Negative? Mixed?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.700
Blank?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.759
I'd invite you to hold these responses
in mind

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.110
and, if it feels ok,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.420
perhaps share some of them.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.750
We have a lot to deal with in this experience
we call life don't we?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.610
At the most basic level, we're faced with the
physical challenges of survival:

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.610
finding and competing for food,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.630
water, shelter,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.270
and -- if we so inclined --

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.640
sexual partners,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.560
while distancing ourselves from diseases,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.649
parasites,

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.530
predators,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.209
natural disasters.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.549
On the social level, we find ourselves
within a species containing huge

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:16.760
variation.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.830
We must determine the significance of
these differences -- if indeed there is any --

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.779
and find our own place within this
variety.

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.250
On the psychological level

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.849
we wrestle with all kinds of unknowns,

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.090
unpredictabilities,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.709
ambiguities, dissonances.

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.829
We live with swathes of unanswered
questions:

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.129
questions about the universe we find
around us,

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.289
and the one we find inside us:

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:44.379
our own mind, with so many of its
processes blocked out of our awareness.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.619
Perhaps the most profound paradox we
experience comes when we bring the

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:52.179
universe and the mind together -- as the
meaningless meets the meaning-hungry.

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:56.429
Within that paradox, the task we seem to
find most intimidating of all is

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:58.389
the business of confronting death.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.309
We can infer that level of intimidation
by the extreme lengths we employ to deny

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:03.289
death.

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.100
Extreme protected lengths,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.510
employing a range of physical and
psychological barriers to block

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.229
the fear out,

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:13.859
and extreme aggressive lengths,
dehumanising, attacking and killing those

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.189
who face us with our fears.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.329
We witness and experience all kinds of
disproportionate emotional responses in

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.159
life.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.870
An example familiar to us all is phobias.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.150
For the phobic individual, there's a
sizeable mismatch between the perceived

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.000
and actual levels of threat associated
with the phobic object or situation.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.370
As a child, I was arachnophobic. I ascribed a
quasi-human intelligence to

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.729
the spider's stealthy behaviour,

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.560
and imagined that its goal was to get
into my mouth.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.769
I never questioned why it might want to do
that.

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.359
But that's the self-preserving nature of
fair -- it facilitates irrational

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.149
fantasies and pseudo-explanations that
maintain the fear,

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:55.589
while simultaneously diminishing our
capacity for the kinds of rational

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.949
processing that might break its hold.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.849
One of the saving graces of phobias is that they're generally owned by the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:02.909
individual.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.379
As that arachnophobic child, I didn't go round thinking everyone else was

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.549
wrong not to have a spider phobia.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.359
I knew the problem was mine.

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.620
But there are other kinds of
disproportionate emotional responses

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.339
where ownership of one's own fears aren't so easily accepted.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.249
As a child coming up to 14,

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:21.979
about to announce my departure from the
religion into which I'd been

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.110
indoctrinated,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.719
I actually expected a positive reaction.

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.219
Having spent months in private thought,
trying to justify my belief in that

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:30.010
religion,

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.140
it dawned on me:

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.430
every magical being so far had been
hoaxes played by the adults.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.700
I kicked myself for spending so much time working through the arguments and I looked forward

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.580
to having a laugh with the adults when
they found out I'd seen through this

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.380
religion hoax too.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.969
My announcement of non-belief was
greeted with rage,

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.030
contempt and punishment.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.909
When the fatwa was declared on
Salman Rushdie in 1989,

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.930
I initially dismissed it as a prank.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.189
Appealing to worldwide followers to
implement a death sentence

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.779
just for writing a novel?

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:05.599
I'd never heard anything so pathetic and
ridiculous â€” but Khomeini's decree was

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:06.400
genuine.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.839
Such homicidal theocracies actually
existed.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.559
Ten years ago, a muslim friend of mine
shared that her nephew had come out to her

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:14.590
as a homosexual.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.410
She told me that if their family found
out, he'd be taken to India and

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.400
buried alive.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.710
Furthermore, if her family found out that she
knew and hadn't told them,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.000
the same would happen to her.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.830
Five years ago, when I first heard of the
anti-atheist hate widely promulgated

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.970
across the US, I thought it had to be
some big national joke.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.229
Some trendy,

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.360
ironic, faux-prejudice.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.460
When I realised it was serious,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.249
I joined the discourse.

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.860
My focus back then was purely on the
prejudicial aspects, rather than debating

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.360
the existence of gods.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.199
But in response to simply revealing my atheism

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.330
I received death wishes,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.360
death threats,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.419
suggestions that I was already dead

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.319
spiritually -- and of course salivating
references to my perpetual living death

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.580
in hell.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.969
Talk about overkill. But I recognised some of
my own stuff here too.

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.759
At age 12, when I was an active
christian, a religious education teacher

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.949
asked me why I believe what I believed. The
question seemed innocuous enough at

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:14.009
first.

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.080
But as I reflected on it, I realised nothing valid was coming to mind.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.229
An appropriate response would've been to simply admit that.

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.949
My actual response?

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.359
I wanted that teacher wiped from the
face of the planet.

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:31.179
What drives these extreme reactions? What's
the big deal?

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:34.759
Were the believers here any less free to
believe whatever they wanted?

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.919
Divine beliefs are generally claimed to
bring inner peace -- but what kind of inner

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.900
peace is it that demands that other
people get their inner peace the same way ....

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.029
or else!

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.189
Clearly in each of these cases,

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:50.240
with such hyper-aggressive defences
being mobilised,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.879
the aggressor was protecting something
tremendously fragile.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.229
Emerging out of the cocoon of religion,

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.429
the big deal for me was death --

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:02.389
realising that there was no reason
whatsoever to believe I'd be reborn,

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:03.539
reincarnated,

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:08.120
resurrected or reconstituted in any way
after my physical demise --

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.479
let alone reunited with loved ones in
some sugary hereafter.

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.659
It quickly occurred to me that this was of
course the prime psychological function

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.039
of the part of our culture we label
'religion':

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.069
to deny death.

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:25.919
To reject the unthinkable thought that
when our brains stop,

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.029
we stop.

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:30.759
We have a host of other cultural
props and mechanisms explicitly designed to

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.470
help us deal with the passing of friends
and family:

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.129
ceremonies where we can share our
feelings;

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.429
professional services to help us process
our bereavement;

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:43.189
dedicated locations we can visit to
keep our memories alive.

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:45.960
But for many of us, these things just aren't enough.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.039
The pain of fully letting go

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:49.789
feels unendurable.

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:50.860
Added to which,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.210
if we admit the finality of our loved
ones,

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.110
we're implicitly faced with our own
finality.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.430
In this state of denial, we seek out illusions

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:05.409
that offer a promise of perpetuity.

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:09.619
On the physical front, there's not much
scope for illusions of perpetuity --

00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:12.249
corpses wreak of finality.

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:16.009
In the initial stages, while they still
maintain some semblance of the living state,

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:20.049
we might just about be able to
sustain some fantasies consistent with

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:21.270
natural processes --

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.909
for example that the person's merely
sleeping.

00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:25.880
But when the decay really kicks in,

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.209
the evidence of finality is just too
uncomfortable.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:30.650
To deny death,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.580
we turn to the non-physical -- to the
realm of symbolic thought.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.600
Our capacity for this kind of thinking has
led us to entertain a multitude of

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.730
figurative forms of immortality.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.710
Some folks see themselves preserved in
their children.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.290
Some folks pursue their own individual
fame or power as a buffer against extinction.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:52.020
Some devote themselves to
influential figures, or invest themselves

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.910
in a group they feel to be emblematic of
their own values.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.170
Impersonal cultural institutions like
the law offer a sense of order and

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.079
protection,

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:05.040
diminishing our awareness of disorder
and vulnerability.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.380
Architecture, built to spend many
lifetimes, provides a huge reinforcement

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.660
of symbolic permanence. But our ultimate psychological alchemy came when we

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.580
managed to convince ourselves our
symbolic self could exist outside

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.110
our literal self.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.000
We called it a 'soul'.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.750
Once humans had committed this violation,
there was really no end to the

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.249
possibilities on offer.

00:09:26.249 --> 00:09:28.829
The soul could be reborn in another body --

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:30.419
perhaps another species.

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:32.880
It could be reinserted in the same body.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.140
It could even simply continue with
nobody at all.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.069
On the face of it, the concept of the
independent soul

00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:43.040
would seem to provide enough denial to
keep everyone happy.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.340
So why isn't everyone happy?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.740
The problem with illusions is that they're devilishly difficult things to maintain.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.810
Not only do they constantly run up
against reality -- they're also vulnerable to

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.419
competing illusions.

00:09:55.419 --> 00:10:00.559
Group A denies death with a fantasy in
which the soul departs to a paradise or

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:02.000
realm of torture

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.960
after one physical life.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.120
Group B denies death with a fantasy in
which the soul just keeps getting

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.380
reincarnated on Earth.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.390
When these fantasies meet

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.930
there's gonna be a clash.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.890
The existence of the competing illusion
serves as a constant contradiction to

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.870
the other --

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.070
undermining its death-denying capability.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:26.050
It soon becomes clear that, in order to keep a death-denying illusion going, everyone has

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.770
to believe the same thing.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.400
Over the years, I've noticed a range of
strategies to reduce the threat of

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.340
conflicting ideas.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.170
They might simply be dismissed as
ridiculous, implausible,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.610
maybe primitive.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.300
But however much we try to dismiss
conflicting ideas psychologically,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.860
it's much better if they're just not there at all.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:49.200
History's festooned with aggressive
proselytisation programmes,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.340
where one death-denying illusion is displaced by another.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.980
Sometimes the poison's sweetened by the
addition of medical aid,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.399
or enhanced educational prospects,

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:02.970
supporting the aggressors' delusion that
they're 'helping the savages' -- rather than

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.890
eliminating the competition.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.460
History also abounds with the more
violent step up from that,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.970
when members of the competing death-denying illusion are exterminated.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.309
Where dismissal, proselytisation or
murder seen non-viable,

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:18.750
we have the truce.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.360
Here parties focus on common aspects
between the illusions,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.319
while trying to downplay the threatening
differences.

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:28.119
Some folks have tried this with christianity
and islam

00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:30.160
saying it's the same god.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.739
Problem is, it isn't the same god

00:11:32.739 --> 00:11:34.750
The god that gave its only son

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.139
in explicit reference to a purported
original sin

00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:40.650
is not the god that had no such son.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.790
This is not a minor detail that can be
discarded.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.980
It informs the whole rationale for the
belief.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.399
And beneath all the magnanimous gestures
towards inclusion,

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:52.930
multiculturalism and pluralism,

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.580
these differences are not forgotten.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.010
The inherent supremacism of the individual's ideology merely moves from

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:00.840
overt

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.060
to covert.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.570
And when things get rocky,

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.190
that supremacism is quick to surface.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.860
Out come the flags, the icons,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.609
and the feverish assertions

00:12:10.609 --> 00:12:13.110
of monoculture.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:17.830
Truces have an elastic limit. Finding
common ground gets harder as differences

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.120
between groups increase. When confronted
with groups who have no divine beliefs

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.839
at all, it is of course possible to offer a truce based on human values.

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:31.440
But that tacitly acknowledges the redundancy of divine beliefs.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.180
Hence

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.450
strategy number five: emotional blackmail.
Here, folks attempt to coerce those who

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:42.130
don't share their illusions into silence
by evoking guilt or fear.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.720
Sometimes the blackmail his preemptive.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.140
The blackmailer lets it be known publicly
that they couldn't bear it if anyone

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.080
confronted their illusions.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.390
Other times, the blackmail's reactive.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.870
The blackmailer tries to stifle any further
challenge with the same manipulative

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.920
methods --

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.040
casting folks who expose their illusions
as cruel,

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.370
destructive and heartless --

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.290
hoping they'll be persuaded to mask their
dissent.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.800
Whatever the strategy, the goal is the same.
Unable to withstand scrutiny or challenge,

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.150
the poorly constructed illusion can only survive by blocking

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.960
them out.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.420
Having reflected on this death denial
over several years, it was intriguing to

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.790
come across experimental support last
year, when my friend Tim introduced me to

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.980
the work of Sheldon Solomon, Tom Pyszczynski

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.700
and Jeff Greenberg --

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:35.700
the proponents of 'terror management
theory'.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.199
Sheldon Solomon explains:

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:41.120
'If culture serves a death-denying function

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.320
then if you remind people that they're going to die,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.860
that should momentarily .... increase the
need for the death-denying aspects of

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.910
their particular beliefs about reality --

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.470
and that should be reflected by their
reactions to other individuals, who

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.860
either bolster or support those beliefs,

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.079
or who undermine those beliefs by either
being hostile to them,

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:00.370
or merely different from them.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.250
The terror management team have
conducted scores of studies to

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.529
investigate this

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:07.350
'mortality salience hypothesis'.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.300
In a study into attitudes, two groups
of christian subjects were asked to

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.520
fill out a questionnaire, ostensibly about
how people form impressions of others.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.650
The questions in one group were specifically phrased to remind the reader

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.980
of his or her own death.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.900
Both groups were then asked for their
impressions of two fictitious students

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.100
who shared personality traits.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.589
One student was a christian.

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:30.030
The other was jewish.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.510
Subjects who'd been reminded of their own
death gave an especially positive

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.510
assessment of the christian and an
especially negative one of the jew.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.500
The subjects who weren't reminded of their death showed no preference.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.440
Another study investigated the effects
of mortality salience on behaviour,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.990
looking at subjects' willingness to use
cultural symbols and icons in

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.830
inappropriate ways.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:55.399
In the first of two tasks, subjects were
given a variety of objects

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:59.430
and asked sift sand from a jar with
water and ink.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.190
The American flag was the only object that would do the job.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.790
In the second task,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.560
subjects had to hang a crucifix on the
wall -- but in order to do that

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.530
they had to use the crucifix to bang the
nail in.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.980
Subjects who'd been reminded of death in
a prior questionnaire

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.550
took twice as long as those who hadn't.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.690
The researchers also looked into the
effects of mortality salience on

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.790
subjects' choice a political candidate,

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.940
using campaign statements expressing
three different leadership styles.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.290
The task-orientated leader's statement
emphasised high but achievable goals

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.330
implemented through efficient resourcing
and delegation. The relationship-orientated

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.029
leader's statement focused on
respect, compassion, trust,

00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:41.209
communication

00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:42.910
and appreciation.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.420
The charismatic leader's statement alluded to
the nation's greatness

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.620
and stressed the importance of vision and
group identity. Initially, only 4%

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.790
voted for the charismatic leader,

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.120
with the remainder fairly evenly split
between the other two.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.119
But when subjects were reminded of death,

00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:03.170
votes for the charismatic leader
soared to 33%.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.130
Interestingly,

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.140
votes for the relationship-orientated statement fell sharply.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.810
The researchers noted how these results
echoed George Bush's rise in popularity

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:17.020
around the 9/11 attacks, with his
appeals to the nation's greatness and

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.179
righteous war against the axis of evil.

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:23.629
In a subsequent experiment, the
researchers found that reminders of both

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:28.140
mortality and 9/11 significantly increased support for Bush --

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.160
not just among conservatives

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.550
but also liberals.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.260
As the researchers pointed out, we
should be extremely concerned

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.300
at how easy it is to manipulate an electorate's political preferences through

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.970
appeals to a combination of nationalism
and fear.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.770
While it's natural to fear legitimate threats, we'd do well to keep some

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:51.930
rational perspective and demand facts, rather
than allow ourselves to be seduced by

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.990
heroic, fear-based rhetoric.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.430
In this video, I looked at the illusions we construct to deny death

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.900
and how they lead to divisive and
disproportionate emotional responses

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.330
to folks who don't share those illusions.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:13.450
In the second video, I'll be exploring several
other grave subjects, including the label

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:18.410
of 'pro-mortality atheist', the demands of immortality, the claim that there are

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.440
'no atheists in foxholes', and the
possibility of peace of mind without

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.680
recourse to illusion.
