00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.850
The course tutor asked us all to imagine

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.710
our client had turned up late to therapy

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.730
claiming the trains were disrupted.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.040
She invited us to suggest other possible reasons
for this lateness.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.730
One student suggested it could be an act of
passive aggression.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.540
Maybe the client was angry with us.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.500
Another student suggested
it might be a self-worth issue.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.400
Some clients don’t feel they deserve to
have any time spend on them.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.620
Someone else suggested the client might be
scared of personal change

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.020
and their lateness could be an unconscious
attempt to sabotage the therapy.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.860
These and other speculations about the client’s
ulterior motives

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.640
all received an approving nod from the tutor.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.200
When the suggestions ran dry

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.060
I added what seemed an obvious final reason:

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.740
Maybe the trains were disrupted,
just like the client said.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.260
The tutor frowned and said, ‘No.’

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.640
She said we always had to assume the client
had some motive.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.520
I was mystified. I said trains do get delayed.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.300
Cars do break down.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.980
Sometimes things happen outside of our control
to make us late.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.180
But she dismissed the point and repeated

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.660
that we always had to assume personal motives.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.940
I said when we assume personal motives that
might not exist

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.020
we risk attributing our clients with imaginary
issues they don’t possess.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.520
That’s not assisting them — that’s actively
adding to their problems.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.300
The tutor suddenly threw her hands up
and shouted:

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.840
‘If I don’t assume my clients have unconscious
motives I can’t work with them!’

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.060
I said of course she could work with clients
without making assumptions.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300
I said she could just openly
check out with them

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.780
whether there might be other reasons behind
their lateness.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.540
She could ask how they were feeling about
the therapy sessions.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.700
Give them an opportunity to discuss

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.000
any reservations or concerns in an open way.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.580
But it was crucial to be open to the idea

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.580
that their excuses for being late
could be genuine.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.080
I reminded her of a sentiment
often attributed to Freud:

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.220
‘Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.’

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.420
Sometimes things are just what they seem

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.300
with no hidden meaning or symbolism.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.500
She sat in silence for a long time,
gazing at the wall.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.860
People in the group looked at each other bemused

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.940
wondering what was going on with her.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.920
Finally she turned back to the group
and moved on to the next exercise.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.040
As if nothing had happened.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.920
It was just another in a series of jarring
outbursts by various staff members

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.660
on a therapy course I attended
a few years ago.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.980
I was already a qualified therapist
at the time

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.600
and I’d taken the course purely to build
on my existing experience.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.320
Other students who hadn’t yet qualified
had more at stake.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.780
Around a third of the group ended up leaving
the course

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.840
in response to continued misconduct and ethical
violations by the staff.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.440
We were repeatedly directed
to diagnose our clients

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.740
with bogus psychological issues.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.620
Despite zero medical training,
staff directed us

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.500
to assume our clients’ physical illnesses
were purely psychosomatic

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.349
and to keep clients in therapy at all costs

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.020
even when they indicated
they were ready to end.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.860
We were told to warn them against the dangers

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.690
of leaving therapy prematurely

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.120
and falling back into old destructive patterns.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.900
When students disputed
the training centre’s practices

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.780
staff members suggested
they had psychological issues

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.840
that they should discuss with a therapist.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.540
The place was rife with imaginary defects.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.540
Of course it’s part of everyday life

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.400
that we sometimes get accused of having flaws

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.360
without any good evidence.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.160
But in certain arenas, these accusations pack
more of a punch.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.790
Therapy’s one.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.540
Religion is another.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.760
The manipulations found in the realm of religion
are nothing special.

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.769
They’re just more highly structured

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.240
and cloaked in a sense of untouchability called
holiness

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.760
which is itself a manipulation designed to
silence dissent.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.900
They’re also more magnified.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.580
The same religions that piously condemn gambling

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.989
induce us to gamble our entire lives

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.940
on their unsubstantiated accounts of the universe.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.460
This religious wager extracts immeasurably
more from us

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.260
than a flutter on the horses.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.140
One of the biggest religious hustles

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.700
is to persuade us there’s something implicitly
wrong with us.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.900
Christianity claims we all bear the stain
of the original sin

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.020
committed by the mythical first humans
Adam and Eve

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.960
when they disobeyed the Christian god

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.460
by eating from the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.880
Islam rejects the original sin story of its
Abrahamic predecessor

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.840
but still depicts humans as inherently imperfect

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.080
and emphasises the constant need to atone
and seek divine forgiveness.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.960
Its founder Muhammad outlined various ways
to gain forgiveness.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.460
One involves what’s called the night of
decree or night of power

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.220
that occurs in the fasting month of Ramadan.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.160
Muhammad claimed the Islamic god,
Allah, would forgive

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.120
all the previous sins of people who prayed
throughout this night.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.520
The catch was he didn’t specify
the date it fell on.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.540
Followers were told it was one
of the odd nights

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.420
of Ramadan’s last ten days.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.699
Some Islamic scholars openly admit

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.550
this vagueness about the night of power

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.479
is designed to get people to worship
throughout the month

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.640
in the hope of catching it.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.740
But even the most dedicated worshippers

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.360
can have all their acts of devotion erased
on a whim.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.580
In his book Major Sins

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.650
revered 13th-century writer Imam Dhahabi

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.440
explains the sin of ‘feeling secure from
Allah’s devising’.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.080
He claimed folks who think
they’ve qualified for paradise

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.590
can have their destination
deliberately overwritten by Allah

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.560
when paradise is a mere arm’s length away.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.460
Some apologists say this is just a warning

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.150
to individuals who indulge in sins

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.780
on the assumption they’ll be
automatically forgiven

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.200
if they fulfil their worshipping obligations.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.120
But Dhahabi points to a more far-reaching
interpretation

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.120
that implicates everyone.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.880
Anyone — good or bad — who dares
to feel secure

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.620
about their place in paradise can be made
to sin by Allah

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.590
right at the last minute and sent to Hell.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.539
Dhahabi says Allah can choose to make someone

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.889
agreeable, disagreeable, willing or hateful

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.330
and cites Muhammad’s claim
that a person’s heart

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.280
is held between Allah’s fingers who can
change it whenever he likes.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.220
What’s being encouraged here is a state
of perpetual insecurity.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.760
People are told they’re
psychologically sick

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.150
manipulated into chasing
endless religious therapy

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.639
kept endlessly guessing about whether the
therapy’s worked

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.830
and warned that bad things could happen

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.410
if they dare to think they’re doing ok.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.210
Joseph Smith, founder of the Christian offshoot
Mormonism

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.460
also rejected the Christian story
of original sin.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.039
He said people would be punished for their
own sins

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.120
not Adam’s transgression.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.120
And of course there’s no justice

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.320
in punishing people for the transgressions
of others.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.620
But there’s also no justice
in punishing people

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.560
for things that cause no harm to others.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.200
Just like other religious groups,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.880
Mormonism denounces a range
of harmless activities as ‘sinful’.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.199
Sadly, when religious leaders
label something a sin

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.700
many followers never question whether there’s
a valid basis for that label.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.780
Instead they actively try to justify the label.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.040
Pick any random activity.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.040
Singing. Painting. Using umbrellas. Space travel.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.111
Label it a sin and notice how easy it is

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.260
to find spurious reasons to condemn it.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.400
When we learn to accept spurious reasons

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.980
as a basis for our thinking

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.240
religious leaders can apply the sin label
to whatever they like

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.480
and we fall unthinkingly in line.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.500
Which is how perfectly reasonable, healthy,
positive practices

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.460
become poisoned
with illegitimate guilt and shame.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.880
One area many religions have successfully
stigmatised is sex.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.360
Mormon leaders classify many natural sexual
expressions

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.949
including solitary, same-sex and straight
pre-marital activity

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:24.560
as the gravest kinds of sin.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.800
They even condemn sexual thoughts

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.440
embodying Orwellian thoughtcrime.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.880
Virginity is venerated and non-virgins get
compared to used chewing gum.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.060
Ex-Mormons have reported religious lessons

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.560
in which groups are invited to help themselves
to a tray of cupcakes

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.860
one of which has been openly
licked by the teacher.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.100
When it’s the last to get picked, the point’s
made:

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.460
No one wants spoiled goods.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.780
But does this demeaning analogy stand up?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.940
In a 2016 paper for the Journal of Sex Research

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.740
titled ‘Has Virginity Lost its Virtue?’

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.600
Amanda Gesselman and colleagues found that

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.740
sexually experienced individuals
held more appeal

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.280
as prospective romantic partners.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.320
Even inexperienced individuals preferred

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.560
a degree of experience in their mate.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.250
It seems non-virgins are often perceived as
bigger cupcakes.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.020
Not licked ones.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.180
Of course, the cupcake analogy is a red herring.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.440
Instead of making a moral argument, it just
stigmatises people.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.779
Any activity — good or bad — can be stigmatised.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.540
Immorality isn’t defined by stigma.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.600
Murder and theft aren’t considered immoral
because they’re socially unpopular

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.620
but because they involve identifiable harm.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.680
Without clear evidence of harm

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.880
the case against premarital sex fails.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.960
Manipulative groups often use analogies

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.160
to try and short-circuit our thinking.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.640
But just like fact claims, analogies need
scrutiny too.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.840
Mormon puritanism isn’t only reserved for
pre-marital sex.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.040
In a 1982 letter to its presidents and bishops

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.089
the Mormon office of the First Presidency

00:10:01.089 --> 00:10:02.690
said married couples who were guilty

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.810
of unnatural, impure or unholy practices
including oral sex

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.030
shouldn’t enter the temple before repenting

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.020
and discontinuing such practices.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.780
Other religious leaders have also tried to
interfere with marital sex.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.700
Muhammad condemned anal sex
between married Muslims.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.980
Leaders in the Jehovah’s Witness organisation

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:28.020
initially ruled that oral sex within marriage
warranted expulsion.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.740
It then rescinded this ruling

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.140
conceding these marital intimacies were none
of its business

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.160
— only to make it an expellable offence
again a few years later.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.860
Countless people struggle with unwarranted shame and anxiety

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.300
because of stigmatising religious doctrines.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.040
When people claim you’re defective, don’t
accept analogies.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.890
Don’t accept stigma.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.780
Don’t accept charges of sinfulness.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.180
All these things can be applied to absolutely
any activity.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.280
Ask for evidence.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.660
If evidence isn’t forthcoming,
the discussion is over.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.480
An area of 
life where evidence is available is discrimination:

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.300
the unjust, prejudicial treatment of people

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.360
especially based on group categorisations.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.060
Some discrimination is brazen and unapologetic.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.540
Other kinds are more covert.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.920
As children, many of us learn to recognise

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.620
the sly unspoken subtleties of discrimination.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.340
My parents repeatedly terminated my friendships
with certain children

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.500
but they’d never admit the reason
was skin colour.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.760
Instead they took refuge in insinuations

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.280
labelling my friends ‘unseemly’, ‘not
respectable’ and a ‘bad influence’.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.720
Of course children soon learn
to decode this language.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.700
When funny, warm, polite children are labelled
a bad influence

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.000
doesn’t take long to identify the real issue.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.020
Some time ago, I was told about
a psychological test

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.560
designed to address more covert forms of discrimination.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.620
It was called the Implicit Association Test
or IAT

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.500
and its creators claimed
it measured ‘unconscious bias’.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.860
When I took some of these tests online

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.860
I could see some huge conceptual problems.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.460
When I got my results

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.040
I noticed the creators included a disclaimer

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.860
stating these weren’t definitive assessments.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.380
But months later, I was disturbed to discover

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:30.000
the IAT was already being used in workplace
diversity training packages.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.040
The term ‘unconscious bias’ has two very
distinct usages.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.480
One simply refers to observable behaviour

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.500
that lies outside our awareness.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.560
For example a teacher might favour

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.460
some students over others
without realising it.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.320
Here, we can show people
evidence of their bias

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.980
giving them a chance to understand and address
the problem.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.700
The second usage refers to bias

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.780
that lies outside the person’s awareness

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.900
and for which there’s no observable evidence.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.279
When people don’t experience biased thoughts

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.380
or display biased behaviour

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.029
allegations of bias become a matter of faith

00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:06.130
leaving people unable to understand

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.860
or address the supposed problem.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.060
The IAT comes under this second usage.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.800
The IAT is a reaction time test.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.900
It takes a single human characteristic

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.130
like skin tone, sexuality,
gender, weight, age

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.100
and splits it into two categories.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.000
For example, age is split into young or old.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.339
Subjects have to categorise various images
and words

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.460
as fast as they can using two keys on a keyboard.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.399
In some trials images of young people and
good words

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.680
are assigned to one key

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.900
and images of old people and bad words to
the other.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.860
In other trials, young people and bad words
are assigned to one key

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.760
and old people and good words to the other.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.200
Faster reaction times to certain pairings

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:57.200
like old people and good words

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.440
are taken as an indicator of unconscious bias
in that direction

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.180
and a predictor of real-world discrimination.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.940
Two crucial concepts
underpin psychological tests:

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.420
reliability and validity.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.980
Reliability concerns a test’s ability
to produce consistent results.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.500
One type of reliability
called test-retest reliability

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.640
looks at whether people who take the test
twice show consistent results.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.160
The highest reliability score is 1.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.060
The lowest is zero.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.240
A value of .8 or higher shows a good level
of reliability.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.380
The creators of the IAT have put its test-retest
reliability at between .5 and .6.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.920
They’ve acknowledged this poor reliability
risks high rates of error.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.260
If our goal is fair treatment

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:48.630
then classifying people as biased or fair-minded

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.560
when they’re not is going in exactly the
wrong direction.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.380
Validity concerns whether a test measures
what it claims to measure.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.100
The IAT’s creators claim
the test measures attitudes.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.100
But, as researchers have pointed out

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.620
even if it measures psychological associations

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.600
which is questionable in itself

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.380
associations aren’t equivalent to personally
endorsed attitudes.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.980
They might simply reflect
an awareness of stereotypes.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.720
The creators further claim the test predicts
real-world discrimination.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.360
But even they admit to
an extremely low correlation of 0.24

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.880
between the race IAT and discriminatory behaviour.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.600
In 2017, a team of practitioners in psychiatry
and emergency medicine

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.800
reviewed various studies in which the IAT

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.620
was used to investigate bias among physicians.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.200
Of the nine studies reviewed

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.360
seven found no influence on clinical decision-making.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.680
The other two showed confounding results.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.870
For example, Alexander Green and colleagues

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.840
found physicians who scored low on race IAT

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.320
indicating low bias

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.460
showed a big disparity
in their treatment decisions.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.060
They were far more likely to offer

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.519
a certain effective coronary disease treatment
to black patients

00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:58.380
than they were to white patients.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.160
Meanwhile, high scorers on race IAT

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.240
predicted to show pro-white bias

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.120
treated both groups roughly equally.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.940
A 2012 Psychological Science paper by Jacquie
Vorauer

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.420
found that subjects who completed a race IAT

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.760
behaved cautiously in subsequent intergroup
interactions

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.180
limiting their self-disclosure, and seeming
potentially unfriendly or aloof.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.600
These kinds of anxieties and conflicts
are predictable

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.120
when people are told
they have psychological flaws

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.740
without being given any sound evidence.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.160
They’re left in an overly vigilant state

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.200
second-guessing all of their responses.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.800
Discrimination is not imaginary.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.860
It exists in overt and covert forms.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.480
But demonstrably unreliable tests
like the IAT

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.120
which generate false predictions about discrimination

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.920
only serve to muddy the waters.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.700
We’ll always find people
suggesting we’re flawed.

00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:56.680
But in certain areas of life

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.140
like therapy, religion and the workplace

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.520
those suggestions can carry undeserved authority.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.770
When we’re given observable evidence of
harmful behaviour

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.000
then we have something to explore

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.500
but not when we’re faced with mere stigma
and assumptions.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.400
There’s no reason to entertain
imaginary defects.
