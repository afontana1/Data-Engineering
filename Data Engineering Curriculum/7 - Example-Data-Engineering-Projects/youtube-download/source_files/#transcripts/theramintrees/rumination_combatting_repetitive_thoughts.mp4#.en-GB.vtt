00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.910
For lots of people who experience abuse and trauma

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.350
— from religious to occupational to domestic —

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.140
a common symptom they wrestle with is rumination:

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.719
perpetually dwelling on their experience.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.829
This symptom can last for weeks, months, sometimes years.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.260
I want to explore this psychological trap

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.990
and look at various ways of extracting ourselves from it.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.510
In broad terms, rumination is defined

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.350
as the process of thinking deeply about something

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.380
or the product of that thought.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.592
And in ordinary circumstances, there’s no
harm in this kind of immersive reflection.

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:17.100
We use it to acclimatise to new information
and situations

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.470
for example in bereavement, where thinking
intensely and repeatedly

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.409
about what we’ve lost allows us to adjust
to the new reality.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.740
We use rumination to make complicated plans
and solve problems.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.780
It can help us overcome the errors we often
fall into

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.030
when we rely on more simplistic emotionally
driven reflex thinking.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.659
The biases, the prejudices, the habitual mental
shortcuts we take

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.799
that cloud and distort complex realities.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.200
In its positive form, rumination can lead
to insight and progress.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.689
It’s the morbid form that leads to problems

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.539
when we find ourselves circling endlessly
and unproductively

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.140
around negative thoughts, images,
mistakes, encounters.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.539
Like a deeply scratched vinyl record we skip
back to the same position,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.057
looping round the same groove, never moving forward.

00:02:13.714 --> 00:02:18.609
Frida constantly replays memories of an abusive
relationship.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.450
She recalls various scenes from the relationship

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.290
and imagines herself responding differently

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.180
shouting back angrily and standing her ground.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.930
Whole afternoons, evenings, nights can be
swallowed up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.620
internally rehearsing a single incident that
lasts barely a minute

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.579
and that Frida’s revisited countless times before.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.190
Roger frequently experiences nightmarish thoughts

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.420
of a magical realm of eternal torture that
he was told existed after death.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.329
As a child, he was fed vivid fantasies

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.410
about the terrible punishments awaiting people there

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.169
like being starved and taunted with food they
couldn’t reach

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.639
or being made to jump off high cliffs

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.370
then having their smashed bodies restored
just so they could jump again.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.157
Forever.

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:15.919
Roger was told that he was born with a sick nature and deserved this torture

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.949
and that his only hope of escaping it was
to beg forgiveness

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.282
for his imperfect thoughts and imperfect actions.

00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:29.340
Only after his death would he learn if he’d
done enough grovelling.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.070
Since childhood, Roger’s struggled to meet

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.000
the paralysing expectations imposed on him

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.850
brooding incessantly on his shortcomings

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.150
obsessing over possible negative consequences
to his actions

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.629
fearing the forbidden thoughts that could
flash uninvited into consciousness at any moment.

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:52.591
Joni lives far away from her abusive father.

00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:55.609
That distance and her hectic work life

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.380
have given her a plausible excuse
to minimise contact.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.410
She only sees him at large family events where
she can avoid being alone with him.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.549
The one form of contact she still struggles with

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.166
are the letters they continue to send each other.

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:15.680
Seeing one of his arrive, her body will flood
with adrenaline.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.100
She’ll open it with shaking hands.
Reading it, the world will disappear.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.090
Nothing else will exist but his words

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.850
which will seesaw between pathos
and unbridled persecution

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.699
one moment piling on frailty and vulnerability
with a trowel

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.752
the next firing savage accusations at Joni,
scapegoating her for his problems.

00:04:38.752 --> 00:04:42.314
The letter will preoccupy her for days.

00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:47.930
These ruminations leave Joni, Frida and Roger
feeling churned up

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.672
disconnected from their lives and stuck firmly
in the past.

00:04:52.672 --> 00:04:58.774
The irony is that for all three of them
rumination began as a coping strategy.

00:04:58.774 --> 00:05:03.470
For many people, rumination seems to offer
some kind of comfort at first.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.820
For Roger, who would experience huge spikes
of panic and anxiety

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.220
in response to some perceived shortcoming

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.960
rumination would initially have a dampening
effect on his emotions.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.620
As punishing as it felt, dwelling on thoughts
of worthlessness

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.790
gave him a degree of psychological shelter
from the sharper feelings.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.970
But eventually, raw from his compulsive mental
self-flagellation

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.090
he would trade anxiety for depression.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.690
For Frida, who’d felt like a powerless doormat
in her past relationship

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.151
reimagining herself as the angry victor made
her feel powerful for a while.

00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:46.471
The anger was intoxicating — and addictive.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:51.460
And she would rehearse her fantasies over
and over to sustain the high.

00:05:51.898 --> 00:05:54.814
As she became aware of the hours slipping by

00:05:54.814 --> 00:05:59.399
She’d start promising herself the next repetition
would be the last.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:02.750
And she would repeatedly break that promise.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.860
Unable to stop herself, she would gradually succumb

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.492
to feelings of intense powerlessness.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.710
For Joni, who would feel immobilised by her
father’s letters

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.260
rumination would initially offer her
an illusion of hope

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.220
that maybe this time she’d think
of a game-changing response

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.164
that would set them on a different track.

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:27.460
But for every idea that came to mind

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.934
she’d see how he could twist it against her.

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:36.170
She knew how a single innocent word could
be loaded with false poison.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:42.669
Slowly, exhausted from futile overthinking,
she would sink into despair.

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.780
Many abused and traumatised individuals
intuitively believe

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.330
rumination is somehow helping them cope.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.057
But the evidence points in the opposite direction.

00:06:53.057 --> 00:06:57.461
Rumination is often the gateway
to much bigger problems.

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:07.460
A substantial body of research suggests that

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.230
far from doing any good,
rumination plays a significant role

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.290
in both the onset and the maintenance of various
mood-related problems

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.108
involving anxiety, stress, compulsions
and depression.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:26.080
Studies have highlighted some of the specific
features of rumination

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.362
that pull us down these pathological paths.

00:07:29.362 --> 00:07:33.290
Investigating the role of rumination in post
traumatic stress disorder

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.590
Tanya Michael and colleagues note that patients
often focus

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.139
on open-ended unresolvable ‘why’ and ‘what
if’ types of questions

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.390
instead of the actual traumatic experience.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.060
Edward Watkins and colleagues have reported
similar findings

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.770
in the areas of anxiety, depression
and impulsive behaviours.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.120
They found a significant determining factor
in the experience of these problems

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.685
was whether the individual engaged in concrete
or abstract rumination.

00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:06.930
Concrete rumination involves gathering clear
discernible details

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.352
observable facts, quantifiable evidence.

00:08:10.352 --> 00:08:14.100
We confine ourselves to what actually happened.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.740
With abstract rumination, we drift away from facts

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.130
and start contemplating questions that have
no definitive answers.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.479
We become preoccupied with possibilities

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:30.770
possible meanings, possible motives,
possible consequences.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.516
The possibilities are endless. And debilitating.

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:40.490
Concrete rumination addresses the specific
context of a situation.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:48.400
If we fail a task, we try to identify the
specific factors that led to that particular failure.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.889
By doing that, we get the chance to learn
from it and move on.

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:56.310
Abstract rumination works
in the opposite direction

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:02.173
removing context and distorting information
into broad generalisations.

00:09:02.173 --> 00:09:07.334
If we fail a task, we generalise it
into a personality trait.

00:09:07.334 --> 00:09:12.000
We become a failure.
We can’t do anything right.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.899
We might also apply generalisations
to other people.

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:18.850
If friends are unable to fit in with our plans

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.160
perhaps because they’re dealing with their
own personal demands or struggles

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.845
we dismiss that context and label them selfish
and uncaring.

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:32.860
Abstract rumination globalises our negative
experiences.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.379
We convince ourselves that something that
happened once

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:41.168
will always be the case
—&nbsp;and has always been the case.

00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:44.129
These distortions prevent us from learning

00:09:44.129 --> 00:09:47.820
and leave us with a sense of hopelessness.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.850
Unlike the more systematic focus
seen in concrete rumination

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.706
with abstract rumination, there’s often
a haphazard butterfly focus.

00:09:56.706 --> 00:09:59.930
Individuals hop around from thought to thought

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.449
from memory to memory, in a disorganised way

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:04.879
never stopping long enough

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:08.273
to see anything through to the point of resolution.

00:10:08.273 --> 00:10:10.860
Because of this vague processing

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.509
past experiences of significantly different natures

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:18.334
get blurred together into false patterns.

00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:25.864
Eventually individuals become overloaded with
unresolved thoughts and feelings.

00:10:25.864 --> 00:10:31.591
Abstract rumination magnifies and prolongs
negative states.

00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:37.511
Like a black hole, it consumes vast amounts
of energy and offers no light.

00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:40.644
Just an expanding sense of darkness.

00:10:41.363 --> 00:10:43.529
To combat abstract rumination

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:47.095
we need to put our thoughts in their proper place.

00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:49.110
Even when we’re not ruminating

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.000
we often give our thoughts quite staggering
power and control over us.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.379
As children, we’re often taught to view
our thoughts

00:10:57.379 --> 00:10:59.509
as reflections of who we are.

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:03.271
We learn to equate our thoughts with our identity.

00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:06.889
Even the most random notions
that pop into our heads

00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:10.922
feel like a comment on our deepest self.

00:11:10.922 --> 00:11:14.696
If uncharitable thoughts cross our minds,
it means we’re wicked.

00:11:14.696 --> 00:11:17.607
Even if we never act on them.

00:11:17.857 --> 00:11:21.190
Some religious groups
push this misconception further

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.773
with the concept of thought crime.

00:11:23.773 --> 00:11:28.230
Merely thinking about doing something becomes
the same as doing it.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.649
Oddly this only seems to apply to bad thoughts.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:36.311
There’s no positive equivalent of thought
heroism for good thoughts.

00:11:36.311 --> 00:11:39.610
Fantasising about giving
vast amounts of money to charity

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.680
isn’t considered the same as doing it.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:49.798
Equating thoughts with actions gives them
a completely fraudulent power status.

00:11:49.798 --> 00:11:54.249
The concept of magical wishes elevates that
status further.

00:11:54.249 --> 00:11:57.629
Now our thoughts make things happen.

00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:00.939
Magical wishes are a source of false hope

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:03.743
and often great anguish.

00:12:03.743 --> 00:12:08.199
Sometimes in a moment of anger we might wish
for something bad.

00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:11.540
When our anger passes, instead of viewing
our wish

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.610
as a momentary expression of mental frustration

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.211
we worry it’s had some physical effect
on the universe.

00:12:18.211 --> 00:12:24.530
In these and other ways, we let our thoughts
push us all out of shape.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.220
Breaking the powerful emotional hold our thoughts
have over us

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.246
means changing our relationship to thinking.

00:12:31.778 --> 00:12:35.069
The concept of ‘distancing’ refers to
the exercise

00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:37.009
of standing back from our thoughts

00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:40.121
and viewing them from a detached perspective.

00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:44.470
John Powers and Kevin Labar noted various
kinds of distancing.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.547
They used the example of feeling hurt
by a criticism from a co-worker.

00:12:49.547 --> 00:12:51.939
We could use objective distancing

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:56.907
imagining how the criticism might be viewed
by a neutral third party.

00:12:56.907 --> 00:13:01.639
Temporal distancing involves imagining the
criticism happened years ago.

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:05.120
With hypothetical distancing,
we’d imagine the incident

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.415
was a theoretical situation instead of a real one.

00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:13.319
Distancing removes us from the emotional impulses
of the moment

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:16.139
that can distort and block our processing

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:19.666
and allows us to consider different responses.

00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:22.879
As we exercise more detachment from our thoughts

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:27.214
we can exercise more choice over which thoughts
we engage with.

00:13:27.214 --> 00:13:29.470
When thoughts pop into our heads

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.290
we often automatically give them
our immediate attention.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.949
If people turned up at our house uninvited

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.139
we wouldn’t automatically let them in.

00:13:39.139 --> 00:13:42.966
We’d ask ourselves: Is it a convenient time for us?

00:13:42.966 --> 00:13:44.949
What are these people here for?

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:48.069
Is it pleasure, business, some emergency?

00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:52.652
We’d decide whether or not we wanted
to invite them in.

00:13:52.652 --> 00:13:56.722
Thoughts are like guests
in the houses of our minds.

00:13:56.722 --> 00:14:00.050
We can choose which ones we open our doors to

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.340
and which ones we decline to entertain.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.660
Just like human visitors who refuse to take
no for an answer

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.619
we might find that some negative thoughts persist

00:14:10.619 --> 00:14:15.019
in trying to push their way in
and get our attention.

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:18.029
In tackling them, it’s important to recognise
the difference

00:14:18.029 --> 00:14:21.500
between resisting them and dismissing them.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.350
There might be a natural temptation to try

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.360
and expel persistent thoughts
from our minds by force

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.657
to try and lock them out with sheer willpower.

00:14:31.657 --> 00:14:35.619
When we do this, we create an internal conflict

00:14:35.619 --> 00:14:39.173
that sets us up for failure and frustration.

00:14:39.173 --> 00:14:41.730
If someone says, ‘Don’t think of a chair’

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.941
what are you most likely to think of?

00:14:44.941 --> 00:14:46.970
When we try not to think of something

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.284
we’re asking some part of our brain

00:14:49.284 --> 00:14:52.329
to keep track of the thing
that we don’t want to keep track of.

00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:57.149
It’s like handcuffing ourselves to something
then trying to run away from it.

00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:00.410
The more defences we put up,
the more frustrated we get

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.689
when the thought continues
to break through them

00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:06.329
the more power we give the thought over us.

00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:11.024
We drift into a fearful position,
dreading its return.

00:15:11.024 --> 00:15:13.829
In contrast, when we dismiss a thought

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:16.360
instead of trying to block it out by force

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.309
we accept that the thought exists

00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:21.929
and simply choose not to give it any energy.

00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:26.809
Some people find it’s useful at the start
to speak directly to the thought

00:15:26.809 --> 00:15:28.060
to say something like:

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.152
‘I acknowledge your existence.
But I have no use for you.’

00:15:32.152 --> 00:15:37.610
Or ‘I know you’d like some of my time.
But not today.’

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.149
Because we’re not working against ourselves

00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:42.704
we preserve internal harmony.

00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:48.439
Because the persistent thought no longer arouses
anxiety or frustration, it loses power.

00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:52.249
And we maintain an emotionally neutral position.

00:15:52.249 --> 00:15:57.908
Eventually, starved of attention,
the uninvited thought will fade away.

00:15:57.908 --> 00:16:00.513
And we won’t even notice.

00:16:01.232 --> 00:16:04.999
Recognising that we can choose which thoughts
we give our attention to

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:08.480
means we always have the option
to simply disengage

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.730
from any persistent negative thought at any time

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.009
and stop rumination in its tracks.

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:18.240
Building on that, I want to look at some ways

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.649
we can help to permanently uproot
negative thoughts

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:26.076
and restore the balance that rumination disrupted.

00:16:31.831 --> 00:16:37.309
In some cases of rumination, our thoughts
don’t correspond to any real problem.

00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:40.589
We’re wrestling with an illusion.

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:43.220
We can end this kind of rumination permanently

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.079
by debunking the hollow idea or belief
that’s kept us stuck.

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:51.699
This involves cultivating our inner lawyer

00:16:51.699 --> 00:16:55.622
and shifting from abstract to concrete processing.

00:16:55.622 --> 00:16:58.589
Roger was tormented by the possibility

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:02.119
of a magical realm of eternal torment.

00:17:02.119 --> 00:17:03.990
His indoctrinators had injected him

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:08.983
with an unanswerable question,
a torturous ‘what if’.

00:17:08.983 --> 00:17:13.361
When zealots ply us
with horrifying magical ‘what ifs’

00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:16.830
we need to be very clear
about what they’re doing.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:22.571
They’re trying to plant an anxiety inside
us that we can’t resolve.

00:17:22.571 --> 00:17:25.578
When we start down the path of what ifs

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:28.901
there’s no end to the available horror.

00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:31.640
Whatever nightmare possibility we imagine

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.110
we can always imagine something worse.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.480
We can always add more horror.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.630
The fear we feel contemplating those what ifs

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.492
isn’t a response to any real danger.

00:17:43.492 --> 00:17:46.559
It’s a response to our own imagination.

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:49.870
Roger’s recovery from rumination began

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.090
when he reined in his imagination
and shifted his focus

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.649
to discernable details and identifiable facts;

00:17:58.649 --> 00:18:02.899
when he changed the ‘what if’ into a ‘what is’.

00:18:02.899 --> 00:18:05.960
The fact was his indoctrinators had never offered

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.133
any persuasive evidence
for a single one of their claims.

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:13.549
They’d simply subjected him to magical fearmongering

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:19.450
let his mind run wild, and in his terror
he’d surrendered his rationality.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:24.059
Now, with rationality restored,
Roger’s inner lawyer

00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:27.980
dismissed their case on the grounds
of total lack of evidence.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.570
While Roger’s rumination was ultimately
based on an illusion

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.996
for many others, the focus of their rumination
is very tangible.

00:18:36.996 --> 00:18:39.413
Like Joni’s father.

00:18:39.413 --> 00:18:42.120
Sometimes we get stuck ruminating on a problem

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.830
because we keep using the same fixed approach.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.210
We need to reframe the picture
—&nbsp;view it from another angle.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:55.320
As noted before, with abstract rumination
we’re often viewing situations

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.220
through a distorting lens of broad generalisations

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.576
when we need to be looking at specific contexts.

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:08.222
In Joni’s case, she assumed everyone was
fundamentally amenable to reason.

00:19:08.222 --> 00:19:12.480
And as long as she continued to view her father
from that fixed angle

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.350
she continued to exhaust herself
trying to reason with him.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.490
Her rumination ended when she allowed herself

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.309
to view him from a different angle

00:19:21.309 --> 00:19:23.741
as someone who wasn’t open to reason.

00:19:23.741 --> 00:19:26.876
From there, everything fell into place.

00:19:26.876 --> 00:19:29.409
Abusers come in a variety of forms.

00:19:29.409 --> 00:19:31.330
Some act like five-year-olds

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.309
often because in some important
developmental terms

00:19:34.309 --> 00:19:37.479
that’s what they are: children.

00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:40.132
Some abusers are like histrionic actors

00:19:40.132 --> 00:19:45.409
generating endless melodramas and casting
themselves in the starring role

00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:49.121
often as some noble unappreciated victim.

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:52.493
Joni realised this was what her father was doing.

00:19:52.493 --> 00:19:55.934
He had no interest in listening to reason.

00:19:55.934 --> 00:20:01.419
He was focused purely on hunting for grievances
to create his dramas.

00:20:01.419 --> 00:20:06.129
When Joni recognised this, she stopped taking
his letters seriously.

00:20:06.129 --> 00:20:09.110
Whenever they arrived, she would read them aloud

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.663
in the style they were written
— like a Shakespearian tragedy.

00:20:13.663 --> 00:20:18.210
Instead of a source of stress, they became
a source of entertainment.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.688
She continued to write back occasionally.

00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:26.317
But kept her replies brief and wasted
no unnecessary thought on them.

00:20:26.317 --> 00:20:28.980
When we get stuck in one perspective

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:34.157
seeing things from another angle
can be a transformative experience.

00:20:34.157 --> 00:20:36.580
Another way to step out of rumination

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.326
is to give our thoughts and feelings some
external expression.

00:20:40.326 --> 00:20:45.419
Many writers say they can never discuss a
project with anyone until it’s completed.

00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:50.844
Talking about it before it’s done takes
away the drive to see the project through.

00:20:50.844 --> 00:20:53.399
They no longer feel the need to tell the story

00:20:53.399 --> 00:20:58.403
because by sharing it with someone it feels
like it’s already been told.

00:20:58.403 --> 00:21:02.330
In the same way, the drive to ruminate often subsides

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.649
when we find some way to get our thoughts
out of our heads

00:21:05.649 --> 00:21:07.539
where they just go in circles

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:10.049
and give them some external expression.

00:21:10.049 --> 00:21:12.606
There are many ways to do this.

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:14.184
Keeping journals.

00:21:14.184 --> 00:21:18.287
Using some creative medium
like&nbsp;painting or music.

00:21:18.287 --> 00:21:21.544
Some people use what’s called the ‘empty
chair’ technique&nbsp;—

00:21:21.544 --> 00:21:23.990
they imagine the person they’re ruminating about

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.350
sitting in front of them in an empty chair

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.759
and say whatever they need to say.

00:21:29.759 --> 00:21:33.539
For some targets of abuse,
writing letters to their abusers

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:37.250
really purges their minds
of a lot of pent-up material.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.840
For people who do choose to write letters,
a word of caution.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.149
Don’t ever send them.

00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:46.169
It’s not about engaging with the abuser.

00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:49.297
It’s just about releasing our thoughts.

00:21:49.297 --> 00:21:52.413
Some people burn or shred their letters.

00:21:52.413 --> 00:21:57.000
Some post them back to themselves.
Whatever works for you.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.170
It’s worth saying something here
about expressing anger.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.320
Anger is an important and valuable emotion.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.110
It can give us strength and motivation
to combat real abuse.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.374
And sometimes we can lose ourselves in it.

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:16.230
Frida’s angry reinventions of past scenes

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.338
with her abuser made her feel strong

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:22.550
but kept her from moving forward.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.809
Her anger made it easy for her

00:22:24.809 --> 00:22:28.741
to see all her problems as someone else’s fault.

00:22:28.741 --> 00:22:32.419
It also prevented her from recognising
and processing

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:36.201
the softer feelings that her anger was covering

00:22:36.201 --> 00:22:39.556
feelings of hurt and vulnerability.

00:22:39.556 --> 00:22:43.980
It was when Frida was finally able to express
her full range of feelings

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.815
that she began to free herself from the past.

00:22:47.815 --> 00:22:52.136
Activity can be a great preventative measure
against rumination.

00:22:52.136 --> 00:22:56.147
Not necessarily in the way
we might intuitively think.

00:22:56.147 --> 00:23:00.000
Some people use activity
as a distraction technique.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.461
But this doesn’t always help.

00:23:02.461 --> 00:23:05.500
Because we’re using activity
as a kind of resistance

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.950
—&nbsp;an attempt to push thoughts away —

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.239
it can end up arousing more anxiety.

00:23:11.239 --> 00:23:15.276
Activity helps to restore balance to our lives.

00:23:15.276 --> 00:23:19.215
Rumination can lead to prolonged
periods of inactivity.

00:23:19.215 --> 00:23:23.000
Preoccupied in our thoughts,
we put off social engagements;

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.451
we fail to plan recharging breaks;
we neglect ourselves.

00:23:27.451 --> 00:23:32.242
We stop doing the things that might help
to lift us out of our mood.

00:23:32.242 --> 00:23:35.850
As days of inactivity begin to mount up

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.715
our rumination becomes self-feeding.

00:23:38.715 --> 00:23:43.687
All we have to look back on are days
of unproductive thought.

00:23:43.687 --> 00:23:48.000
Activity helps to break up
that self-reinforcing pattern.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.529
It gives our days distinctive texture and
stimulates our thinking in other areas.

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:56.090
Again, a word of caution.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.809
When we’re starting to re-engage with activities
after long periods of rumination

00:24:00.809 --> 00:24:04.830
it’s easy to fall into self-defeating
internal dialogues.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.291
We might think to ourselves:
‘This used to be more fun.’

00:24:08.291 --> 00:24:11.496
‘Why am I not enjoying this
as much as I used to?’

00:24:11.496 --> 00:24:14.880
Instead of making negative comparisons
with the past

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.992
just focus on what the activity’s
giving you right now.

00:24:18.992 --> 00:24:22.659
Which brings me, finally, to mindfulness —

00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:25.819
a state of focus on the present moment.

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:29.500
Mindfulness is about becoming aware
of the here and now

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.269
observing our thoughts and our sensory experience

00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:36.705
in a state of detached curiosity.

00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:41.330
Instead of becoming entangled and defined
by our thoughts and emotions

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.940
we watch them come and go without attachment.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.928
We view them as the fleeting
experiences they are.

00:24:48.928 --> 00:24:52.639
If we find ourselves going off into the past
or the future

00:24:52.639 --> 00:24:58.050
we just notice that that’s happened and
bring ourselves back to the present.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.879
If we become aware of any critical inner voices

00:25:00.879 --> 00:25:03.790
telling us we’re doing a bad job of this
mindfulness stuff

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.052
again, we notice it without engaging with it.

00:25:08.552 --> 00:25:11.970
Through mindfulness, we can learn to direct
our attention

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.820
purposefully and calmly
instead of allowing ourselves

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:21.291
to be yanked around passively by random butterfly
thoughts and feelings.

00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:24.720
Research has shown that regular
mindfulness exercises

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.169
can have a hugely positive impact on rumination
and mood disorders.

00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:33.779
Of course there’ll be times in all of our lives

00:25:33.779 --> 00:25:37.325
when we have to face painful
thoughts and feelings.

00:25:37.325 --> 00:25:41.850
Times of conflict and abuse.
Times of loss and bereavement.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.029
And allowing ourselves to feel
the pain of those moments

00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:47.673
is an important part of processing them.

00:25:47.673 --> 00:25:54.000
But if we find ourselves descending into downward
spirals of morbid unproductive thought

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.509
there are measures we can take
—&nbsp;dos and don’ts —

00:25:57.509 --> 00:26:00.553
to halt and reverse that descent.

00:26:00.553 --> 00:26:03.628
And overcome rumination.
