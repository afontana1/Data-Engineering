00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.980
Many targets of abuse wrestle with a desire to fix people in the abusive situation.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.760
Sometimes that desire is directed at their abusers.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:45.700
Targets offer boundless love, reassurance and understanding in the hope of counteracting the abusers' negativity and healing their destructive compulsions.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.520
Sometimes the urge to prepare is directed at other targets, who they hope to rescue from their abuse.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.440
In both cases, individuals can drive themselves to exhaustion trying to mend people they can't mend.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.300
I want to reflect on these attempts to fix people and what causes them to fail,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.340
and explore some more productive focuses.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.639
Might seem odd for a qualified therapist to talk about letting go of fixing people.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.119
Isn't that what therapists do -- fix people?

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.969
Not quite; if clients do get fixed it's because they've worked on fixing themselves.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.309
The therapists role is to facilitate that process of self mending.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.479
It's useful to reflect on what happens in therapy because it illuminates some of the reasons we fail to fix people.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.820
We could think of therapy like this:

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.180
Between where the client is and where they want to be, there's an obstacle course.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.240
Together the client and therapist view the obstacles ahead and consider how to navigate them,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800
assessing the relative risks of different options.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.020
Some are straightforward; some are more involved.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.160
The therapist stays in close contact,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.080
offering an additional perspective and drawing attention to traps the client might not have noticed.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.560
But it's the client who has to traverse the course and work through the issue they've come to address.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.640
And, not every kind is ready to do that.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.230
Some clients hope the therapist will give them a magical quick fix solution to a deeply entangled crisis,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.689
a solution that requires no thinking on their part: no grappling with difficult choices,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.230
no unfavourable outcomes, no loss.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.070
In the obstacle course analogy, they want the therapist to lift them up and carry them to the finishing line.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.209
Even if that was possible, having avoided the personal development that comes with working through a crisis,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.140
the client would be left just as unprepared for the next crisis and just as dependent on others to solve it.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.218
Some clients want the therapist to help them fix someone else in their life: if only that person was different, everything would be okay.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.660
For these clients, there's no obstacle course of personal development to work through.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.080
The problem isn't with them, but the other person.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.860
And yet, they're the ones coming to therapy.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.590
Sometimes abusive individuals, including malignant narcissists, do come to therapy -- not necessarily to fix themselves.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.549
Years ago when I was working in a charity who offered clients blocks of six free therapy sessions,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.950
one client came because she thought it would make her appear more sympathetic in a child custody hearing.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.580
After attending the first of her six sessions with me, in which she exhibited a range of narcissistic traits,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.600
she then failed to attend the next four sessions.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.160
It later emerged that she had decided, on a whim, to go off on holiday,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.060
obliging me to preserve an empty room for four weeks,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.140
and delaying other clients on the waiting list who could have been seen.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.230
When she turned up for the final session,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.980
she was outraged that I refused to extend her sessions to make up for her absence

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.180
and that she wouldn't be getting a written declaration from me that she'd attended therapy.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.620
Clients like these try to construct their own brand of obstacle course for their therapists -- and it has nothing to do with personal growth.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.010
Being in a therapy room doesn't mean therapy will take place.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.209
For that to happen, the client has to be open to change.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.570
Trying to force change on resistant clients can make matters worse,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.800
activating all kinds of psychological defences that can further entrench them in their situations.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.700
In their 2002 paper "Resistance in Psychotherapy",

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:54.220
Beutler and colleagues found the low directive and self directive therapeutic approaches could work for some highly resistant clients,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.900
letting them take full control in leading the sessions.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.140
But even the most hands-off therapeutic style won't work in cases of extreme intransigence,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:13.500
and unfortunately, some of the most intransigent individuals happened to be narcissists -- and their targets.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.520
When neither party in a conflict is ready to change, the result is psychological gridlock.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.839
It's a mistake to view the extreme intransigence of either of these two populations as conscious pigheadedness.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.489
What we're looking at isn't willful perversity, but deeply rooted aspects of their respective psychologies.

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.829
When looking at human traits, things are rarely black-and-white.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:48.439
It's more useful to think of spectrums, spanning between absent and abundant.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:56.060
When it comes to narcissism, there's huge variation in the range and intensity exhibited by different individuals.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.960
Within the milder end there might only be one or two narcissistic attributes

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.200
If they're having a significant impact on relationships,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.020
and the individual possesses enough self-awareness, emotional resilience and openness to change,

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.100
there's every hope they can be effectively addressed in therapy.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.560
In many cases, these attributes might be better conceptualized as bad habits.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.750
what are called narcissistic fleas picked out by exposure to narcissistic behavior.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.840
As attributes increase in number and expressional intensity, hope of change begins to decrease.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:41.469
It might be some awareness of the problem. There might even be some attempt to engage in therapy.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.260
But, results can be volatile.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.040
Among my close and wider relatives, a number of individuals exhibited pronounced narcissistic traits.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.419
One of them would express her narcissism with brazen openness,

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.250
declaring that people were there to be used, and that they were like pieces on a chess board.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.660
You had to move them into the positions you wanted.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:12.120
She'd self-congratulatory stories about how she'd manipulated individuals in various underhand ways,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.800
including romantic partners.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.160
When her life began to derail after the end of a romantic relationship, she engaged a therapist.

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:29.529
She was disconcerted when he started challenging her on her manipulative behavior and her lack of interest in the feelings of others.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.559
Wasn't what she'd bargained for. But in the following months there were some changes in her behavior.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:43.230
Instead of endlessly talking about herself,  she began for the first time to ask other people about themselves.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:51.179
Although it was plain to hear her therapist's coaching in her mechanical delivery, it seemed like a step in a positive direction,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.160
but the effort of showing a basic interest seemed to exhaust her,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.920
and within a few weeks her behavior swung sharply back into even more negative territory than before.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:13.200
as she began to use her therapists social training tips not to improve relationships, but to become a more slippery manipulator.

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:20.609
As we tip over into the more extreme side of the narcissism spectrum, hope tails off exponentially.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.760
We start seeing a very bleak clinical picture.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:34.460
With full blown narcissists we're no longer even looking at a human personality as we recognize it -- we're looking at a suit of armour.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.240
All of us have to carry around some armor to protect ourselves.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:47.580
In healthy scenarios, that armour is flexible and economical, and adapts according to the specific social situation.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.440
In contrast, narcissists maintain full armor in the shape of a human suit.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.340
A fictional self, a phantom which they use to navigate the social world

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.380
This avatar is no casual deception.

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:11.739
It guards the narcissist against immobilizing fear: fear of rejection from others,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.690
and fear of facing the desolate void of their own inner landscape.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.480
It's a tool of survival.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.720
Tampering with that survival tool can arouse a sense of extreme existential threat.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.660
Change is unthinkable.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.689
The same absolute refusal to change can be seen in

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.780
narcissistic collectives who armour themselves with a false image of ideological perfection.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.720
Again, this false image is a tool of survival.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:54.960
To accept external criticism and admit to flaws and transgressions undermines the infallibility and superior moral virtue

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.680
that's come to define their very existence.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.529
As in therapy,

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:07.268
we can confidently predict that attempts to force change on highly resistant groups will intensify their defenses.

00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:15.159
There'll be more hardline policies, more control over image management, more secrecy, more paranoia.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.320
Individuals who succumbed to narcissistic abuse have often incurred a similar loss of self,

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.300
through damaging exposure to dysfunctional people in their formative years.

00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:33.418
But while narcissists respond by elevating themselves above other people in the form of a fantasy self,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.100
these individuals respond by elevating other people above themselves.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.860
They become pleasers, fixers, codependents,

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.380
turning themselves into whatever other people want them to be.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.229
In Ray Bradbury's "The Martian Chronicles",

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:56.169
the Martians show a similar trait: they're empathic shapeshifters.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.180
When Mars is colonized by earth visitors,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.240
the Martians try to avoid annihilation by transforming themselves

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.080
into the people the colonists want them to be.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.480
One of them becomes the long-lost son of an elderly couple who take him in as their own.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:22.840
But when the couple takes him into town the Martian is unable to resist the dreams and fantasies of the other colonists in the crowded streets,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.820
He is forced into a succession of identities:

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:33.180
a wanted murderer, a lost husband, the town mayor, a young girl.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.820
He is melting wax, shaping to their minds.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.510
Eventually overwhelmed by trying to be all things to all people, the Martian dies.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:52.570
Like the Martian, codependents can feel an irresistible compulsion to be what people want,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.210
and can end up feeling pulled apart when the assembled company wants conflicting things.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:05.109
They've been groomed to serve others and to feel responsible for other people's feelings and needs,

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.200
to the detriment or exclusion of their own.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.020
They've been trained to feel responsible for other people's problems and for fixing them.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.689
In polar contrast to the narcissist who wears excessive protective armor,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.940
codependents suffer from a lack of armor and a magnified vulnerability.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.840
This vulnerability is double-edged:

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.560
In the right circumstances, their over-receptivity to other people's ideas can be the path to restoration.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.080
If codependent types are fortunate enough to meet healthy partners or fall in with a decent supportive crowd,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.609
there's every hope that they can construct a sense of self,

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:54.440
and over time learn to internalize their sense of worth so they no longer have to rely on others to provide it.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:01.430
But the outlook can be very different if they're unlucky enough to become involved with a narcissist,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:08.660
and unfortunately their vulnerability acts like a shining beacon to emotional predators.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:17.300
In fact the pairing of an empathic codependent and a self-absorbed narcissist works like a star and a black hole:

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.120
The strong empath is like a bright star offering endless light to others,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.480
understanding them, seeing things from their point of view, affirming their feelings.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.420
While the narcissist dehumanizes, the empath humanizes.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.500
The narcissist is like a black hole.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.800
Once a star itself, the black hole collapsed under its own gravity.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:50.980
Now instead of emitting light it absorbs light from the stars that fall into its pull.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.460
In a similar way, narcissists have collapsed under their own grandiosity,

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.180
which now feeds voraciously on the affirmation of others.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:09.199
Some codependence idealize the narcissist unreservedly and try to be whatever the narcissist wants.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.129
Other codependents realized the narcissist is damaged,

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.660
but instead of taking a step back they rush forward,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.680
offering boundless empathy in the hope of eventually filling the hole.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:29.140
They have no idea of the depth of that hole, which has room for them and hundreds more like them.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.020
When they've been drained to a husk, having given everything,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.440
they'll be abruptly discarded and replaced with the next supply

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.160
They didn't realize they were empathizing with a hoax.

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:55.019
To understand other people's responses, we generally use our own minds as a road map.

00:14:56.139 --> 00:15:02.039
We assume a similar landscape: similar values, feelings and basic motivations.

00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:04.949
As we get more detailed information,

00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:10.558
we update the landscape, erasing erroneous assumptions, adding new features.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.700
We're emotional cartographers, creating mind maps of the people we encounter.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.020
To create accurate, high-resolution mind maps takes a lot of focused listening and observing.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:33.760
Failing to listen and observe can lead to huge errors: we might ignore important differences or overemphasize trivial ones.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:42.520
If we're in the grip of a powerfully tribalistic outlook, when we look at non-members we might overlay alien landscapes

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.940
on what in reality are very similar terrains.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.719
Imperfect codependents often do the reverse,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.909
misguidedly overlaying similar terrain on very alien landscapes.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:02.749
It seems contradictory to suggest that strong empaths could be so out of touch with the feelings of a person in their midst,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.429
but empaths are just as reliant as everyone else on the map they're using.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:15.409
Given the correct map, the strong empath will feel the other person's feelings while a weak empath might merely imagine them.

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:23.669
Given the wrong map, the strong empath will still feel the emotions indicated on that map, they'll just be the wrong emotions

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.729
Unfortunately strong empathic codependents can have special problems with maps.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.839
One of those problems is over-identification.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:40.169
Empathising involves stepping into the world of another person to see things from their perspective.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.669
In effect, we have one foot in our world and the other in theirs.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.320
Keeping both feet in our own world could be described as sympathy.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:56.800
Here, we see things from our own point of view and our assessments can seem a little remote and disconnected.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.920
On the flipside, if we put both feet in the other person's world, we can fall into overidentification.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.200
Lines get blurred in both directions.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:13.080
We begin to mistake the other person's stuff for our own, and our own stuff for theirs.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.910
We become emotionally enmeshed.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:24.520
With their loose emotional boundaries, strong empathic codependents can easily slide into overidentification.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.000
They might see themselves in their abuser:

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.680
a damaged individual who needed saving, but who no one came to save,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:40.920
and they can become stuck in a vicarious rescue mission, determined to be the one who saves their abuser.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.340
It seems a win-win: by saving their abuser, hey save themselves.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.510
But it's a lose-lose.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.540
Their abuser is not like them, and their abuser will just hold them down in perpetual misery.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.960
If empaths redirected their immense compassion towards themselves,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.180
they could salvage at least one win, the only possible one.

00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:08.500
Their own.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.779
But for the codependent empath, self compassion can feel like blasphemy.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.160
Maintaining some firm grounding in our own world gives us a degree of objectivity.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.380
We listen to people's words, but we also observe their actions.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.360
And when the two don't match, we know it's the actions that need our focus.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:35.699
Without that objectivity, strong empaths can end up being overly impressed by emotional displays,

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:43.529
when their abusers promise for the umpteenth time that they'll never abuse again and swear that they'll change.

00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:51.689
Empaths feel that desperate emotion exuded in those words, so much so that they can even end up comforting their abuser.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.350
Overwhelmed with empathy, the codependent loses sight of what they know from bitter experience.

00:18:59.379 --> 00:19:05.009
The abuser's promises are just worthless words, never honoured with action.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:14.420
Aside from maladaptive empathy, codependent individuals can exhibit a sweep of other mutually reinforcing maladaptive habits,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:20.680
including maladaptive hope, maladaptive problem solving, and maladaptive curiosity.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:28.460
Codependents learn to feel maladaptive false hope in the fleeting moments of their abusers' magnanimity.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:34.559
A small act of apparent kindness gets interpreted that as a shaft of sunlight,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.770
an expression of personal value from the abuser.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.920
They hope that behind the broody gray clouds, there really is a bright sun,

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.680
and that one day the clouds will part permanently, but there is no sun.

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:55.139
Codependents have just grown so accustomed to the dark that any dim light can seem dazzling.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.110
Codependents pick up maladaptive problem-solving strategies,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.980
Being trained to feel responsible for all problems, problem solving is a nonstop occupation.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.500
In the brief moments when there's no current crisis to deal with,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.700
codependents will often be either dwelling on past problems or anticipating future ones.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.860
Sadly, all their efforts are pointless.

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:24.648
Problem solving for codependents works like superstition.

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:28.609
Superstition is about an illusion of influence.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:34.309
By performing superstitious rituals or avoiding superstitious objects,

00:20:34.309 --> 00:20:40.099
we give ourselves the false comfort that we've brought ourselves good luck or escaped bad luck.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.939
The roots of superstitious thinking are plain enough.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.680
Humans are pattern-seeking.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.869
We look for connections between events, between actions and consequences.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.069
Where our pattern-seeking is disciplined with critical thought, we gain new insights about our universe.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:05.180
Where our pattern-seeking is undisciplined we fall into prejudice, dogma and superstition.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:12.360
Targets of abuse often believe that by staying on that hamster wheel, endlessly working to solve problems,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.040
they're having some positive effect on the situation

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.299
Targets who step off the wheel often find that the situation stays much the same.

00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:26.819
Part of effective problem solving is identifying superstitious components,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.210
extraneous procedures that have no effect.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.599
That means testing our underlying assumptions.

00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:40.299
Endlessly explaining to abusers how their behavior makes you feel has no positive effect.

00:21:40.729 --> 00:21:47.859
This superstitious ritual falsely assumes abusers don't know what they're doing, and that they care about your feelings.

00:21:48.739 --> 00:21:51.549
Correct those assumptions, and you'll stop explaining.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.440
Offering endless forgiveness and love in the face of abuse has no positive effect.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:05.940
These superstitious rituals assume abusers will appreciate the chances they're given and value targets more.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:12.279
Instead what abusers learn is that targets will take anything, and they value them less.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:19.849
Holding on to their false assumptions about their abusers, targets become their own impossible problem

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:27.670
Maladaptive empathy, hope, and problem-solving can keep targets effectively chained to their abusers.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:35.880
Even those who managed to escape the situation can fall prey to another trap: maladaptive curiosity.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:43.000
Many escapees from abuse feel a temptation to check up on past abusers to see if they've changed.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.490
Maybe their departure had a transformative effect.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:56.200
If they find their abusers on their best behaviour, it can re-energize all the old illusions they had that there really is hope.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:04.160
Within days of giving things another go, the false smile twists and the abuse recommences.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.760
Curiosity is a healthy instinct, the desire to know and learn.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:17.720
The curiosity that fails to absorb information starts looking like something else, namely, denial.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:25.240
When we're in denial, we have all the information we need, but we decline to know it or learn from it.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:32.870
When we look at codependents from the outside with detached sympathy, we might ask ourselves, why don't they just leave?

00:23:33.899 --> 00:23:38.629
But when we see some of their inner world, it's amazing that they make it out at all.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:45.629
One target of abuse said his inner landscape felt like being on a tiny raft on a stormy ocean,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.189
constantly getting knocked overboard with no land in sight,

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.479
and using the brief moments when the sea was calm just to get his breath back before the next wave hit.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.649
Some targets have described their inner landscapes as a rollercoaster you can't get off.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:11.539
Amusement park themes are common; one of the images I use to describe my old inner landscape was a Hall of Mirrors,

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.029
with no exit, where bizarre distortions are constantly thrust on you.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:26.660
Mazes, kaleidoscopes, whitewater rapids. The metaphors for perpetual disorientation are endless.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.369
Each of us has to want to look for a way out of these landscapes,

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.429
to find land, to get off the ride, to discover an exit.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.760
No one else can force us to want that. No one can fix us.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:50.200
But, as outsiders we can be ready to help when the desire to change exists.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:02.680
Surviving abusive environments often comes with a mix of joy and pain:

00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:09.409
the joy of reclaiming acres of headspace previously colonized by our abusers,

00:25:09.989 --> 00:25:12.709
but also the pain of leaving others behind.

00:25:13.889 --> 00:25:17.238
Giving up trying to fix people doesn't mean giving up on people.

00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:22.728
It just means acknowledging we can only be of help to people who are ready to change.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.860
There is no magic bullet.

00:25:26.419 --> 00:25:32.379
There's no single thing we can say or do that's guaranteed to shake someone into recovery.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:40.780
When we hear the stories of people who've escaped abusive individuals or groups, there's a huge variety of individual turning points.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.960
For some it happens when their abuser pushes them too far

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.740
Inconceivable as it seems after all the mistreatment they've endured,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.540
they discover they do have a threshold of tolerance, a line that won't be crossed.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.909
That discovery can shift the whole dynamic.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:06.200
For some targets it's the chilling experience of peering into that suit of armous one day and seeing there's nothing inside.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.100
People refer to it as seeing the mask slip.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:15.980
It's a moment that can stay with you and swiftly ravage all your previous illusions.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.649
For some empathic targets, it's the experience of seeing other people abused.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.829
Even though their own pain is often invisible to them, they can feel the pain of others acutely.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.940
These moments of personal insight can't be orchestrated from the outside.

00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:36.729
People will see what they're ready to see.

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:43.059
The abusers mask might already have slipped many times before the target finally registers it.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:50.600
Trying to force change on people who aren't ready can end up doing more damage, arousing powerful resistances.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:56.100
And if, in their eyes, we just become another person telling them what to do,

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.260
we can end up further reinforcing their sense of being invisible

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.820
their lack of autonomy and independent thought, their lack of self.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.820
Recovery is about breaking dysfunctional patterns, counteracting dysfunctional messages.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.620
While we might not be able to wake targets up,

00:27:14.639 --> 00:27:18.409
we can at least work against those old patterns and messages.

00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:21.439
We can show targets they're visible to us.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.360
We can invite them to make their own choices, to encourage their autonomy

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:33.460
We can offer non-directive empathy; we can let them know we see the confusion and pain they feel.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:40.610
Sometimes just knowing they've been seen and heard is the most important experience targets can have

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:49.009
Constantly caught up in other people's thoughts, it reminds them they exist; that can be the start of a sense of self.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.000
Talking of breaking patterns, it's instructive to examine our own.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.860
What old patterns might lie behind our desire to fix people?

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.999
Are we taking responsibility for problems that are not of our making?

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.210
Where did we learn to do that?

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.819
Are we over identifying with other targets, unable to separate ourselves?

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.200
There might still be a lot of healing ahead for us.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:25.680
In fact, it could be said that one of the biggest signs of healing in ourselves is when we can start letting go of fixing people.
