00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.840
Recently, an individual I’ll call Troy sent
me a message saying he feels like

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.680
he’s stuck between atheism and theism.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.260
He identifies as an atheist
but continues to lapse back into theism.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.060
These lapses are prompted by accidents
like denting his car or twisting his ankle.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.360
He experiences a strong guilt response, believing he’s being punished by a supreme being

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.780
and finds himself reciting prayers.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.060
Lately, he’s started to feel like he’ll never shake the idea

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.580
that he’s being watched and judged
as defective by a supreme being.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.480
I relayed Troy’s story to my patrons

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.840
and asked if any of them experienced similar episodes.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.980
In a straw poll, 20 out of 70 individuals

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.380
registered that they did experience temporary lapses.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.920
Several folks registered that the concept
of lapses didn’t apply to them

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.140
because they’d always been atheists.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.760
Some folks said they used to have lapses,
but they didn’t last.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.300
Some described more fleeting experiences

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.340
of detached reflection that had no big emotional impact.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.880
Some said they had lapses,
but in response to other stimuli

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.780
like coincidences, choral music or when they find themselves in a group practicing communal prayer.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.260
But for others, their episodes — like Troy’s —
were about anticipating punishment and judgement.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.980
I want to drill down into this notion of an
all-knowing, all-powerful, omnipresent judge

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.460
and look at why, if it existed

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.460
this so-called ‘supreme being’ should
be apologising rather than judging.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.600
This is not going to be a list of divinely
perpetrated atrocities cited in religious scriptures

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.980
— tales of divinely sanctioned
subjugation, persecution, genocidal bloodbaths.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.520
That list is long and the atrocities are as
callous and sadistic as it gets.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.540
But you don’t have to subscribe to any specific
religion to find this hypothetical judge guilty.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.640
The charges go deeper than scripture, to the essential
nature of the judge

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.140
and the theological foundations of the concept of ‘evil’.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.380
But first, I want to say something about these
persistent anxieties some folks feel

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.400
about being punished and judged
by some all-seeing presence.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.920
In my psychological work, I’ve spoken with men
and women involved in abusive relationships

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.840
and it didn’t take long to spot theistic echoes.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.400
In a session with one of my very first clients

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.840
a man I’ll call Ben who presented with depression

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.860
I was struck by the sense that the partner
he’d been describing didn’t sound human.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.180
She sounded like some omnipresent entity,
seeping into every moment of his life

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:35.080
scrutinising his every move, anticipating every thought — and wielding the power of ultimate judgement over him.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.640
I shared this with Ben and commented that it was as if he was talking about a god rather than a human being.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.360
After a cavernous silence, gazing up at the ceiling

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200
he wryly remarked that
he’d swapped one tyrant for another.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.100
At first I wondered if he was referring to
a previous relationship.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.460
He explained he was talking about a god

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.920
and spoke about the struggle he’d had extracting himself from the religion he’d been indoctrinated into as a child.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.500
As we compared these divine and human dictators

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.020
and how both of them had taken a hold of him,
some parallels emerged.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.180
Both of these abusive regimes had substantially
diminished Ben’s capacity for independent thinking

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.520
by conditioning a range of reflex
responses into him.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.760
When Ben first encountered unreasonable ideas and behaviour — in both his religion and his relationship —

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.320
there was an explosion of thinking on his part.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.660
His brain went into problem-solving mode

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.360
as he tried to figure out what was going on
and how to respond.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:43.520
He tried various strategies — using logic and reason, appealing to fairness, offering compromises —

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.700
gradually giving away more ground. But
authoritarian regimes aren’t big on compromise

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.860
and, in both his religion
and his relationship

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.480
the conflict only ended when
Ben admitted he was wrong.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.540
The next time he encountered
unreasonable ideas and behaviour

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.900
he again tried to think through a considered response

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.660
but put up less of a defence
before admitting he was wrong.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.500
He said it was like a hole opening up behind him that became easier to fall into each time.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.320
Soon he’d learned to admit he was wrong immediately, with no intervening period of thought.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.120
This unthinking response to a stimulus
is known as a reflex.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.500
And abusers can build up a range
of these reflexes in their target,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.240
so eventually the target can be played like a puppet,
twitching mechanically to various cues.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.920
When targets begin to see these reflex responses

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.420
they can begin to reintroduce
the missing element of conscious thought.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.340
For instance, targets who realise
they always robotically obey certain orders

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.360
like getting their partner a beer

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.020
can begin to think about this reflex response and
to consider and implement different outcomes.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.820
In many cases, the ultimate outcome
will be a parting of the ways.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.540
When targets of abuse start thinking for themselves
and rebuilding their eroded sense of worth

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.940
impossible ideas can become possible,
including the idea of leaving.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.680
People recovering from abusive religious,
pseudoscientific and socio-political ideologies

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.480
that’ve instilled a range of reflex responses in them
— reflex compliance, reflex guilt, reflex fear —

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.480
sometimes have to do similar work

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.080
to reintroduce the conscious thought
that’s been conditioned out of them.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.960
Something else that can aid recovery is taking
a good long critical look at the abuser.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.120
Ben noted that, in relation
to both his partner and his religion

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.020
he became so consumingly preoccupied trying to meet the superhuman standards they set for him

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.640
and feeling anxious and fearful when he failed to do so

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.720
that he didn’t stop to consider how well
they matched up to those standards themselves.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.320
When we turn the spotlight on abusers

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.440
we repeatedly find not only that they come
nowhere near the standards they set for others

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.160
but that they operate on
a completely different set of rules

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.700
one that shields them from all the hardships
their targets were expected to endure.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.680
We have no control over the circumstances of our birth.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.300
Throughout history, we humans’ve found ourselves

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.080
randomly born on parts of the Earth’s land mass

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.460
where a substantial percentage of the population
has happened to follow a particular religion.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.700
Many of us will’ve found ourselves being
labelled members of that religion from birth

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.540
and taught to accept its mythology uncritically as truth.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.320
We’ll often be taught that the purpose of
our life is to serve one or more

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.040
of thousands of mythical beings
proposed by humans over the centuries

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.780
and made to attend regular worship services
in religious temples dedicated to these entities.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.180
In some cases, the entity concerned
will be conceptualised

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.280
as a single all-knowing, all-powerful,
omnipresent creator.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.280
But this nebulous concept
is difficult for little minds to grasp.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.300
To make it seem more personal and relatable

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.900
some religions humanise it
by claiming that we were created in its image

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.400
implying that we share significant characteristics with it.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.060
This personification might be underscored
with anthropomorphic language.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:37.120
The creator might be pictured walking around a garden or enjoying the aroma of animal sacrifices

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.340
which would seem to require legs
and a nose of some description.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.760
There might be references
to friendly face-to-face conversations.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.520
Other more obscure parts of its anatomy might
be mentioned, like its back side.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.980
Well, thrones are built for arses,&nbsp;and various
religions —&nbsp;including all the Abrahamic ones —

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.720
speak of a divine ceremonial chair.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.940
Polytheistic deities can be humanised
by adding family members.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.580
Ancient Greek religion was
overrun with divine siblings and offspring,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:13.400
including a slew of demigods — products of numerous dalliances between the gods and the mortals.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.620
The concept of family might seem
off-limits to monotheistic religions.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.280
But Christianity famously manages to have it both ways.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.340
Or more accurately, three ways.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:30.840
In Christian mythology, the creator Yahweh had a son
— the Christian messiah Jesus —

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.900
who, according to a Christian prayer called the Gloria, sits at his father’s right hand.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.960
Presumably, space is reserved
at Yahweh’s left hand for the holy spirit

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.100
which, after Yahweh and Jesus, forms the third prong
of what Christians call ‘the Holy Trinity’

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:53.520
a mathematics-defying celestial equation in which
one plus one plus one equals one.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.920
All this humanising language and
physical imagery can go a long way

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.100
towards making the cloudy concept of an all-knowing,
all-powerful, omnipresent creator

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.260
feel concrete, relatable, accessible, personal.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:15.320
In particular, using intimate forms of address like ‘Father’
can make it so easy for children and adults

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.280
to project onto that cloudy concept all their
fantasies of a supreme parent

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.280
arousing all the infantilising feelings
associated with those fantasies.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.300
Feelings of implicit trust, loyalty, deference and respect.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.380
But none of this humanising language
and imagery holds up.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.820
And when we begin to get to grips
with just how utterly inhuman this god concept is

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.740
it becomes clear that if this alien
character had created us

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.520
it would have more to answer for than any human.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.800
The phrase ‘created in its image’
has various interpretations.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:56.420
It’s been said to refer to ‘physical image’, 
‘emotional image’, ’moral image’, ‘intellectual image’

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.420
and, maybe most obscure of all, ‘relational image’.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.040
Even allowing the progressively
swollen poetic licence behind these interpretations

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.100
all of them fail.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:13.640
But they do provide a handy framework tor presenting the charges against this divine judge.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.940
The idea that our bodies bear any physical resemblance to an all-knowing, all-powerful,omnipresent creator

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.680
is one relatively few folks seem
keen to defend these days.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.820
As our knowledge of biology and physics has increased

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.880
we’ve come to appreciate that
the physical form of a being

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.800
is intimately connected to the specific
environmental conditions it inhabits.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.200
Wings come in many shapes and sizes.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:44.960
But we’ve learned those shapes and sizes are constrained by factors like drag, thrust, lift and weight.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.480
And we’ve realised that
some of the mythical winged characters

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480
humans’ve dreamed up over the centuries

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.800
from Icarus with his wings of feathers and wax
to the Biblical six-winged seraphim

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.870
would simply never get off the ground.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:05.220
Likewise, we now appreciate the absurdity
of a vast naturally humanoid god

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.860
possessing depth-perceiving forward-facing eyes
with nothing external to see

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.080
stereo-perceiving ears with nothing external to hear

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:20.740
agile limbs with no external space
through which to move —&nbsp;and so on.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.380
The most common view I’ve encountered
from folks proposing a mythical creator

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.800
is that it has no physical form at all.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.660
So why do we?

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.800
Expanding on those four words

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.940
why do we have a physical form
that can be damaged or destroyed

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:43.880
by other humans, predators, microbes, poisonous materials and natural disasters

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.020
that frequently attacks itself
with debilitating and deadly cancers

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:54.160
and that quickly perishes without
adequate food, water or oxygen

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.460
or if its core temperature falls or rises
by just a few degrees Fahrenheit.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.240
A form that — if it survives these hazards —

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.500
can look forward to incapacitation
and decay before its inevitable death.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:15.740
Why are we subjected to these sufferings
by a creator that’s immune to them?

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.340
When I was a Christian

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:23.040
I was told human suffering was a result of being endowed with the most precious gift from Yahweh.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.780
The gift of free choice.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.980
The reasoning went like this:

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.000
Yahweh created us with free choice to do bad or good.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.260
That meant people had to be allowed to do bad things

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.520
even if they ended up hurting
— or even killing — countless others.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.800
Preventing them from doing bad things
would take away their free choice.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.080
In effect, they would be forced
to be good against their will.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:56.860
So Yahweh couldn't interfere either by restraining an abuser or protecting the abuser’s target.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:03.040
The meagre consolation offered to us
was that all abuse would eventually be punished.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.100
In regard to the other hardships we endured
—&nbsp;diseases, predators, natural disasters —

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.880
these were all presented as extensions
of the same principle.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.340
The first humans had been given a paradise to live in.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.620
But because they disobeyed their creator

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.360
they were expelled to the world we now live in,
with all of its dangers.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.960
So even these forms of suffering were
ultimately down to human free choice.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.220
When I was a Christian, I found this
reasoning persuasive for a time.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.120
It didn’t stop me resenting the suffering
we had to endure

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:43.700
but I could appreciate that the alternative of forcing everyone to be good was also extremely undesirable.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:51.980
In fact, the lack of freedom entailed by forcing people
to be good could itself be seen as a form of suffering.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.840
Given the option of free choice plus suffering

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.500
or no free choice plus no suffering

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.000
I could see the appeal of option one.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.600
I later realised I’d fallen for a false
dichotomy

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:10.100
the presentation of two alternatives as the only alternatives, when in fact others exist.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:16.980
The clue that this was a false dichotomy was
staring me in the face —&nbsp;albeit, in a non-physical way.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.500
It was Yahweh.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.680
And this demonstrates another parallel
with human abusive relationships

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.160
in that we spend so much time
absolutely focussed on these dictators

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.680
and yet not seeing them at all.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:36.780
Here, supposedly, was a being that enjoyed total free choice with full knowledge of good and evil

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.140
but experienced no suffering.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.900
It was impossible to harm this being.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:48.020
To do so would be to diminish its greatness
in some way, violating its divine incorruptibility.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.120
So free choice and suffering weren’t inevitably paired.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:57.300
You didn’t have to either accept both
or reject both —&nbsp;not if you were incorruptible.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.820
So why weren’t we created in this incorruptible image?

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.540
Why are we down here in these bizarre, fragile bodies

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.720
being infected, beaten, starved,
raped, tortured and murdered

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.560
while this supposed creator enjoys
an existence devoid of suffering?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.560
It’s been put to me that the creator
couldn’t create beings like itself.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.900
One reason offered is that its creation
might then overpower it.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.580
First, how could it overpower its creator?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.940
They would be like two perfect chess players

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.580
able to anticipate every one of their opponent’s moves.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.940
The only possible outcome is stalemate.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:41.760
Second, wouldn’t a desire to overpower its
creator indicate some deficiency?

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:47.760
If the creation was a copy of the creator, this deficiency would have to exist in the original.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.163
If you’re arguing that a copy
of the creator could go rogue

00:16:51.163 --> 00:16:54.520
you’re arguing that the original could go rogue.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.986
A Christian undergrad student I once knew

00:16:56.986 --> 00:17:00.880
suggested that a god-like creation
might abuse its power in other ways

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.260
for example by creating less powerful beings
and subjecting them to torture.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.660
She didn’t realise she was describing her own god.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.860
We have to look at things from the perspective
of an all-knowing, all-powerful creator.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:23.940
Vulnerability, hardship, abuse, pain, distress, fear
— it has no experience of these things.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.120
It would have to design beings utterly unlike itself

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.760
in order for them to be capable of experiencing suffering.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:37.760
In designing those beings, it would bring these previously non-existent phenomena into existence.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.740
The theological implications are clear.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.680
It created suffering.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.920
It created torment.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.540
It created sickness.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.400
Some claim we were made
in the ‘emotional image’ of a creator.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:56.220
It can have a profoundly humanising effect when
we imagine we were created by a being

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.780
that experiences all the feelings we do.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.580
But the emotional landscape
we experience becomes incoherent

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.260
when applied to an all-knowing, all-powerful creator.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.980
Just like wings, emotions only make 
sense under certain conditions.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:16.620
We use emotions in dealing with our lack
of control and our lack of foreknowledge.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:23.880
To a creator that has total control and total knowledge, the human emotional landscape is meaningless.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.139
This creator can’t feel fear.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:32.960
Fear is a response to real or perceived threat.
An all-powerful being experiences neither of these.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.000
It can’t feel disappointment.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.620
Disappointment is a response to
the non-fulfilment of hopes and expectations.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:46.360
An all-knowing being doesn’t hope — it knows —
and its expectations are never wrong.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.760
Does it feel anger? Religious scriptures
are full of scenes of divine rage.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.700
But the characters they describe have the same stagy feel as the Great Oz

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.300
from Lyman Frank Baum’s Wizard of Oz

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.920
whose overblown theatrics are
designed to impress and intimidate.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.260
In fact, these scriptural tantrums
make no sense whatsoever.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.080
Anger is a response to provocation.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.920
While human dictators are often easily provoked because of their flaccid egos

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.960
a truly all-powerful being would have no such weakness.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.260
Anger’s also a response to things not going our way.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:29.100
An all-knowing, all-powerful being knows
every outcome before it sets any plan in motion.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.780
Everything goes its way.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.980
Does it feel sorrow? Sorrow is a response
to regret and misfortune.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.120
Both of these indicate a desire that things had happened differently.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.640
Such notions are incompatible
with an all-knowing, all-powerful being

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.760
whose plans could not be improved on.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:55.060
Which brings us to an emotion that this creator
should feel — in abundance. Guilt.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:00.377
A response to the sense we’ve done wrong,
specifically that we’ve caused harm.

00:20:00.377 --> 00:20:05.340
An all-knowing being would be aware of all the unnecessary harm it’s brought into existence

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.640
by creating us with such excessive
capacity for suffering.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.660
But guilt is the one divine emotion we never hear about.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:21.880
Some claim we were created in the ‘moral image’
of an all-knowing, all-powerful, omnipresent creator.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.780
Again, this only draws attention to our polar differences.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.039
Morality is intrinsically grounded in knowledge.

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:34.760
It’s only through a comprehensive knowledge of relevant factors that sound moral decisions  can be made.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.700
An all-knowing creator would have that knowledge.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.380
We don’t.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.440
And that puts our moral images worlds apart.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.700
Aside from making us instantly vulnerable to deception

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.960
— something to which an all-knowing
creator is impervious —

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.880
our lack of knowledge makes us
vulnerable to all kinds of errors.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:59.040
We still misinterpret harmless
human variation as sick and sinful

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.940
leading us to pathologise and punish
countless healthy, innocent people.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.480
We misinterpret sickness as divine curses,
leading us to abuse the ill.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.720
We misinterpret sickness as divine blessing.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.660
In Jeanette Winterson’s brilliant autobiographical novel ‘Oranges are not the only fruit’

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.300
she describes a period
in her childhood when she became deaf

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.960
and her Pentecostal evangelist mother

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.960
— who yearned for the apocalypse and whose favourite song was ‘God has blotted them out’ —

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.880
declared her daughter to be in a state of rapture.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:39.460
Thanks to external intervention, Jeanette was taken
to hospital for a vital operation.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.560
Because of our lack of knowledge,
we twist the very concept of harm.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:50.800
Some of us cry harm when others point out the flaws
in our ideas,  or merely express disagreement.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:57.060
Valid criticism is twisted into an immoral,
harmful act on a par with physical harm

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.440
merely because we don’t like
having our fallacious ideas challenged.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.980
On the flipside, actual physically harm
gets twisted into therapy.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:12.680
Savage, gratuitous beatings are reframed
as ‘tough love’ and ‘moral guidance’

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.360
—&nbsp;a sadism justified with
the false analogy of unpleasant medicine

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.380
that’s horrible to take but makes us better.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.180
Without the essential ingredient of knowledge

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.860
we label all kinds of bad ‘good’,
and all kinds of good ‘bad’.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.560
Maybe most ironic of all, because of our lack of knowledge

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.800
there are times when we want to help
but simply don’t know how.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.400
It could be anything from wanting to cure a disease

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.380
to wanting to rescue someone who’s been
recruited by a harmful group.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.350
Here, the urge to help is palpably there

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.180
but our lack of knowledge holds us back.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.460
Here, we are the reverse image of a creator

00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:02.040
that knows the cure to every sickness and the solution
to every problem — but declines to help.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:08.900
Some folks claim that, as reasoning, logical beings,
we reflect the ‘intellectual image’ of a creator.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.320
But this creator has no use for reason or logic.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:20.260
We use reason and logic to lever our way out
of ignorance and uncertainty into knowledge.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:26.299
We use logical syllogisms to work out that
if idea one is true and idea two is true

00:23:26.299 --> 00:23:29.800
then logically idea three must be true.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.720
An all-knowing creator already knows
if idea three is true

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.940
without having to work through any logical process.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.680
It also knows when either of the first two
ideas are false

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.920
— something we often fail to recognise,
leading to unsound conclusions.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:52.180
An all-knowing creator is immune to the scores
of logical fallacies to which we’re vulnerable.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.360
There’s an appealing irony in the fact that,
if this creator existed

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:01.720
it would be listening in on all the fallacious arguments some people make for its existence

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.789
like appeals to ignorance,
where a god is presented as true

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:09.420
just because the individual
can’t imagine any alternative.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.360
An all-knowing creator never has to learn.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:18.840
Learning and reliance on an imperfect memory
are burdens exclusive to its creation.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.800
And let’s not forget the burden of faith,&nbsp;
which requires the suspension of our critical faculties

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:32.180
further diminishing our already severely diminished intellectual capacity in the service of religious beliefs.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.520
An all-knowing being is incapable of faith.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.440
It will never have to believe something
for which it has no evidence.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:46.700
And it will never experience the dissonance that results
from finding out its faith was misplaced.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:50.940
In Josh and Sean McDowell’s
‘Bible Handbook of Difficult Verses’

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:56.940
when addressing the difficult verse in Genesis that speaks of  the Christian creator making us in its image

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:03.180
the authors skip every other kind of image so far mentioned and go straight for ‘relational image’.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.620
They claim we inherited from their god

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.820
‘the ability to communicate our thoughts,
intents and feelings to others’

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.560
and cite the repeated scriptural phrase ‘God said’

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.160
as evidence that relationships mean
communication to others.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.680
But what kind of communication?

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.780
One of my first teachers was always complaining:
‘You can’t talk to a book!’

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.820
She was expressing her frustration as a reader

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.040
at being unable to ask authors about their intended meaning.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:39.460
Change one word and we have the problem with
divine communication: ‘You can’t talk to a god’.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.760
The being claimed by some
to be the most important in the universe

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.500
with the most important message for humanity

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.700
doesn’t take questions.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:55.040
Instead, it’s claimed to use two of the most
error-prone kinds of communication possible.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.180
The first is scripture, open to multiple
conflicting interpretations

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.560
with no way of verifying which ones are valid.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.720
The second consists of signs
in the form of arbitrary life events

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.600
including coincidences and odd physical sensations.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:20.940
Here, the recipient first has to somehow determine
that the sign is a sign rather than just a random event.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:26.560
The recipient then has to determine
its meaning,&nbsp;again with no divine verification.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.040
It’s a recipe for chaos.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.760
And chaos is exactly what we see

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:37.580
with religious groups clashing,&nbsp;often violently,
over competing interpretations.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:44.000
Thankfully, human communication doesn’t follow
this inferior one-way relational image.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.370
Our relational image goes both ways

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.980
employing the revolutionary concept of dialogue.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.160
This allows us to check with each other
for errors in our understanding.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.980
It also allows cooperation and negotiation

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.780
— two more concepts conspicuously
lacking in the creator’s image.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:07.320
The McDowells also claim that taking care
of the poor and defending human rights

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.300
find their basis in each of us because we were
purposely created in their god’s relational image

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.480
— with value, dignity, and worth.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.040
But if we had been made in the relational
image of this supposed god

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.680
we’d show no compassion and offer no help.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.740
We’d stand by, watching
and doing nothing, just as it does

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.080
passively permitting every kind of suffering.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.600
We might try to shield ourselves
from harm in an ultimately vain attempt

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.580
to emulate a creator that’s
conveniently shielded from all harm.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:47.740
But there’d be no taking care of the poor,
and no defending of human rights.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:55.240
The reason we support and fight for others is because we’re not made in this creator’s relational image.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:02.180
The concepts of competition and worship are also absent from the creator’s relational image.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:07.380
Meanwhile we’re forced to compete
for limited resources just to survive

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:12.880
and we’re threatened and deceived
into worshipping false icons.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.160
The more we try to pin down what it might mean

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.920
to be created in the image
of an all-knowing, all-powerful being

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.260
the more fundamental differences
we expose on every level

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:29.520
— physical, emotional, moral, intellectual and relational.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.760
All of these fundamental differences reflect burdens
we endure that this mythical creator does not

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.720
— even the positive ones.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.360
If we were all-knowing, we’d have no need for dialogue.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.920
If we didn’t suffer, compassion would be redundant.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.020
As creators ourselves, we constantly model
our creations on our own image

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.600
from service robots to video game characters
to remotely operated avatar androids

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:04.160
like the Telenoid, created by Japanese roboticist
Hiroshi Ishiguro, endowed with arms for giving hugs.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.480
We’re drawn to interact with human-like creations
— it’s what we understand.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:15.280
But, as we begin to explore the possibilities
of creating actual artificial life

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.420
artificial consciousness, artificial intelligence

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.000
should we instead follow the example
of our mythical creator

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.820
and make our creations completely unlike us?

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.460
Should we impose new forms of suffering on them?

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.300
Dream up new kinds of vulnerability?

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.700
Should we introduce them to a range
of environmental hazards unknown to us?

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:43.360
Should we invent a collection of distressing emotions for them that we were incapable of experiencing?

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:52.480
And should we threaten terrible punishments if, 
after all this, they declined to worship us?

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.860
If you’re feeling squeamish
about any of these suggestions

00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:01.340
you’re showing how different you are
from a hypothetical all-knowing, all-powerful creator

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.100
who’s willing to do all of the above.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:10.180
Wanting worse for others than for yourself
is no indication of greatness.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.540
On the subject of artificial life ....

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.160
In Isaac Asimov’s short story ‘Runaround’

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.900
engineers Mike Donovan and Gregory Powell
travel to Mercury with a robot called Speedy

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.240
to restart a mining station.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.080
Finding that the life-support system is running low on
selenium

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.620
Powell and Donovan send Speedy out
to a selenium pool a few miles away to obtain some.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:50.000
Hours later Speedy hasn’t returned, despite the fact
he hasn’t stopped running the whole time.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.920
In ‘Runaround’, Asimov introduces
his famous three laws of robotics

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:02.020
three laws embedded in the programming of all robots
designed to maximise safety for humans and robots.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:09.620
Law one: a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.280
Law two: a robot must obey the orders
given it by human beings

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.260
except where such orders would conflict
with the First Law.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.400
Law three: a robot must protect its own existence

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.960
as long as such protection does not conflict
with the first or second Laws.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:34.900
Eventually, the engineers venture out onto
the boiling Mercury landscape in search of Speedy

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.640
and find him running in circles
by the selenium pool.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.260
It doesn’t take them long to figure out what’s happened.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.760
Speedy’s become caught
between law two and law three.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.580
There are unexpected corrosive gases around the pool.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:57.080
This activates law three which directs Speedy to protect his own existence and run away from the pool.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.660
But when he’s far enough from the pool,
the danger subsides and law two kicks in,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.540
directing Speedy to obey his order to collect selenium.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.600
So Speedy runs back to the pool.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.220
He’s stuck in an endless loop

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:17.240
—&nbsp;one that will soon have life-or-death
consequences for Donovan and Powell.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:23.820
Later on, Speedy’s depicted offering endless
apologies and feeling scared about being judged.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:30.040
But he’s told that it wasn’t his fault — he wasn’t responsible for his flawed programming.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:35.360
Just like Speedy, we appear to come
hardwired with deeply flawed programming

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.380
that obstructs our ability to process reality

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.680
— with substantial consequences for us
and those we interact with.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.918
One of many intriguing and unsettling lines
of research in this area

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:52.000
concerns the human tendency
to infer personality traits from faces.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.280
Absurd as it seems, based solely on
the physical structure of people’s faces

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.020
we instinctively score them on
a range of psychological characteristics

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:08.180
— including likeability, trustworthiness,
competence and aggressiveness.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.520
And we make these judgements within
as little as 100 milliseconds.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:17.100
This has huge implications
for human relationships of every stripe

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.640
from choice of life partners
to the political direction of nations.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.720
Research by Todorov and his colleagues

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.540
suggests that inferences of competence that
occurred within a one-second exposure

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:34.840
to the faces of electoral candidates
could predict the outcomes of elections.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.060
Short of having clones run for each political party

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.040
it’s not clear how this kind of facial 
prejudice could be cancelled.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.640
Todorov has commented:

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.980
‘We decide very quickly whether a person
possesses many of the traits we feel are important

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:54.980
such as likeability and competence, even though
we have not exchanged a single word with them.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:00.540
It appears we are hard-wired to draw these
inferences in a fast, unreflective way.’

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.180
His research with Engell and Haxby
using functional magnetic resonance imaging

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:08.900
suggests that the amygdala
automatically codes faces

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.180
according to features associated
with untrustworthiness.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:17.640
And this is just one example
of a hardwired human bias.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.700
Psychologists have identified dozens of biases

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:27.340
—&nbsp;involving memory, visual recognition, decision-making and social perception and behaviour —

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:33.360
all operating outside of our awareness,
and therefore outside our conscious control

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.040
all actively distorting the way we process reality

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:44.080
introducing errors that directly contribute
to delusions and injustices of every scale.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:50.420
It’s only through our own meticulous study that we’ve learned about these hidden psychological glitches.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:55.120
And it’s only through learning about them
that we’ve begun to be able to look out for them

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.160
and to try and compensate for the errors they produce.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.640
So. In theological terms, who’s to blame
for this flawed programming?

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:10.560
We’re not talking about random cases of birth defects that might be put down to environment accidents.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.780
We’re talking about errors resulting
from normal brain function.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:20.060
In Asimov’s ‘Runaround’, Speedy’s creators step forward

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.820
and acknowledge responsibility
for his flawed programming,

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.540
reassuring him he’s not to blame.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:32.860
If we were designed by some creator,
shouldn’t it step forward and do same?

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:40.720
Instead, we’re left in the same guilt-ridden, apologetic state Speedy was in before his creators’ reassurances

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.740
— anxious about being judged as defective

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:50.840
by a creator that, if it existed, would be
directly responsible for those defects.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:57.400
Many of us — including myself — have spent a number of years looking up to some imaginary divine dictator

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.900
in awe of its greatness.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:05.380
The very phrase ‘God is great’ has become
a mantra for some religious groups.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:13.320
But being great isn’t an absolute property,
no more than being large or being fast.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.400
It’s a relative property.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.140
The word ‘great’ indicates that something
is substantially above average.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.820
If this mythical creator had created beings in its own image

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.560
it would be considered entirely
unexceptional by its creation.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.180
In theological terms, the greatness
and power of this mythical creator

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:40.140
rests purely on its decision to make its creation
so small and powerless relative to itself.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:46.380
What do we think about those who have
to diminish others in order to feel great?

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:52.020
Like recovering from domestic abuse,
recovering from religion can take time.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:58.540
Even when we’ve realised on a rational level that we have no reason whatsoever to believe in any gods

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.200
our imaginations sometimes take a while to catch up.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.040
We sometimes have to contend with
persistent negative thoughts

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:15.340
deliberately encouraged by our indoctrinators, designed
to make us feel bad, defective, small, miserable.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:22.540
One of those images is that of a mythical judge,
meting out sentences and punishments from its bench.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:27.700
But if it existed, this judge would have
no place sitting on the bench.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.060
Its place would be in the dock

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.240
on a charge so wicked that no earthly criminal
could hope to come near it.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.080
The charge of creating sickness.
