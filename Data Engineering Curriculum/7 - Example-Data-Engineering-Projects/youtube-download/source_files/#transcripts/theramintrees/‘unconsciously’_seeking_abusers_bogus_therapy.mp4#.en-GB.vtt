00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.400
People who manage to escape

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.800
from abusive religious groups,&nbsp;
families and personal relationships

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600
sometimes find themselves repeatedly&nbsp;
falling into similar abusive environments.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.280
It can be extremely demoralising.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.760
We ask ourselves, How did we end up here again?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.080
Adding to the confusion, some&nbsp;
mental health professionals

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.160
will insist the reason we find&nbsp;
ourselves in this poisonous spin cycle

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.840
is that unconsciously we’re&nbsp;
attracted to abusive individuals;

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.760
some secret part of us is&nbsp;
actively seeking them out.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.520
We’re told that on some&nbsp;
level we’re actively looking

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.160
for people who resemble our past abusers.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.480
In previous work, I’ve looked&nbsp;
at some of the problems

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.880
with appeals to unconscious processes.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.280
As I’ve noted, spurious claims&nbsp;
about unconscious impulses

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.440
aren’t confined to the world of therapy.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.480
They crop up in the social&nbsp;
sciences and social media.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.400
But it’s in the therapeutic&nbsp;
arena that bogus speculations

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.760
about our unconscious motives&nbsp;
are possibly most potent.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.600
Clients look to therapists for support and insight

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.840
and many clients can become&nbsp;
extremely vulnerable to suggestion.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.920
For that reason, therapists need to exercise&nbsp;
caution about the ideas they express

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.840
and how forcefully they express them.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.560
Not all therapists do.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.280
Over the years people have&nbsp;
shared many personal experiences

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.320
in individual or group therapy&nbsp;
in which it was claimed

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.000
they were bringing their misfortunes, their&nbsp;
abuse, even their physical illnesses on themselves

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.920
through their own unconscious wishes.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.320
Effectively, they were being told&nbsp;
they had a double consciousness.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.120
Two separate functioning minds.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.520
Beyond the one they were familiar&nbsp;
with from direct experience

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.680
there was a second mind operating&nbsp;
entirely outside of their awareness

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680
hidden behind an impenetrable veil.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.200
A mind with its own separate&nbsp;
desires and motivations.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.400
Like some unseen backseat driver

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.680
it could take over and steer&nbsp;
them in the direction it wanted.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.160
Any conscious decision could be overruled if it&nbsp;
conflicted with the backseat driver’s agenda.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.000
When that happened, without even realising it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.800
individuals might start sidelining&nbsp;
or sabotaging their intended goals

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.120
to satisfy the wishes of their secret mind.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.240
Targets of abuse who were consciously&nbsp;
determined to avoid abusers

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.120
could be hypnotically compelled to seek them out

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.600
in response to some nonconscious impulse.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.120
Maybe their secret mind still&nbsp;
had feelings for a past abuser

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.200
and wanted to find a substitute to&nbsp;
help them re-enact that relationship

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.120
hoping for a better outcome.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.400
Maybe their secret mind was haunted

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.200
by a guilty memory and wanted to be punished.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.040
In the grip of this undetectable influence

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.120
individuals could then find themselves

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.320
repeatedly sleepwalking&nbsp;
into abusive relationships.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.840
Or so some therapists would have them believe.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.960
Folks from certain religious&nbsp;
backgrounds might spot a resemblance

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.360
between this conjecture about the unconscious

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.600
and conjecture about demonic possession.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.680
In both cases, there’s an&nbsp;
attempt to explain behaviour

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.080
by appealing to an inaccessible mind.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.960
Because of that inaccessibility

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.120
any assertions made about the motives

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.440
of these supposed hidden minds&nbsp;
are unfalsifiable speculations.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.400
Peddlers of demons are free to&nbsp;
posit any demonic desire they like

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.040
— and peddlers of the unconscious&nbsp;
can posit any unconscious intention —

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.920
all without any fear of empirical refutation.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.560
In both cases, clients are&nbsp;
expected to accept their assertions

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.440
based purely on fallacious appeals to authority.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.880
Their assertions are true because they say so.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.800
The concept of unconscious motives might&nbsp;
appeal vividly to our imaginations.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.600
It can certainly make for entertaining fiction.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.880
Alfred Hitchcock revisited the&nbsp;
concept as a central plot device

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.320
in various films including&nbsp;
Spellbound, Psycho and Marnie.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.360
But it has no place in therapy.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.160
There’s a common misconception

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.400
that therapy’s about coming up with&nbsp;
dazzling psychological theories;

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.880
wildly inventive counterintuitive leaps.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.200
In fact therapy is about&nbsp;
straightforward detective work.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.160
Therapists and their clients&nbsp;
form an investigative alliance.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.920
With focused attention, they work together

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.280
to pick up solid practical clues and build them

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.760
into an accurate evidence-based picture

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.320
that illuminates the substantive issues at play.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.760
When we ground ourselves in&nbsp;
disciplined empirical investigation

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.840
big problems quickly emerge with&nbsp;
the notion that cycles of abuse

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.640
must indicate some underlying&nbsp;
attraction to abusers.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.160
Many targets who’ve repeatedly found&nbsp;
themselves in abusive relationships

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.480
report that their abusers behaved&nbsp;
completely differently when they first met.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.960
Often it wasn’t so much that they&nbsp;
came as wolves in sheep’s clothing.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.480
Many abusers were more like wolves behind mirrors.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.920
They appeared to like all the&nbsp;
same things as the target.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.920
Share all the same values.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.560
Whether the abusive parties&nbsp;
were individuals or groups

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.200
at the start of the relationship, targets were&nbsp;
presented with a reflection of themselves.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.520
The mirror would only be dropped&nbsp;
when the target had been reeled in.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.000
So were these targets attracted to&nbsp;
people who reminded them of past abusers

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.080
or people like themselves.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.040
The evidence points unambiguously to the latter.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.920
The fallacious assumption repeatedly made

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.840
by proponents of the unconscious

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.640
is that if you keep having the same experience

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.320
some part of you must want it.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.840
But we don’t have to look far for&nbsp;
examples that refute this assumption.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.360
For instance, we wouldn’t assume an individual

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.880
who’d been repeatedly financially&nbsp;
scammed by con artists

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.520
was ‘unconsciously’ seeking those abusers out.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.120
We wouldn’t suggest there was some secret desire

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.320
to re-enact the original&nbsp;
scam with a positive outcome.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.320
Instead, we’d recognise that the fact the&nbsp;
individual kept getting repeatedly scammed

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.240
probably meant there were ongoing&nbsp;
vulnerabilities that weren’t being addressed.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.160
Maybe the individual was too trusting or&nbsp;
unaware of some important warning signs.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.160
We’d be looking to see how we&nbsp;
might help build better defences.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.800
And yet when it comes to abusive relationships

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.920
for some therapists, the standard supposition&nbsp;
is that targets of these con artists

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.480
must be driven to replay the past.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.920
It’s worth taking a moment to address&nbsp;
a couple of straw man arguments

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.840
that I’ve had put to me on this subject.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.160
Am I saying:

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.320
‘No one was ever drawn to individuals&nbsp;
they believed to be dangerous or abusive?’

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.440
No.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.920
During his public trial in the late 1970s

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.560
serial rapist and killer Ted Bundy&nbsp;
amassed a sizeable female following.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.280
Many of them turned up at his court hearings.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.560
Some went as far as deliberately&nbsp;
arranging their hair

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.440
in the same distinctive style as Bundy’s victims.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.840
Some believed he was innocent.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.040
But others had a more complex response.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.600
They believed Bundy was guilty

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.720
but believed they would be safe with him.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.080
They imagined that unlike the women he’d killed

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.840
they would somehow win him over.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.240
Am I saying:

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.880
‘No one was ever drawn to individuals&nbsp;
who reminded them of abusive loved ones?’

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.360
No. Somebody I used to know married a man

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.640
explicitly because he reminded&nbsp;
her of her dead father.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.000
Her marriage became a replay of her childhood.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.120
The fights. The broken promises.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.160
The random absences as he disappeared for days.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.880
His failure to hold down any job,&nbsp;
dragging them into increasing debt.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.200
She confessed that she struggled&nbsp;
with constant loneliness

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.000
overwork and financial hardship.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.800
But she said, from the moment they met

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.960
it was like having her father back.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.280
And she didn’t want to lose that feeling again.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.360
The fundamental point about Bundy’s followers

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.360
and the women who married her father

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.080
is that their attraction to abusers was conscious.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.280
They saw the menace in their midst

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.960
and chose to walk towards it.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.960
That makes their situation entirely different

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.640
from cases where targets are drawn in

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.200
by deception and fail to see the menace.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.320
I want to present some real-life&nbsp;
examples of individuals

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.400
who were told they were unconsciously&nbsp;
attracted to abusive situations.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.320
I’ll be looking at how each of them pushed past

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.280
that fallacious diagnosis and&nbsp;
discovered concrete practical answers

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.680
that helped them break their abusive patterns.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.000
These examples also illustrate&nbsp;
the huge differences

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.960
that can exist between one&nbsp;
target of abuse and the next.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.800
Different vulnerabilities,&nbsp;
different response styles

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.520
and different reasons for tolerating abuse.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:10:03.840
As always, details are&nbsp;
disguised to preserve anonymity.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.440
Adam was born into a family dominated

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.280
by a malignant narcissistic&nbsp;
matriarch, prone to violent rages.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.200
She nicknames him ‘the clown’&nbsp;
and routinely threatens

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.720
to send him away to the circus.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.000
At the same time, she does everything&nbsp;
she can to stop him ever leaving

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.160
sabotaging any sign of independence.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.360
Despite her efforts, Adam eventually&nbsp;
finds a steady job and moves out.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.440
After signing up to a dating&nbsp;
app, he’s approached by Diane.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.560
She’s like no one he’s ever&nbsp;
known. Kind, empathic, generous.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.160
Before he knows it, they’re married.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
And her caring persona cracks.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.880
She becomes cruel and mocking and&nbsp;
starts flying into violent rages.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.080
Adam feels like he’s married a stranger.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.800
But he stands firmly by his marriage vows

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.520
even when Diane begins to&nbsp;
flaunt a string of lovers.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.960
Finally she divorces him for another man.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.040
After the split, Adam is pursued by Fiona

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.240
a coworker who supported him&nbsp;
tirelessly through his divorce.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.800
Before he knows it, they’re married.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.280
With nauseating deja vu he watches her&nbsp;
kind demeanour dissolve into violent rages.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.960
Feeling devastated and trapped, Adam signs up

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.080
for six sessions at a counselling charity.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.280
His therapist tells him he’s&nbsp;
drawn to abusive partners

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.440
because he’s looking for women like his mother.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.120
On a symbolic level he’s trying&nbsp;
to win his mother’s love.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.080
Adam says his wives were nothing like&nbsp;
his mother before he married them.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.240
But his therapist says he would’ve picked&nbsp;
up on their real natures unconsciously.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.720
He bows to her professional opinion.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.840
After six sessions talking about his&nbsp;
mother, Adam emerges none the wiser.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.400
Still desperate for a solution, he&nbsp;
decides to continue with therapy

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.880
and engages a long-term private therapist

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.080
who he’s surprised to find takes a&nbsp;
very different empirical approach.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.120
She explores two practical questions.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.800
First, what factors drew&nbsp;
Adam into these marriages?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.240
Second, when he realised they were abusive

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.760
what kept him in these marriages?

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.920
Together they identified some of the&nbsp;
actual issues driving Adam’s abusive cycle.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.960
First, they acknowledged a&nbsp;
simple truth: Adam was deceived.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.440
Both of his wives had misled him

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.920
with a string of lies and misrepresentations.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.560
There was no substantive reason to&nbsp;
believe some secret part of his mind

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.000
had seen through their&nbsp;
deception to their true natures

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.880
or made any connection&nbsp;
between them and his mother.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
In looking at how he’d been manipulated

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.600
Adam recalled how overwhelmed he’d&nbsp;
felt when he began seeing them.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.560
In the rare moments they&nbsp;
weren’t physically together

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.880
they’d be constantly phoning and messaging him.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.760
They blocked out everything and everyone else.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.200
At the time he read their intensity as love.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.720
Now he could see how they were&nbsp;
giving him no space to think.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.440
Adam also recognised he had a&nbsp;
problem handling positive attention.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.280
It aroused a jumble of feelings.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.880
He enjoyed it. And it made him squirm.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.880
He felt grateful and obligated

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.200
as if he was being given too much of something;

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.720
building up some kind of debt.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.880
He wanted to run from it. And wanted more of it.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.880
In this conflicted state, he&nbsp;
felt constantly off balance.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.880
Many targets of abuse struggle&nbsp;
with positive attention.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.040
They might flee from a compliment.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.520
This kind of discomfort can&nbsp;
act like a signpost to abusers

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.920
reading: ‘Not accustomed to being treated well’.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.600
In the process of identifying&nbsp;
these kinds of factors

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.680
the mystery of how Adam found himself

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.480
married to complete strangers began to make sense.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.520
This practical awareness also helped&nbsp;
immunise him from future repetition.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.240
When Adam reflected on what kept&nbsp;
him in these abusive marriages

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.880
his reflex response was that he had no choice.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.840
He’d made solemn marriage vows he couldn’t break.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.320
Adam’s therapist explored where&nbsp;
this rigid thinking came from.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.000
Adam recognised his father’s voice.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.760
From an early age, Adam had strongly&nbsp;
aligned himself with his father

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.840
who he saw as the good parent,&nbsp;
and aspired to uphold his values.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.840
A value frequently repeated by his&nbsp;
father was: Never break a promise.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.680
Thinking further back, Adam could hear&nbsp;
his grandfather’s voice in there too.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.440
Both men saw divorce as something deeply shameful.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.680
Adam had absorbed these values as absolute law.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.960
Now he could see how they’d kept him&nbsp;
imprisoned in two abusive marriages.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.080
In reassessing his father’s values,&nbsp;
he began to reassess his father.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.560
He used to see him as a man of&nbsp;
superhuman integrity and patience.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.840
Now he just seemed trapped —

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.520
straightjacketed by the same&nbsp;
rigid over-simplistic values

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.960
he’d passed down to Adam.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.480
As Adam became aware of the actual&nbsp;
issues driving his cycle of abuse

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.400
he was able to start addressing them.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.360
No longer feeling obliged to keep&nbsp;
his marriage vows, he left Fiona.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.760
His mother tried to shame him&nbsp;
over his two failed marriages.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.040
But Adam said he preferred to think&nbsp;
of them as two successful divorces.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.120
Cally wrote to me a couple of years ago.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.280
She was also in her second abusive&nbsp;
relationship when she entered therapy.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.960
Cally was raised in a religious high-control group

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.360
that governed almost every area of her life

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.800
from social to educational to professional.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.200
When she began to resist that&nbsp;
control, she was reprimanded.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.680
When she persisted, she was shunned —

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.320
abandoned by her entire community,&nbsp;
including all her family and friends.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.840
In the unimaginable desolation of losing&nbsp;
a lifetime of relationships overnight

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.880
the single consolation she held onto was&nbsp;
that she’d never be controlled again.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.240
In the gruelling process of rebuilding&nbsp;
her life from nothing, she met Sean.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.840
In no time, she was completely under his control.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.960
When he first began to take over

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.120
she made some attempts to stand her ground.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.440
When he didn’t back down

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.480
she was horrified to see&nbsp;
herself sink into compliance.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.600
She stayed with Sean for a few years

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.080
before growing hints of physical&nbsp;
violence drove her to secretly organise

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.760
a new job and apartment and one day disappear.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.040
As Cally began to rebuild her life&nbsp;
for the second time, she met Manny.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.200
This time things would be different.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.320
In no time at all, they were the same.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.760
Cally engaged a therapist who told her

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.240
she was attracted to controlling individuals

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.160
because some part of her wanted to&nbsp;
recreate her controlling upbringing.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.320
He said she equated being&nbsp;
controlled with being loved.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.480
When Cally rejected this idea, he became insistent

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.680
and told her she needed to face&nbsp;
her desire to be controlled.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.440
As Cally noted, leaving a controlling therapist

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.320
was a lot more straightforward&nbsp;
than leaving a controlling partner.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.480
Cally found a new therapist&nbsp;
who helped her identify

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.640
some of the actual issues of the situation.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.280
The central issue was that since&nbsp;
losing everyone she’d ever loved

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.760
she now had intense autophobia —&nbsp;
a crushing fear of being alone.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.320
That phobia had various effects.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.200
Cally was constantly desperate for company.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.680
She was never unavailable.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.160
And always keen to stay a little longer.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.640
Cally’s therapist noted her anguish&nbsp;
each week when her time was up.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.320
This insatiable hunger for company left&nbsp;
her extremely vulnerable to exploitation.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.640
Her fear of being alone also&nbsp;
affected her choice of company.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.520
She tended to favour individuals&nbsp;
who, like her, were always available.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.960
A big part of what attracted her to Sean and Manny

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.640
was that they’d never seemed to want to leave.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.960
She could see now it wasn’t a&nbsp;
great basis for choosing a partner.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.400
Cally’s autophobia severely compromised&nbsp;
her boundaries and her standards.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.440
She said she felt like water around rock.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.840
Other people had all the power.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.640
She hated being controlled.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.160
She didn’t equate it with love.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.560
But she endured it because&nbsp;
being alone felt even worse.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.000
Cally’s therapy was about becoming&nbsp;
comfortable with her own company.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Not quick or easy work.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.200
But it gave her back her&nbsp;
power and broke the cycle.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.800
After leaving Manny, she found she was in no rush

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.320
to get involved with someone else.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.840
For the first time in her life, she felt free.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.280
Finn’s story illustrates the lengths

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.920
some therapists go to to&nbsp;
confirm their assumptions.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.480
Finn enters therapy after leaving&nbsp;
a malignant political group.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.800
It’s not the first malignant&nbsp;
ideological community he’s joined.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.080
And his experiences follow&nbsp;
an almost identical pattern.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.920
The first is an evangelical religious sect

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.640
he’s recruited into by some&nbsp;
teachers at his school.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:33.120
The joyful buzz exuded by its members&nbsp;
contrasts sharply with his dull home life

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.520
and he throws himself into his new community.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.120
But gradually he begins to notice something’s off.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.040
He discovers that various social&nbsp;
prejudices are being promoted.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.320
Innocent groups are said to&nbsp;
be demonically possessed.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.800
Finn throws himself into&nbsp;
mending his precious community

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.040
taking a stand against these poisonous ideas.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.040
In response, it’s suggested&nbsp;
he’s having a crisis of faith.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.200
When he continues to speak&nbsp;
out he’s told he’s possessed.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.840
Finn persists until finally he’s expelled.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.480
Finn joins a spiritual healing group.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.840
It’s an extremely supportive atmosphere

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.240
and he throws himself into his new community.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.760
But gradually he begins to notice something’s off.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.080
The leaders can be aggressively&nbsp;
patronising and infantilising.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.720
Finn sees some of his fellow members

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.280
regress into timid compliant children

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.120
afraid to disagree with the leaders.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.640
He throws himself into mending&nbsp;
his precious community.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.120
In response, he’s told he&nbsp;
has psychological issues.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.520
The leaders suggest he’s disrupting the group

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.200
because on an unconscious level

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.680
he wants to make himself an outsider

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.840
just like he did in his evangelical group.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.680
Finn persists until finally he’s expelled.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.640
Finn joins a political group.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.920
The members are passionate&nbsp;
about truth, peace and justice

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.520
echoing his own values

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.840
and he throws himself into his new community.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.760
But gradually he begins to notice something’s off.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.240
There’s a bullying tribalistic mentality.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.040
Dissenting opinions are punished

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.840
with verbal abuse and wild smear campaigns.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.160
Finn throws himself into&nbsp;
mending his precious community.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.320
In response, he’s labelled an enemy and a fraud.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.000
Finn persists until finally he’s expelled.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.960
After listening to Finn’s accounts

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.160
his therapist says what&nbsp;
she’s hearing is a little boy

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.760
trying over and over to&nbsp;
mend his own abusive family.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.400
Finn says his family wasn’t abusive.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.600
To his bewilderment, she contradicts him.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.160
She says her experience tells&nbsp;
her his family was abusive.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.080
She says his extreme persistence

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.160
in trying to mend these abusive groups

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.320
indicates there’s something deeper going on here.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.560
She tells him memories of abuse&nbsp;
can sometimes be repressed —

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.840
hidden from the conscious mind&nbsp;
because they’re too painful.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.800
Finn insists his family wasn’t abusive.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.560
But she won’t have it.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.880
It was in that moment

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.240
watching himself fighting to be heard

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.240
by someone he was paying to listen

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.840
that Finn saw the driving&nbsp;
force behind his abusive cycle.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.200
He ended the session and didn’t return.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.440
Some time later he found a&nbsp;
name for that driving force.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.280
The sunk cost trap refers to our tendency

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.000
to continue some activity or undertaking

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.400
solely on the basis that we’ve already made

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.320
some significant investment in it —

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.120
specifically, an investment we can’t get back.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.680
Hence the word ‘sunk’ meaning unrecoverable.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.880
The thing we invest in could be anything —

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.400
a business, a relationship, an ideological group.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.560
The resources we invest could take various forms —

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.760
time, money, effort, emotion.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.800
Finn had no reverse gear.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.600
He lived by the motto ‘I’ve&nbsp;
started so I’ll finish’.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.160
Once he committed himself to something

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.840
he would see it through to the end.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.720
Whatever it was.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.600
From joining an ideological group

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.160
to reading a book or watching a movie.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.680
He hated the idea of giving up on any project

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.840
he’d made some kind of investment in.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.680
It would feel like the chunk of his life

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.320
he’d spent on the project&nbsp;
had been a complete waste.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.760
Of course the result of stubbornly&nbsp;
completing every project he started

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.400
was that he ended up wasting&nbsp;
so much more of his life

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.520
on unfulfilling enterprises&nbsp;
than he ever would have

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.360
if he’d just allowed himself to let go.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.400
Finn recognised that part of the reason&nbsp;
he repeatedly fell into this trap

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.760
was his tendency to throw&nbsp;
himself into things impulsively

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.920
on the basis of a positive first impression.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.760
He needed to ease in slowly with eyes open.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.320
But most importantly, if he&nbsp;
began to notice something was off

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.880
instead of automatically going into mending mode

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.680
he needed to soberly assess whether&nbsp;
to continue or end his investment.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.040
As Finn said, he needed to recognise

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.760
when he was just rearranging&nbsp;
deck chairs on the Titanic

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.840
and jump ship.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.800
I’ll end with Muna’s story.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.080
Muna was a client I saw when I&nbsp;
was working at a therapy charity.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.080
I took over her case when her previous&nbsp;
therapist left the organisation.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.640
Muna came from a large family&nbsp;
dominated by an abusive father

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.360
whose drinking and gambling left them destitute.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.560
He died in her early teenage years

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.960
and the children were split&nbsp;
into different foster homes.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.520
Muna came to therapy in the&nbsp;
aftermath of an abusive relationship

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.960
with an alcoholic gambler who’d&nbsp;
leeched off of her for months

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.360
to sustain his addictions before&nbsp;
disappearing, leaving her destitute.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.680
He told Muna that in life there&nbsp;
were drivers and passengers.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.360
He was a driver.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.200
She was a passenger.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.480
In our first couple of sessions, Muna offered&nbsp;
very little information about herself.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.280
When she did offer something, she’d pause

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.120
and ask: ‘What does that say about me?’

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.080
Each time I’d tell her I didn’t&nbsp;
know and ask her what she thought.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.600
She’d say she didn’t know either.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.080
Some months later I found out

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.320
my predecessor had been in the habit&nbsp;
of over-analysing whatever Muna said.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.120
Everything was given some interpretation.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.160
Muna had been waiting for me to do the same.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.120
As she realised I didn’t operate that way

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.120
she slowly began to take up more space.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.760
She said my predecessor told her&nbsp;
she’d let this abuser into her life

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.360
because she wanted her father back.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.600
I asked if she thought that was true.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.840
She stalled for a long time&nbsp;
and asked me what I thought.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.920
I gave the question back.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.720
Finally, she said no.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.240
She’d never wanted her father back.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.240
After another long pause, watching my reaction

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.240
she said she was relieved when he died.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.240
She said he terrified her.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.720
She remembered how some of her siblings

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.880
managed to avoid his violent rages

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.240
by running out of the house.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.800
But she would just stand there

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.800
rooted to the spot and take it.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.840
She said she felt like a seahorse.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.520
She’d seen a documentary&nbsp;
once about Chinese medicine.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.040
They used dried seahorses to&nbsp;
treat all kinds of conditions.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.680
She remembered seeing a diver

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.720
collecting the seahorses from&nbsp;
the underwater plant beds.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.360
They did nothing to defend themselves.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.120
They just froze.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.640
Like they were hoping they wouldn’t be seen.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.800
They were easy pickings.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.280
That’s how she saw herself.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.240
With her father, with&nbsp;
bullies at school or at work.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.600
She just froze and took it.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.560
And it was the same with her recent abuser.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.280
She hadn’t wanted anything to do with him.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.800
He just came in, took what he wanted and left.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.960
If he hadn’t left, she’d&nbsp;
still be taking his abuse.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.800
Muna was stuck in a maladaptive freeze response.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.360
Like fight and flight responses,&nbsp;
freezing is a survival strategy.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.680
In the face of certain threats

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.520
instinctively immobilising ourselves

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.280
can sometimes help protect us from harm.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.760
But it becomes maladaptive when it&nbsp;
serves to make us more vulnerable.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.560
Many targets of abuse become stuck

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.560
in one fixed reflex strategy in&nbsp;
response to conflict and threats

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.400
always fighting, always flying&nbsp;
or, like Muna, always freezing

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.320
even when it works against them.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.240
Because of the automatic habitual&nbsp;
nature of these responses

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.840
it can be hard to move out of them.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.480
It can take lots of physical practice&nbsp;
to build alternative responses

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.720
into the individual’s behavioural repertoire.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.240
Muna’s therapy focused on cultivating the ability

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.560
to take action to defend her boundaries.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.880
In addition to our sessions

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.440
she decided to sign up for&nbsp;
some assertiveness classes.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.080
She found a great group and&nbsp;
progressed in huge strides.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.760
She said she found assertiveness addictive

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.640
and she’d delight in reporting real life incidents

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.400
where she put her training into action.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.440
In our final session

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.080
I remarked that Muna was no longer a seahorse.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.840
She said no — she was still a seahorse.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.840
But a seahorse who’d learned kung fu.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.600
Therapy is straightforward detective work.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.560
The therapist and client form&nbsp;
an investigative alliance

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.520
to examine accessible evidence and&nbsp;
figure out together what’s going on.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.080
Therapists who try to tell clients&nbsp;
what their unconscious motives

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.280
are violate that alliance by venturing&nbsp;
into unsubstantiated speculation

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.400
on bogus material to which neither the&nbsp;
client nor the therapist has access.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.960
In fact I consider the&nbsp;
practice of making assertions

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.480
about clients’ unconscious motives&nbsp;
to be a form of gaslighting.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.560
Clients are being encouraged&nbsp;
to doubt their own mind.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.240
Thankfully much of the therapy world

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.120
has firmly distanced itself&nbsp;
from these outdated practices —

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.880
sad vestiges from the infancy of talking therapy

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.120
when some astounding abuses were&nbsp;
routinely imposed on clients.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.440
Adam, Cally, Finn and Muna were all told

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.480
they unconsciously wanted to&nbsp;
re-enact their abusive past.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.680
Not only was this assertion&nbsp;
unsubstantiated in every case

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.160
it also served as a huge distraction

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.840
from the actual issues driving&nbsp;
each person’s abusive cycle.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.920
It was only when they moved&nbsp;
past that bogus assertion

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.800
that they were able to start&nbsp;
getting to grips with those issues.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.520
Breaking abusive patterns&nbsp;
often involves becoming aware

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.640
of things we’re doing&nbsp;
automatically, without reflection.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.640
Each individual here had distinctive&nbsp;
vulnerabilities not shared by the others.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.880
The key to their respective recoveries&nbsp;
lay in identifying and addressing

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.680
the specific vulnerabilities&nbsp;
operating in each case.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.480
With that knowledge they were&nbsp;
able to end their cycles of abuse.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.120
And I would encourage anyone to&nbsp;
follow their brilliant example

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.840
and ditch any therapist who tells you&nbsp;
you’re unconsciously seeking abusers.
