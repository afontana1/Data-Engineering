00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.900
There comes a point, 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.700
in the meatier discussions I occasionally have with theists, 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.700
where it feels like the main meal is over. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.200
We’ve consumed the particular arguments before us. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.900
And the time comes to observe the postprandial outcome. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.900
These vary hugely. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.900
One outcome is atheism. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.400
The other party realises they’ve crossed that line, 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.700
and no longer believe in any gods.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.400
Another outcome is silence. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
The other party vanishes, for reasons unknown.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900
A third outcome is the parting handshake. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.700
The other party expresses appreciation for the discussion, 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.700
but decides to withdraw from it, for whatever personal reasons.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.900
A fourth outcome is the parting shot. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.900
The other party exits with an abusive remark, 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.900
revealing a hitherto concealed aggression. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.900
It’s worth noting that over the years a small percentage of these folks 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.900
have got back in touch down the line to share with me 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.200
that their outburst reflected a state of panic, or even dread, 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.100
when they began to perceive the problems in what they were defending.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.400
A fifth outcome is the unmasking. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.900
Here, it’s revealed, intentionally or not, 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.700
that the ‘theist’ was actually an atheist playing devil’s advocate. 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.900
But the outcome I’d like to talk about here is one I’ve come to call the refuge. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.500
Here, despite acknowledging my counter-arguments, 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.900
the other party suddenly takes refuge in an assertion 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.900
that they possess some special insight as a theist 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that I just don’t as an atheist. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.000
Some call it a sixth sense. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.500
Others use different analogies — 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.400
a common one compares atheism to colourblindness. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.700
But when we look more closely at these ideas, 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.400
they just don’t stack up. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500
In fact, far from offering refuge, 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.900
they backfire against theism, actively highlighting its flaws.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.200
I want to take a look at this refuge response. 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.400
I’ll focus on the colourblindness analogy, 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.900
but the problems apply to similar claims of an extra sense. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then I’d like to talk about a couple of experiments 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.700
that lay bare just how easily we can be convinced 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.000
we possess some special insight that other folks are missing.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.400
The comparison of atheism with colourblindness comes in two primary forms. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.400
One asserts that arguing with atheists is like trying 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.900
to convince a colourblind person of the existence of colour. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.500
Another variation asserts that arguing with atheists is like 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
trying to convey the beauty of a rainbow to a colourblind person. 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.500
These are obviously two very different cruxes. 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.500
So let’s see them through.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.900
How would you convince me that people experienced colour, 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.400
if I couldn’t experience it myself? 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.900
Well, how about this: 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.500
paint each of five identical objects a different colour — 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.900
blue, green, yellow, orange, and red — 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.500
making sure the colours have identical luminosity, 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.200
so that to me they appear the same shade of grey. 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.200
Label them according to colour with the labels facing me, 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.900
and get members of the public to identify the colours. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.200
We could switch the order round to add a layer of randomisation. 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.900
With appropriate experimental controls, 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.900
when the colours were reported with overwhelming accuracy, 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.200
I’d be persuaded that people were experiencing 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.900
a reliable, consistent phenomenon. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.400
So, if arguing with atheists was indeed like 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.400
convincing a colourblind person about colour perception, 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.900
it would be a pretty straightforward matter, wouldn’t it? 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.400
To see why it isn’t, let’s continue the colourblindness analogy, 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.900
and look at some responses more aligned with what theism offers:

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.900
What if a crowd of individuals showed you 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
their own ancient books defining colour, 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.200
each of which contradicted the definition in everyone else’s book. 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.500
Some books said there were many colours. 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.500
Others proposed only one colour, 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.500
although the concept of that colour varied hugely 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.900
according to which book you read. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.500
Bizarrely, some books claimed there was one unchanging colour 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.400
but then described that colour changing into 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.400
something completely different over the course of the book. 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.200
But one thing everyone agreed on was that 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.900
you just had to accept that they had the truth 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.900
and everyone else had got it wrong.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.500
If you were colourblind, would you be convinced 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.900
that these people are perceiving a reliable, consistent phenomenon? 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.200
Even if we take away the contradictions, 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.500
all we’d have is a group of folks who agree on a definition. 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.900
No one’s demonstrated that the thing to which that definition refers 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.500
has any manifestation in reality. 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.100
Say we define pixies as invisible beings that open all the flower petals. 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200
When we see flowers opening their petals, 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.500
is that then evidence of pixies? 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.200
No. We’ve started out with an unfalsifiable assumption: 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.900
that the process of opening petals 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.900
requires an external supernatural agent to make it work. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.500
These kinds of assumptions were widespread among our ancestors, 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.900
who believed that everything from thunder 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.400
to the motion of astronomical bodies had to be driven 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.400
by various supernatural agents to make them work. 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.900
For instance, it might be claimed that 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.500
the sun was drawn across the sky on a chariot 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.900
by a deity dedicated to that specific function. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.500
These were definitions that everyone within a given culture agreed on; 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.900
definitions woven deeply into the fabric of their belief systems. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.200
But as humans produced more accurate models of how things worked, 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.900
the gods started disappearing. 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.400
If you believe in any supernatural agents, 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.200
I’d like to invite you to reflect privately for a moment 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.500
on the processes you believe 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.500
those supernatural agents control in your life. 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.900
Do they engineer coincidences? 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.900
Do they orchestrate events to teach you lessons? 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.200
In your private reflection, ask yourselves, 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.400
do any of the events you’re thinking of really require supernatural agents? 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.900
I’ll come back to this later on.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.200
But for now, let’s continue with the colourblindness analogy 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.500
and look at some more hypothetical responses from the coloursighted.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.900
What if they said you just haven’t tried hard enough to see colour?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.200
What if they told you you first have to believe in colour, then you’ll see it?

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.900
What if they asserted that nothing made sense without colour?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.400
What if they claimed that, secretly, you already believed colour existed — 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.200
you were just angry with it?

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.900
If you were colourblind, what would you make of these assertions? 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.400
Not much, I suspect. 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.900
But these are the kinds of evasions and sideshows 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.900
that I receive as an atheist all the time, in place of evidence.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.500
Let’s see them through. 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.400
I can’t count the times it’s been put to me 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.500
that I can't see gods because I haven’t tried hard enough — 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.200
obviously, not something you’d say to a colourblind person. 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.200
The circular nature of this argument is exposed 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.500
when I ask what proof there is for it. 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.900
I’m told the proof I haven’t tried hard enough is that I can’t see gods. 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.200
This kind of circle does have a ring of validity in certain circumstances. 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.400
Playing Chopin requires sustained effort. 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.400
Practice generates incremental improvements 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.900
in accuracy, speed, emotional expression. 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.500
With other tasks, sustained effort leads to a eureka moment 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.500
where a skill is suddenly acquired. 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.500
An example would be stereograms. 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.900
These are pictures composed of repeating patterns. 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.200
For those of us who have reasonable binocular vision, 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.500
it’s possible to defocus, stare into the middle distance, 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.200
and watch the repeated patterns coalesce 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.900
to reveal a hidden 3-dimensional object. 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.500
Takes a while to get the knack, but once you get it, you’re off.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.900
In both the steady-learning and eureka-moment tasks, 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.900
the ‘haven't tried hard enough’ circle acts as 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.100
a simple algorithmic prompt 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.400
to determine whether further effort is needed. 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.400
If the task can't be done, more effort is required. 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.500
If it still can’t be done, still more effort is required. 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.100
And so on — until finally it can be done.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.900
But the ‘haven’t tried hard enough’ circle gets vicious in other scenarios. 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.200
Without binocular vision, no amount of effort will unlock stereograms. 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.900
Raw effort won’t help any of us when it comes to goals 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.500
like levitating, or hearing the rotation of Jupiter, or making a cloud smile. 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.600
Sometimes it isn’t that the goal’s impossible, 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.700
but that we become entrenched in an impossible method. 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.200
Take the alchemists’ dream of chrysopoeia — 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.200
the transmutation of other metals into gold. 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.500
In the 1980s, 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.200
minute quantities of gold were reportedly obtained from bismuth, 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.900
not through chemical reactions, which the alchemists doggedly pursued, 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.400
but by physical bombardment from a particle accelerator. 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.900
Before you put task failure down to lack of effort, 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.400
you have to rule out all other possible explanations — 

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.900
including lack of physical endowment and unworkable method, 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.900
but most basic of all, task impossibility. 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.500
So, first things first: 

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.700
let’s have it demonstrated that seeing gods is achievable — 

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.100
as it is with stereograms, playing music, and seeing colour. 

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.900
Then we can talk about who hasn’t tried hard enough.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.300
I have to believe in gods first, then I’ll see them? 

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.400
Wrong. I speak from experience. 

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.600
I used to believe without reservation. Never saw a god. 

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.400
What I did was take experiences that I found rewarding or punishing, 

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.900
or seemed improbable or inexplicable, 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.200
and attributed them with divine significance. 

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.400
That’s not seeing a god. That’s defining pixies — 

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.900
defining a supernatural agent as the cause of these experiences, 

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.900
then taking those experiences as evidence of that supernatural agent. 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.200
It’s a system perfectly designed to reinforce unjustified beliefs.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.400
Nothing makes sense without gods? 

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.700
On the contrary, history demonstrates 

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.400
that things make more sense without gods. 

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.900
I’ve already noted previous divine conceptualisations 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.900
of thunder, the sun, etc. 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.600
When we use gods as pseudo-explanations which offer no insight, 

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.600
we miss valid explanations which offer reliable, predictable results.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.400
Many christians claim we all secretly believe in their god Yahweh — 

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.300
that we’re just angry with him. 

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.700
This idea seems to track back to a Biblical passage in Romans, 

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.100
that claims Yahweh made known to the godless 

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.500
those aspects of himself that could be known. 

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.900
The obvious problem with trying to use this passage 

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.300
to suggest everyone secretly believes 

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.900
is that the Bible fully acknowledges the existence of unbelievers. 

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.900
Mark 16 talks of the condemnation awaiting those who don’t believe. 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.900
Corinthians 6 specifically instructs christians 

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.900
not to be yoked together with us, citing our wickedness and darkness.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.700
No mention here of pretending not to believe. 

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.100
These and other Biblical passages make an explicit distinction 

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.100
between those who believe and those who don’t.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.400
If it was true that everyone already believed, 

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.700
then missionaries would be redundant. 

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.700
The most their work could amount to would be simply 

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.900
to remind the cultures they visited of beliefs they already possessed. 

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.900
But that’s not what they do, is it. 

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.900
Missionary work isn’t restoration. It’s colonisation. 

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.300
And it’s further evidence that seeing gods is nothing like seeing colour.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.700
I gave an example of a formal experiment earlier, 

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.700
but the evidence of our colour perception is everywhere. 

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.500
We use it to negotiate traffic, to judge the ripeness of fruit, 

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.500
to interpret statistical charts, to identify poisonous species, 

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.500
to distinguish sports teams. And so on. 

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.000
But no such utility has been demonstrated regarding gods. 

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.700
On the contrary, the so-called evidence presented in defence of gods 

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.500
is a quagmire of contradiction, evasion, and deflection. 

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.300
Different issues are thrown up by the statement 

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.300
that arguing with atheists is like trying to convey 

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.700
the beauty of a rainbow to a colourblind person. 

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.100
For starters, colourblindness is a red herring. 

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.500
The obstacle here isn’t an inability to see colour. 

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.400
If you think it is, let me remove that obstacle 

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.500
by inviting you to convey the beauty of rainbows to me. 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.100
I don’t find rainbow beautiful at all — I find them insipid. 

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.900
But I do see colour perfectly well.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.400
Folks who accept my invitation soon realise the problem. 

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.100
They can talk about the colour of rainbows till the cows come home. 

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.200
They can talk about saturation, juxtaposition, permeation. 

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.300
Yep, I see all of that too. Rainbows still leave me cold. 

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.500
Beauty is not conveyed. 

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.400
When we say something’s beautiful — 

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.400
whether it’s an object, a sensation, an idea — 

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.500
we’re not perceiving some inherent property of that thing. 

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.400
All we’re saying is that we feel some personal connection with it; 

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.400
that it resonates with our own ideas, values, fantasies, needs. 

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.700
Nothing more than that. Nothing objective; nothing universal. 

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.900
We haven’t observed some profound reality, 

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.900
or unlocked some transcendental insight. 

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.700
Nor does beauty indicate goodness. 

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.900
There’s little that we humans haven’t found beautiful in our time — 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.900
including rape, torture, genocide, even apocalypse. 

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.900
The idea of these things puts some humans in a state of rapture. 

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.100
Experiences of beauty merely reflect our own sense of personal connection. 

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.500
And those connections can be broken. 

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.500
For instance, beauty might not survive 

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.900
the revelation of disagreeable information. 

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.400
If we discover that a favourite singer beats his spouse and children, 

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.900
we might well find that his music, 

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.700
which for years we’ve found transportingly beautiful, 

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.500
seems suddenly empty. The music hasn’t changed. 

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.100
It’s our connection with it that’s been damaged. 

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.200
When ex-christians are asked what prompted them 

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.300
to unsubscribe from christianity, a very specific experience emerges 

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.900
as one of the most common, pivotal factors. 

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.900
Reading the Bible. Some cite it as the cause of their deconversion — 

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the primary event that begins the unravelling. 

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.500
Sometimes it’s characterised more as a catalyst — 

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.900
reading the Bible lubricates a process already in motion. 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.900
For others, Biblical disillusionment comes 

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.900
near the end of their transition to atheism. 

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.700
For these folks, it has more of the feel 

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.700
of nailing a coffin already long-assembled.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.100
But all of these folks are responding to new disagreeable knowledge 

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.300
that damages their previous connection. 

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.300
For many of them, it’s the Biblical celebration of sadism 

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.200
that makes them realise just what they’ve been signed up to — 

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.200
seeing humans depicted as disposable playthings 

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.700
who must dance to whatever arbitrary, degrading tune 

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.400
Yahweh chooses to hum.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.500
And this is by no means an exclusively christian phenomenon. 

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.900
Some ex-muslims have expressed similar alienation 

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.400
in relation to the Qu’ran and the Hadith.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.800
Of course, losing a powerfully beautiful connection can be painful. 

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.100
And rather than face that pain, some will try to prevent the loss. 

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.500
One way to do this is to cherry-pick — 

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.900
like reframing a vile painting, the apologist reframes the Bible 

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.400
to try and hide the ugly parts from the audience. 

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.400
Forget about all that dehumanising sadism, 

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.900
just think about the fluffy stuff, like the story of the good Samaritan — 

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.300
a story that encourages us not to stand by 

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.300
in the midst of suffering and do nothing, 

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.100
but to do what we can to help. 

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.500
A principle the Biblical god Yahweh conspicuously fails to honour.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.500
Other apologists display their vile painting unapologetically, 

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.400
and instead try to paint their audience as similarly degraded. 

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.900
Rather than attempt to hide the Bible’s sadism, 

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.100
they assert that we’re all sinful creatures deserving death, 

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.500
so we should expect no better treatment. 

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.900
If you ever find yourself in a community 

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.900
that tries to instill that level of self-loathing in you, 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.300
I’d suggest you think hard about the company you’re keeping, 

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.500
and about whose needs are really being served by your degradation.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.400
Other apologists attempt to blur the vile painting, 

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.900
absolving Yahweh of his atrocities by suggesting 

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.900
he must have ultimately noble reasons, 

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.900
however unclear they appear to us. 

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.900
With substantial denial and distortion, 

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Biblical beauty can sometimes be preserved. 

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.000
But preserved at a cost. 

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.900
Those who, with honesty and integrity, refuse to conspire 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.600
with these distortions will have to be discounted in some way — 

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.000
mischaracterised, dehumanised, even demonised. 

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.500
The conflict this kind of distortion breeds is a price we all pay — 

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.900
and will continue to pay so long as we’re happy 

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.100
to value our personal fantasies above the lives of other humans.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.900
An experience of beauty can be uplifting, consoling, intoxicating. 

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.200
But it does not mean that the beholder of that beauty 

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.900
has special access to some transcendental reality hidden from others. 

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.200
In fact, in order to sustain that experience of beauty, 

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.900
substantial amounts of reality might have to be blocked out. 

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.200
As I’ve indicated, human beings can connect to many things. 

00:15:51.300 --> 00:16:00.900
The question is: do they have any substance?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.500
If you’re not familiar with the illusionist Derren Brown, 

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.400
I encourage you to change that. 

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.100
If you have 50 odd minutes to spare, 

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.500
I recommend the second part of his Fear and Faith project.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.100
In it, he explored our desire 

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.500
to make sense out of the randomness we experience. 

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.200
He invited applications to a fake TV show called ‘Intervention’. 

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.900
Meeting his chosen subject Emma, 

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.900
he explained that a number of actors would be 

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.400
intervening in her everyday life over the next few weeks 

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.900
in order to teach her lessons that she could use in a positive way. 

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.500
She was told all the encounters would be filmed to see her reactions. 

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.500
Her task was to detect these interventions, 

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.600
and record them in a video diary. 

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.200
In fact, there were no actors and no cameras. 

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.800
She was left to go about her business unobserved.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.900
Nonetheless, she recorded a number of events 

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.100
that she suspected to be artificially staged, 

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.400
like people staring at her, or running after her with money. 

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.700
And she started to consider the lessons they might be teaching her — 

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.700
for instance she began to think she should smile a bit more, and worry less. 

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.700
But the interventions and the lessons were all in her head. 

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.500
The parallels with theism are clear. 

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.500
Having been a theist myself, I recognise how we were encouraged 

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.400
to look out for divine interventions in our lives. 

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.500
And just like Emma, we of course identified many interventions, 

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.200
along with the lessons we thought they might be teaching us. 

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.400
What evidence did we ever have 

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.500
that they were in fact any divine interventions? None whatsoever.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.400
Of course we all learn from life. 

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.000
As an atheist, I still review my actions critically. 

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.400
I ask myself, Am I ok with the way I’ve behaved? 

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.600
Have I been fair? 

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.900
Might I have done things differently given the chance? 

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.500
I don’t think anyone who’s serious about self-awareness

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.900
ever stops asking questions like these. 

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.900
The only thing that stopped when I became an atheist 

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.900
was the head game I was playing on myself 

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.500
that there was some grand, supernatural design behind it all. &nbsp;

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.100
The Derren Brown special also showed 

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.900
an artificially induced religious conversion. 

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.200
Over a course of focussed conversation, 

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.100
Derren invited an atheist stem cell researcher called Natalie 

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.700
to imagine a perfect father, to imagine a sense of awe, 

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.900
to think about the idea of faith reframed as a positive thing, 

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.400
and to think about the notion of agency in her life — 

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.700
the idea that there could be a plan.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.700
Derren then left her to her thoughts, 

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.900
suggesting she should feel free 

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.200
to stand up and move around if she wanted. 

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.500
The moment she did so, she appeared to be physically overwhelmed 

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.100
by what she later described as love magnified beyond her experience. 

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.400
It’s clearly an indescribably beautiful moment for her. 

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.900
She begins to cry and offers both gratitude 

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.100
and apologies to an unidentified recipient.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.900
She reports the feeling that her spectrum has been broadened, 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.700
labelling the experience ‘supernatural’ because she was unable to explain it. 

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.400
Derren later debriefs her, 

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.700
gingerly explaining how her experience was stage-managed. 

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.400
It’s fascinating viewing. 

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.100
And, for many folks who’ve had similar experiences, 

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.200
possibly uncomfortable viewing. 

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.500
Because it does raise one loud and reverberating bell of a question: 

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.400
‘Is that what happened to me?’ 

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.900
Was your experience the product of an accumulation of suggestions 

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
simmering away then coming together 

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.500
in a powerful moment of beautiful but artificial revelation?

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.500
Some of us will choose to ignore these questions. 

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.500
Some will seek refuge in thought-terminating clichés 

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.900
like the colourblindness analogies. 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.400
How you respond is up to you. 

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.700
For me, if it’s a choice between a beautiful illusion and an ugly fact, 

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.200
gimme ugly every time — 

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.900
whether that means discovering the treachery of a loved one, 

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.900
the betrayal of a trusted government, 

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
or the depravity of a cherished religion. 

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.500
Only when we possess good information about the world 

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.500
can we hope to respond with any real justice and precision. 

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.900
Which is why I encourage you to stay with these questions; 

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.500
to see them through; to ask yourself:

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.000
‘Am I really seeing things?’
