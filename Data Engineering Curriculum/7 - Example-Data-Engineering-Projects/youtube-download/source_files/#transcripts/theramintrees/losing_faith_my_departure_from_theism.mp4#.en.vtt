00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.359
Atheism happened to me when I wasn't looking.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.519
Theism happened to me when I wasn't thinking.

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.039
I was an intensely rational boy.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.320
It was born from a natural ravenous
curiosity about the world.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.339
I love pulling things apart to see how
they worked. Not living things.

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.179
I wasn't one of those boys who terrorises insects.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.479
But inanimate objects were fair game,

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.979
and as a child my toys had a rough time of it.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.920
I also had a love of reasoning for its own sake

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.700
and could while away hours absorbed in logic problems

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.610
purely for the mental exercise.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.210
There was a period in my childhood

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.700
when I applied that curiosity and reasoning freely

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.180
to all areas of life.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.080
I wanted to understand everything.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.620
My incessant questions were greeted
by the adults in my life

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.240
with everything from amusement to exasperation.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.040
But there was one subject where my questions

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.880
met with a very different response.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.580
Not at first. At first, information was
gushingly forthcoming.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.980
When I walked into the strange building

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.520
for the first time and saw the giant man of wood

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.259
standing with arms outstretched like a
gymnast or a diver

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.799
I didn't even have to open my mouth
before a smiling stranger leaned in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.300
and told me the man's name

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.080
which to my young
ears sounded like 'cheeses'.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.160
At home, we had cheap little pint-sized
reproductions of statues

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.119
like the Discobolus of Myron,

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.819
the Venus de Milo and Rodin's The Kiss.

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.600
I'd never seen anything on the scale.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.060
To be told this cheeses was a real man,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.420
and to see how people revered him,
piqued my imagination.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.660
My young head was soon being filled
with stories about a god called Yahweh,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.020
who I realised was the invisible lord my
parents always spoke to before meal times.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.859
The stories came from an impossibly
dense book called the Bible

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.659
which looked to me as if it might take
a hundred years to read.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.380
But it seemed no time at all

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.620
before I was pulling this Bible apart too.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.120
In the book of Genesis

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.079
the first humans, Adam and Eve, 
were expelled from the paradise of Eden

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.320
for eating fruit from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.260
But if they didn't know good from bad
until after they ate the fruit

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.200
how could they be blamed for eating it?

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.809
Yahweh seemed to accept that they were
manipulated into eating it by the serpent

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.909
who told them it was okay — so why punish them?

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.909
The Adam and Eve story also said

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.420
they heard Yahweh walking
through the garden of Eden.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.610
But I'd been told Yahweh was everywhere.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.590
How could you walk and
be everywhere at the same time?

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.860
And why punish all of humanity
for Adam and Eve's actions?

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.130
You didn't jail the children of bank
robbers for their parents' crimes.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.230
There was the story of Lazarus who was
raised from the dead by cheeses.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.530
I'd been told you went to heaven when you died

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.060
so why did cheeses cry when Lazarus died?

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.240
Why wasn't he happy he was in heaven?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.900
And didn't raising him from the dead mean

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900
taking him out of heaven?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.380
That didn't seem very kind.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.610
At first answers were given, but these
just led to more problems

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.910
which I would then point out.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.370
Increasingly, I'd just be told there
were some things only Yahweh knew.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.390
This didn't stop my questions.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.220
But before long, the responses 
took on threatening overtones.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.090
I remember the cold stare from a relative when

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.780
at the age of around six I started 
pulling apart Noah and the Ark.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.220
In this story, Yahweh commanded 
Noah to build a huge ship

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.340
to house specimens of every land-dwelling
species, to prevent them all dying out

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.680
when a forthcoming flood engulfed the Earth.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.090
Only, while the Bible depicted the flood
as a deliberate act of genocide by Yahweh,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.270
cleansing the Earth of his flawed creation,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.690
we'd been told a more child-friendly version

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.579
in which Yahweh merely foresaw a
global flood and told Noah to warn everyone.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.100
Here, the flood was being presented as natural.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.640
I pointed out that rain was produced

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.860
when water evaporated from the land

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.680
which meant the more it rained, the more
water had disappeared from the land.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.450
So how could it ever build up to cover the Earth?

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.109
Where did it go afterwards?

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.229
And why did Noah even have to build an ark?

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.069
In Exodus 14:21

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.309
Yahweh divided the waters for Moses.

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:19.479
Why couldn't he have held them back here?

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.279
Wasn't he powerful enough?

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.540
I recall the low, menacing voice warning me: 
'Don't question God's word!'

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.120
The glare that immobilised me with its hostility.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.840
I didn't have the first clue what I'd done wrong.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.860
I just wanted to understand this unfathomable story.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.120
My questions had never received
this kind of response.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.220
But when it came to religion, that's how
it would be from now on.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.320
When I highlighted various practical problems
Jonah would've encountered

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.099
living inside a fish for three days

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.599
I got another furious scowl.

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.190
The message was clear:

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.090
questioning the Bible would no longer be tolerated.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.250
It was immensely frustrating.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.470
If I couldn't ask questions how could I learn?

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.500
But if the adults were acting this way

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.640
I must be doing something very bad.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.980
Over the weeks, it reached a point where I felt

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.680
absolutely stir-crazy, sitting in church

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.419
being fed more problems I was forbidden to investigate.

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.270
The prospect of coming to this place
every week for the rest of my life

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.070
filled me with a sense of doom.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.180
I said I didn't like church

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.040
and I didn't want to go anymore.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.719
My complaints were dismissed.

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.319
Faced with unbearable but inescapable situations,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.100
our brains sometimes flip those situations
into something more bearable — even positive.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.140
An example is Stockholm syndrome,
where hostages bond with their captors.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.040
I remember watching the adults listening
contentedly to the sermons,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.469
thinking how easy it must be when you didn't
concern yourself with the problems;

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.500
when you just accepted without question
— as they did.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.319
Before I knew it, I had stopped
swimming against the tide.

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.639
I succumbed to a rationalisation
offered in many sermons,

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.370
that unquestioning acceptance showed
spiritual maturity.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.020
Soon I was groaning when I heard other
children a church

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.180
asking their parents similar questions,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.470
thinking to myself how pesky I must have sounded.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.120
Religion had split itself off in my mind.

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.869
It was now an area bound by its own rules.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:13.469
Here, my natural skepticism had been
replaced by submission.

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.980
Here, contradictions were okay.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.360
It was enough simply to believe that
someone somewhere knew the answer.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.780
Here, faith had become a virtue.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.440
Even though my questions
were a thing of the past,

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.779
religiously inspired aggression from the
adults in my life was not.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.099
On one occasion, I'd been collected
from school one afternoon.

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:33.979
When  asked what I'd learned that day,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.040
I mentioned that the teacher
told us about speech disorders.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.400
In an innocent moment, I pondered out loud
whether cheeses might have had a stammer.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.860
In the next moment, my head was
slamming against a brick wall,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.940
the side of my face buzzing,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.680
and two words thundering into my ears:

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.380
'Don't blaspheme!"

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.120
Over the next few years, my private 
commitment to christianity grew.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.460
And when I changed to a new school
at the age of eleven

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.540
I joined a lunchtime christian group
called Christian Union.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.940
consisting of students,
teachers and invited speakers.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.320
While church was a
predominately passive experience,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.600
Here, we were encouraged to express ideas

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.040
and testify to the possible signs of Yahweh in our lives.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.440
My participation got off to a creaky start.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.220
But I soon got the hang of the rules

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.920
which were essentially the rules of comic improvisation.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.870
Rule number one: agree.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.460
When someone puts forward an idea, go with it.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.920
If someone started talking about
what Yahweh wanted

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.230
you shouldn't start disagreeing and
saying you thought he wanted something else.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.630
That was dropping the ball.
Dropping the ball destroyed the magic.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.230
Even if what was being suggested didn't inspire you,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.820
you needed to go with it and affirm it.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.700
Rule number two: add.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.140
Don't just agree.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.780
If disagreeing is dropping the ball,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.200
then merely saying 'Yeah' is blandly handing it back.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.980
The aim is to keep the ball moving.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.560
To do that, you had to offer your own observations.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.420
Say what you thought Yahweh wanted.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.700
Rule number three: assert.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.520
Don't ask questions. Make assertions.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.460
Asking questions means making problems
that other people have to solve.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.460
In the ball game analogy, this is like
switching the ball with a bowling bowl —

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.520
constantly weighing people down
and dragging momentum.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.620
Assertions generated more material
for folks to bounce off.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.670
Before long, I'd become quite
a vocal member of the group.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.210
I'd found a fellowship I could really relate to

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.500
and began to take unprecedented fulfilment in my faith.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.620
Even began to think about becoming a priest.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.340
A Nigerian pastor called Yemi
who'd spoken at Christian Union

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.240
struck up a personal connection with me,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.020
visiting me at home and corresponding
with me when he returned to Lagos,

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.160
telling me Yahweh had given him a vision of my future

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.069
in which he saw me doing great things
for christianity.

00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:42.149
I was high on religion.

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:43.789
But later that same year

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:48.369
a simple question from one of my teachers
would bring it all crashing down.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.040
In response to a turgid little essay
I'd written about my faith,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.759
a teacher called Mr Elliot

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:03.979
— a butcher's dog of a man, prone to safari jackets —

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.640
had written a comment asking me why I
believe what I believed.

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:10.289
The question seems straightforward enough at first.

00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:11.789
Nothing sprang to mind.

00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:13.589
But I'd think about it when I got home

00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:15.260
and then I'd have a lot to say.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.040
But when I got home,
I didn't have a lot to say.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.640
My brain churned up endless signs
of Yahweh's hand moving through my life.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.180
Coincidences I couldn't explain.
Physical sensations I couldn't explain.

00:09:27.189 --> 00:09:28.989
Lessons life had taught me.

00:09:28.989 --> 00:09:31.549
Stuff that would've gone down fine in Christian Union.

00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:34.180
But faced with a discerning
individual like Mr Elliot,

00:09:34.189 --> 00:09:36.320
I suddenly saw how flimsy it looked.

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:40.389
My inability to explain coincidences
and physical sensations

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:42.920
illustrated nothing but my own ignorance.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.320
And so what if I'd learned some
lessons from life experiences?

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:48.189
That merely meant I had a brain.

00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:50.329
I needed stronger material than this.

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:53.969
In the next Christian Union meeting,
I put the question to the group.

00:09:53.969 --> 00:09:56.940
I was sure I'd get some good answers
because some members had claimed

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.640
in very strong terms that Yahweh
had actually told them to do things.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.260
But when pressed, they now said they just meant

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.380
that they'd interpreted certain life experiences
as messages from Yahweh.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.760
I was bewildered.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.220
You'd never claim humans 'told' you
to do things when all you meant

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.760
was that you thought they might want you to do things.

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:18.829
There I'd been, hoping Yahweh would one day
speak to me like he had to them

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:22.720
when all the time they'd had no more
experience of him than me.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.100
I was disillusioned but not defeated.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.120
I had faith that someone somewhere had the answers.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.800
At church that Sunday

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.960
during tea and biscuits after the service

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.380
I put the question to some of the congregation.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.040
But it was the same story.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.000
One woman spoke about prayers healing the sick.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.580
I asked the question I suspected Mr Elliot would ask:

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.100
What about when the person we pray for dies?

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.230
She paused and said that it was just their time.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.710
I pointed out that if it was already determined

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.740
whether or not it was someone's time

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.260
that made prayer pointless.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.260
An awkward smile from her.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.320
And the beginnings of panic in me.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.500
My critical thinking was spilling
into my religious thinking.

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:05.489
And, like prayer and predestination, they didn't mix well.

00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:08.500
I tried to make the predestination argument work.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.300
Could it be argued the predestined
prayers worked because they were

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.580
predestined to be heard by Yahweh?

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.900
But this made a nonsense of Yahweh's omniscience.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.160
This demanded that he'd have to pretend to himself

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.260
that he had a different plan for people

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.790
knowing all along that he would then hear
a predestined prayer that would change his mind.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.650
When I got home, I set out to
answer Mr Elliot's question myself.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.310
After all, I should be able to give my own reasons.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.580
It was time to take a much closer look

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.000
at the religious dogma I'd been
so stridently defending.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.110
My assessment would be a brutally honest process.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.210
But I felt I could afford to be brutal.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.190
I was confident there'd be an abundance of support.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.000
So I threw myself into the arguments.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.040
It was like a huge house, with each idea
a room to be explored.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.340
I sped through some of the basic
fallacious justifications.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.490
Did it count for anything that so many
people shared my beliefs?

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.870
Or that among them were some of
history's geniuses?

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.470
Or that these beliefs had lasted for centuries?

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.590
No.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.380
Our former belief that the sun orbited the Earth

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.460
showed that everyone could be wrong, even geniuses,

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.380
and that a belief's longevity
was no guarantee of its validity

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.540
What about the fact that
these beliefs changed people's lives?

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.280
I'd recently met with a christian group
one evening to see a film called

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.820
The Cross and the Switchblade

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.620
which told the story of a New York pastor

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.530
turning teenage gang members away from crime

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.030
through his christian ministry.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.890
But this was no argument either.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.670
That beliefs could inspire changes in
people's lives was not evidence of their truth.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.510
— merely of their potential to inspire some people.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.830
Time after time, unexamined arguments like these

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.170
that had always had a vague, intuitive appeal

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.040
fell down the instant I examined them.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.780
In Mr Elliott's class, to my relief

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.300
he didn't pursue his question.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.920
But I continued to look for some solid answers.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.350
I didn't want to be put in this position again.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.620
Eventually, I turn to the Bible.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.130
I'd read much of it in my time

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.130
but never actually gone cover to cover.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.480
It was disquieting.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.440
Blatant contradictions leapt out at every level —

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.400
from the inexplicably petty to the indefensibly unjust.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.580
In Numbers 6:5, Yahweh instructed
men to grow their hair long.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.920
But 1 Corinthians 11:14 stated that long hair
on a man was intrinsically dishonourable.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.580
1 John asserted that there was
no place for fear in love.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.180
But in the book of Deuteronomy alone

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.260
Yahweh's desire to be feared
was underscored 14 times.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.960
In Psalms 51, Yahweh took no pleasure 
in sacrifice or burnt offerings

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.480
while a moment ago, in Genesis 8,
he'd seemed rather partial.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.060
The practice of punishing children for
their parents' sins was approved in Exodus 34,

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.820
seemingly disavowed three books
later in Deuteronomy 24,

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.220
only to be approved again four chapters
later in Deuteronomy 28.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.940
I already knew several Biblical episodes —
like the testing of Job and of Abraham —

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.880
where Yahweh permitted or 
instigated horrendous cruelty.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.690
And I'd long ago learned the sordid
Biblical version of Noah and the Ark.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.260
Previously, I'd blocked out a lot of the anxiety
these aroused by focusing on Jesus.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.700
But going through chapter by chapter 
Jesus was no longer enough

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.300
to eclipse the sheer scale a brutality.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.860
There was the tale of Onan

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.780
whose brother was killed by Yahweh

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.400
and who was then instructed to marry and
impregnate his brother's widow.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.190
When Onan declined, Yahweh killed him too.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.010
There was the tale of Elisha

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.450
who cursed a group of children
in the name of Yahweh

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.360
when they made fun of his baldness.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.660
Two bears then appeared from the woods

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.900
and tore up 42 the children

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.880
after which Elisha went happily on his way.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.080
A candidate for the
most nauseating slaughterfest

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:48.829
was the story of the Levite and the
concubine in Judges 19 to 21

00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:51.069
in which the rape and murder of a woman

00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:54.109
led directly to the deaths of over 40,000,

00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:57.869
as Yahweh repeatedly sent the tribes
of Israel into war against each other.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.750
The story ended with the subjugation of 400 virgins,

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.310
the only survivors a tribe wiped out

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.480
for declining to participate in the wars.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.570
My fellow Christians could produce no
convincing defenses.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.250
Some argued that it was a time barbarism back then

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.250
so Yahweh had to relate to humans in barbaric ways.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.899
That was ridiculous.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.060
Any god who had to pander
to the psychology of humans

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.740
had no moral sovereignty.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.120
Also Yahweh was perfectly
willing to harden people's hearts —

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.840
to deliberately make them more
disagreeable, destroying their free will.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.790
So couldn't he soften hearts too?

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.790
Make people more agreeable?

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.670
Isn't that what loving parents would do
if they have the power,

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.440
rather than send their children into war?

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.650
Throughout my reading and discussions

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.320
A new thought would occasionally
bubble up in my mind:

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.200
I could do a better job than Yahweh.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.100
Instinctively, I'd instantly dismiss
this blasphemous notion.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.040
It kept coming back.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.700
Larger and larger.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.440
With the Bible only generating new problems,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.140
I turned to a subject I'd tended to keep out of mind.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.000
It wasn't the reason I believed

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.910
but it was a reason to believe:

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.790
hell.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.290
Because if you didn't believe

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.790
that's where you were going —

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.250
To a place of everlasting torture.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.130
Instinctively, I recoiled at
the very thought of the fiery pit.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.400
But within seconds my fear of hell had
vanished forever.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.220
Within those seconds,
I realised the idea of hell was moronic

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.000
Dividing the entire human
population into just two groups

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.630
— one going to hell, the other going to heaven —

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.030
on the basis of what gods they believed in?

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.500
So all those who'd dedicated their lives
tirelessly to humanitarian pursuits

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.420
but had been raised to believe in
hindu gods deserved eternal torture?

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.700
That was plainly immoral.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.420
Any just system should judge everyone
fairly on their individual deeds.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.200
But that was incompatible with
a binary system like heaven and hell.

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.829
You couldn't divide people into either good or bad.

00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:53.680
Human morality was a spectrum,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.120
with folk stretching across every part it.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.440
I imagined everyone who'd ever existed

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.240
standing in a row from good to bad

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.580
with the person on the right marginally more good;

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.960
the person on the left fractionally more bad.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.120
How could you draw a dividing line —

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.020
a cut-off point between the two sides,

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.380
where one side went to hell, the other to heaven?

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.840
It was absurd.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.340
Wherever you drew the line

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.339
it would be between two people with
a virtually identical moral score.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.679
The difference between them might be a single deed.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.600
And yet one would be destined for eternal torture

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.509
and the other eternal paradise.

00:17:25.509 --> 00:17:27.969
the irony was that many of my fellow christians

00:17:27.969 --> 00:17:30.800
had spoken of hell has the ultimate justice

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.060
for those who escaped it in the earthly life.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.320
But hell was about the most pathetic
parody of justice imaginable.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.860
Yahweh should've been a moral genius.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.160
But the dichotomy of hell and heaven

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.000
displayed the black-and-white
thinking of an infant.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.580
After years spent averting my gaze
from its flickering menace,

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.670
I so hell for what it was:

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.520
a tiny idea casting a large shadow.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.700
Argument after argument, discussion
after discussion on subject after subject,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.720
The entire contents of my belief were falling apart.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.800
Finally, I went to the source.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.639
Asked Yahweh to show himself.

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:10.059
Not through cryptic signs open to interpretation,

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:13.639
but unambiguously — a direct communication

00:18:13.639 --> 00:18:18.579
that would validate my commitment over these years.

00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:20.550
Silence.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.070
I was alone in a house full of contradictions.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.930
So it was that I turned my attention to the concept

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.680
that had allowed all these contradictions to accumulate;

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.050
the concept that had anaesthetised
my enquiring mind:

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.040
'Faith is a virtue'.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.860
This assertion had come to feel
so monolithic and indisputable.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.300
But now the simple truth was revealed:

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.840
No it isn't.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.380
The concept of faith tried to arouse and exploit

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.700
the kind of protective loyalty

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.460
we might feel towards loved ones.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.320
in whose goodness we trusted.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.760
But I realised that the trust we invest in loved ones

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.420
was based on very different principles.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.440
Trust in humans was earned.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.100
We believed in the goodness of loved ones because
we had direct experience of their goodness.

00:19:06.109 --> 00:19:09.309
Religious faith was not earned — it was
simply demanded

00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:13.169
based on a stack of bold claims
that were never substantiated.

00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:16.749
In fact, bizarrely, if direct evidence
was ever offered,

00:19:16.749 --> 00:19:19.040
faith would become instantly redundant.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.600
Faith, by its very nature, was forced

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.039
to reside in the ambiguous, the circumstantial

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:27.299
relying purely on the believers' conviction

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.580
that their inferences were correct.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.520
Faith differed from trust in another key respect:

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.360
if a loved one was accused of a trangression

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.340
that contradicted our good opinion

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.880
we'd want to see evidence

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.540
— in fact, we would demand it.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.220
but with religious faith

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.460
all contradictory evidence was dismissed as invalid

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.680
right from the start

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.340
on the assumption that if you took the time

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.740
to investigate it properly

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.240
it would turn out to be false.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.140
It was as I contemplated this last point further

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.460
that I experienced one of the creepiest moments

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.940
in my exploration —

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.380
when I realised that what I was looking at here

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.580
was the perfect system for protecting lies.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.360
Faith required that you believe

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.000
despite an absence of expected evidence

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.820
or despite the presence of conflicting evidence.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.610
But how do we detect lies?

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.080
Through the absence of expected evidence

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.030
or the presence of conflicting evidence.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.340
The very things that faith demanded we disregard.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.660
Any supreme intelligence would know

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.340
that a system that protected lies so efficiently

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.800
Would lay humans open

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.139
to just about any conceivable abuse.

00:20:27.139 --> 00:20:28.859
People could be manipulated to accept

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.580
all kinds of deceptions.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.560
those who complained about inconsistencies

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.520
could be silenced by the devastating accusation

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.660
that their faith wasn't strong enough.

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:41.789
No supreme intelligence would entertain
such a perverse concept as faith

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:46.289
unless that intelligence was itself perverse.

00:20:46.289 --> 00:20:51.049
it was disorientating when I emerged
from my period of reflection ....

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:53.689
into an entirely different space.

00:20:53.689 --> 00:20:55.040
It seemed ....

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.550
incomprehensible ....

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.060
but I no longer believed in a god.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.000
Everyone believed in a god.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.740
If not Yahweh, then Allah, or Vishnu —&nbsp;or someone.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.930
I genuinely thought I must be the only
person on the planet who didn't.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.210
The first person in history.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.590
That's how cloistered I'd been
in my cocoon of christianity.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.920
But I became aware that I
wasn't alone in this new space.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.200
My brother had also found his own path here.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.880
I was glad of the company.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.800
We took no immediate action.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.060
We played along.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.980
Went to church. Took communion.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.160
Life had been stripped of all context,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.580
all reference points.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.620
We took time to collect our thoughts

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.660
and consider our next move.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.270
The more I thought about it

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.250
the more impossible it seemed that we
were the only ones who'd made it here.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.630
We were only just entering our teens.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.050
It simply wasn't plausible to me

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.210
that folks in their 20s, 40s, 60s, 80s

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.040
had never found this place too.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.720
I began to theorise that maybe
religion was a giant hoax

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.260
perpetrated on children.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.020
A test of reasoning; a rite of passage.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.370
There had been obvious precedents.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.620
Father Christmas. The Tooth Fairy.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.440
I constructed a whole
elaborate model in my head

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.910
where deceits like Mr Claus and Ms Tooth

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.200
were set up as the early practice runs

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.630
and the adults were just waiting for us

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.600
to see through religion too.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.620
At the same time

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.420
they seemed to take it so seriously.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.740
I remembered the anger at my questions.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.120
The slap the sent me into the wall.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.420
But then I reasoned that if this was the
big test, maybe they had to play for real

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.420
right up until I told them straight out

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.590
that I didn't believe.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.950
I also figured that once we'd passed the test

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.900
we could all stop these pointless visits to church.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.620
So, one Sunday morning

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.160
we announced we didn't believe in god.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.650
Wailing. Threats. Fury.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.070
I felt suddenly sick. It wasn't a test.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.630
Within minutes we were given an ultimatum:

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.660
go to church or suffer punishment.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.870
We chose punishment.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.380
All kinds of prohibitions,
confiscations and gratuitous labours

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.280
were proposed if we didn't comply.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.460
We accepted them.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.700
When the fear strategy failed, it was put to us

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.840
that we'd made a lifetime
commitment to Yahweh.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.940
We said that it was an invalid 
commitment, made in ignorance.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.040
When the obligation strategy failed,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.580
We were subjected to the most
intense pleading for our return.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.610
But there was no way back,
even if we'd wanted one.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.370
The magic trick, once explained, can no longer deceive.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.170
When the guilt strategy failed

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.750
the frail, helpless act was swiftly dropped

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:37.060
replaced by sneering contempt, name-calling and aping.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.880
It was behaviour you'd expect to see in a playground.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.530
In my innocent idealism

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.880
I imagined that once the theatrics tied down

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.560
all I'd need to do was explain my thought process

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.310
and my position would be clear.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.110
So, when eventually my parents
demanded to know my reasons

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.920
I was more than happy to oblige.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.260
But when I started to talk,
I found I was constantly blocked

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.820
I'd be spoken over;

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.710
my sentences would be finished in outlandish ways;

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.000
and the conversation would be derailed by insults.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.030
Each time, we'd grind into silence.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.590
Later, they'd start the whole routine again.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.810
It was such conflicted behaviour.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.410
They seemed simultaneously determined
to hear the answer and not hear it.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.530
I didn't know about the concept of
cognitive dissonance back then

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:23.540
But what I was seeing reminded me of
Robbie the Robot from the film 'Forbidden Planet'

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.210
who blew his fuses when pressed to kill a human

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.380
— a command which contradicted his programming.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.240
I perceived a similar conflict here.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.800
If our reasons for rejecting religion were valid

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.180
that would contradict their religious programming.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.360
That contradiction had to be resolved.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.030
And it was being resolved by attacking us.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.210
In this conflicted state, like a hall of mirrors

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.520
our parents were incapable of honest reflection.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.940
We were characterised as

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.380
dishonest, arrogant, rebellious, naive —

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.420
whatever distortions would, in their minds, 
discount the possibility that we might have a point.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.600
Although I despised the behaviour I was witnessing

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.190
two thoughts kept a glimmer of empathy
from spluttering out completely.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.290
First, they'd been subjected to religious
indoctrination, just like I had

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.640
and, compared with me,
they'd sacrificed many more years.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.600
Second, just as I'd had my crisis

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.260
they were now having theirs.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.760
While I'd contained mine within myself

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.220
I was seeing their inner conflict nakedly expressed.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.660
But, empathy notwithstanding,
we were getting nowhere.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.250
And eventually I refused to continue.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.470
I made it clear that if they wanted a proper discussion

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.720
I'd be waiting.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.300
But I would no longer dignify any abuse.

00:25:33.309 --> 00:25:36.900
The christian teachers at school
attempted to exert their own pressure

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.020
expressing deep disappointment in me.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.160
Again, no curiosity was shown.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.760
They did ask me questions.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.200
But they were closed, rhetorical
questions like: was I angry with god?

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.670
Questions that show they weren't really listening.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.160
They were just attempting to rationalise my unbelief

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.640
into a form from which they
could distance themselves.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.180
When eventually they ran out of rationalisations

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.810
they distanced themselves from me.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.570
Animosities at home gradually died down.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.630
The ground was scorched

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.500
but, millimetre by millimetre,

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.770
the bare bones of respect
and trust began to regrow.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.770
My offer of a proper discussion wasn't taken up

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.110
and religion became a closed subject.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.810
There were occasional lapses.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.060
For many years, my brother and I
patiently rebuffed expressions of hope

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.100
That one day we would come back to religion.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.920
There was even the old random grenade
thrown in at mealtimes.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.920
Like 'Darwin recanted!'

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.840
In response, we would calmly decommission

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.060
these kinds of incendiary remarks

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.630
by introducing the facts and the meal would continue.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.320
Decades after we came out

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.960
I was to hear some very unexpected
sentiments expressed.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.610
Expressions of regret for the way
me and my brother were treated.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.770
Expressions of pride for the integrity
we'd shown over the years,

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.850
and for the people we'd grown up to be.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.200
Touching as those sentiments might seem

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.900
all they aroused in me was a great sadness.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.960
because they underscored the utter pointlessness

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.400
of all the conflict and estrangement we'd gone through.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.429
They underscored the love and closeness
that we'd all missed out on.

00:27:05.429 --> 00:27:08.209
All because unbelievers were damned

00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:10.849
in a book of higgledy-piggledy myths

00:27:10.849 --> 00:27:14.260
constructed in a time of inconceivable ignorance

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.480
but coercively inculcated
into generation after generation

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.300
as the indisputable truth.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.360
What a waste.

00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:36.779
I was an intensely rational boy.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.020
It was born from a natural
ravenous curiosity about the world.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.040
I loved pulling things apart to see how they worked.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.000
And then I was pulled apart.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.840
My rationality trampled.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.840
My curiosity smothered into a coma.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.240
My whole life knocked off course

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.680
by a blood-soaked old book.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.460
Theism happened to me when I wasn't thinking;

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.180
when I was systematically punished for thinking

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.380
until I surrendered and let others think for me.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.040
Atheism happened to me when I wasn't looking;

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.040
when I started exercising critical thought again

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.720
to pursue a path that I was convinced
would justify my faith.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.180
I sometimes refer to it as 
my Wile E. Coyote moment

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:17.710
— looking down and discovering

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.140
the ground I so confidently ran across

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.080
was no more than a cloud;

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.280
realising too late what a profound mistake it was

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.340
simply to take it on faith

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.940
that someone somewhere had the answers.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.780
Faith is not a virtue.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.400
Far from reflecting supreme intelligence

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.220
the concept to faith reeks

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.100
of a very human phenomenon.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.360
Fraud.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.000
As Oppenheimer noted, in order to detect errors

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.120
We need to be free to enquire.

00:28:44.129 --> 00:28:46.489
Faith stifles that free enquiry

00:28:46.489 --> 00:28:50.659
by protecting lies and silencing those
who threaten to expose them.

00:28:50.659 --> 00:28:53.299
To the curious, an encouragement:

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.640
continue to enquire.
