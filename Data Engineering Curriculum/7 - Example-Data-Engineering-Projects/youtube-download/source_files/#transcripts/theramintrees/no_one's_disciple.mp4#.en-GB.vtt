00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.949
In his essay On Liberty

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.140
philosopher John Stuart Mill discussed the
importance of individuality.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.609
Mill saw the free development of individuality

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.719
as one of the essential elements of human
well-being.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.170
When we passively allow the world to run our
life

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.840
we’re reduced to mindless machines.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.660
Our human capacities are withered and starved.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.690
By not following our own natures

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.697
we’re left with no nature to follow.

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:04.680
In contrast, when we run our own life

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.720
we exercise and develop all our faculties

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.690
including our reason, our judgement, our self-control.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.018
For Mill, individuality brings human beings

00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:16.812
nearer to the best thing they can be.

00:01:16.812 --> 00:01:19.819
He pointed out that no one’s idea of excellence

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.415
was to merely copy each other

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:25.280
and that the original insights that spring
from individuality

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.027
are a key driver in human innovation.

00:01:29.027 --> 00:01:32.172
Mill said it was absurd to live as if nothing
had been learned

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:34.420
about the world before we came into it.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.170
But we should feel free to critically assess

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.130
the traditions and customs we’re born into.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.310
We’re not obliged to follow empty or outdated conventions

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.270
that have failed to anticipate our modern insights.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.602
It’s no justification to continue practices

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:53.351
on the grounds they’ve always been done.

00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:57.270
Justification requires evidence of ongoing
relevance.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.539
For these and other reasons, Mill recognised

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.791
there was always a need for people to discover
new truths

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:08.102
and to inform us when old truths no longer hold.

00:02:08.102 --> 00:02:12.224
And that need rested on the preservation of
individuality.

00:02:12.224 --> 00:02:17.276
For Mill, whatever suppressed individuality
qualified as tyranny

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:19.331
whether it was done in the service of humans

00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:22.900
or supposed supernatural entities.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.806
Tyranny’s often conceptualised as the unconcealed exercise

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:31.773
of cruel, unreasonable and arbitrary power
and control.

00:02:31.773 --> 00:02:36.086
We picture tyrants openly using menace and
intimidation

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:38.615
to pull us into orbit around them

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:41.859
coercing us to submit to their ideas.

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.682
But the people who subjugate us aren’t always
openly abusive.

00:02:46.682 --> 00:02:52.308
Some inspire our genuine loyalty. Even love.

00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:57.604
Some come in the guise of a hero, a champion,
a saviour;

00:02:57.604 --> 00:03:03.670
someone who’ll rescue us, heal us,
enlighten us, affirm us.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.687
We welcome them openly, unaware we’re taking
in a Trojan Horse.

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:13.290
As with the tyrant, we fall into orbit around
them

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.563
submitting to their ideas.

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:20.223
As with the tyrant, this subjugation does
all the same harm

00:03:20.223 --> 00:03:22.321
suppressing our individuality;

00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:24.157
stunting our development;

00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:26.209
stifling our human capacities —

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.451
our reason, our judgement, our self-control;

00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:32.235
and on the wider level

00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:36.047
sabotaging human innovation and progress.

00:03:36.047 --> 00:03:39.810
It’s this capacity to inspire wholehearted
allegiance

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.040
that makes subjugation by heroes the most
complex to tackle.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.335
Believing them to be truly good

00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:51.319
we become their dedicated defenders, their
devotees, their disciples.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.662
We’re led by them. Moulded by them.

00:03:54.662 --> 00:03:57.825
Often keen to draw others into subjugation
with us.

00:03:57.825 --> 00:04:02.420
And suspicious and hostile towards individuals
who decline.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.257
Obviously, to suggest all heroes are intrinsically
harmful would be asinine.

00:04:08.257 --> 00:04:13.371
In his book ‘The Lucifer effect: understanding
how good people turn evil’

00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:17.301
psychologist Philip Zimbardo gives a range
of examples

00:04:17.301 --> 00:04:19.740
of genuinely helpful heroes

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.863
from whistle-blowers
to shelterers of persecuted groups;

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:27.877
from individuals ‘who organise their lives
around a humanitarian cause’

00:04:27.877 --> 00:04:30.000
to the everyday heroes of the moment

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.468
who act decisively when called to service.

00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:38.422
Clearly heroes exist across a spectrum from
helpful to harmful.

00:04:38.422 --> 00:04:40.873
And the nature of the hero is a big factor

00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:43.830
in whether we’ll find ourselves subjugated.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.962
But arguably the biggest determinant

00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:49.611
is the way we ourselves conceptualise heroes.

00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:53.852
When we view heroes realistically as fallible
human beings

00:04:53.852 --> 00:04:57.510
with accessible qualities, ideas and skills

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.163
we can appreciate them and learn from them

00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:02.627
without diminishing ourselves.

00:05:02.627 --> 00:05:05.750
So long as we maintain that practical perspective

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.510
any malignant heroes looking for a submissive
disciple to dominate

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.888
will be disappointed.

00:05:11.888 --> 00:05:15.387
The problem starts when we view heroes as
something bigger;

00:05:15.387 --> 00:05:17.212
when we elevate them above us

00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:21.637
as something superior, infallible, magical;

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:23.310
when we idealise them

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.922
as something abstract, symbolic, pseudo-parental.

00:05:27.922 --> 00:05:30.178
Then we turn them into fantasies

00:05:30.178 --> 00:05:32.994
no longer subject to rational appraisal.

00:05:32.994 --> 00:05:36.314
We imbue their ideas with false authority.

00:05:36.314 --> 00:05:39.346
We imbue their actions with fake righteousness.

00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:42.380
And they gain a new disciple.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.960
We’re especially susceptible to magical
hero fantasies when we feel powerless.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.510
When we experience tyranny, we might dream
of a champion

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.676
swooping in and rescuing us, propelled by
pure altruism.

00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:59.599
If individuals turn up who seem to fit that
description

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.599
we’re not always quick to question

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.051
what we might be surrendering by accepting
their services.

00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:07.779
With our guards lowered

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:13.070
we fail to notice we’re just swapping one
kind of subjugation for another.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.809
We can see suppressive hero relationships

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:21.748
in religion, politics, business, therapy,
the family.

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:27.487
I want to explore some of the Faustian bargains
we misguidedly enter into.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.256
In their paper ‘Changing the world and changing
the self’

00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:43.500
Rothbaum and colleagues noted that submission

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.628
to powerful leaders, groups or gods

00:06:46.628 --> 00:06:49.450
allows us to feel we’re joining in their power.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.369
In particular, they cite the vicarious control

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:54.590
evident in religious phenomena.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.550
For example, when we speak of gaining strength
through a god.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.901
Of course, vicarious power is only reflected
power.

00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.470
The moon has no light of its own.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.004
It just reflects the sun’s light.

00:07:08.004 --> 00:07:11.496
Without the sun, the moon would disappear.

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:14.212
Basking passively in the light of others

00:07:14.212 --> 00:07:16.990
is not a means of acquiring our own.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.303
But some folks who bask in the light of magical
heroes

00:07:20.303 --> 00:07:22.658
come to mistake it for their own.

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:25.820
In Alexander Pope’s An essay on criticism

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.808
he cautions us not to succumb

00:07:27.808 --> 00:07:31.049
to an inflated sense of our own abilities:

00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:33.837
A little learning is a dangerous thing

00:07:33.837 --> 00:07:37.630
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.616
—&nbsp;a metaphorical source of knowledge —

00:07:40.616 --> 00:07:43.733
There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain

00:07:43.733 --> 00:07:47.317
And drinking largely sobers us again.

00:07:47.317 --> 00:07:50.306
If we plot people’s confidence against their
knowledge

00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:52.438
we sometimes find a premature peak

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:55.854
of inflated self-assurance right at the start.

00:07:55.854 --> 00:08:00.732
Having gained a little learning, we overestimate
our proficiency.

00:08:00.732 --> 00:08:04.113
When we submit uncritically to magical heroes

00:08:04.113 --> 00:08:07.455
especially supposedly infallible divine ones

00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:11.750
our conviction can swell to absolute certainty.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.543
Our magical hero becomes our standard of truth.

00:08:15.543 --> 00:08:19.137
Every truth that contradicts our hero
becomes a lie.

00:08:19.137 --> 00:08:23.361
We show unshakeable faith
in what our heroes tell us.

00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:26.189
And little understanding of it.

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:28.649
Magical heroes can keep us stuck

00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:32.563
at the height of cocky ignorance for decades.

00:08:32.563 --> 00:08:35.840
Many of us who fall into misguided discipleship
around them

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.700
go to our graves installed on that summit.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.748
For those of us who do start to realise there’s
something wrong

00:08:42.748 --> 00:08:47.391
we face a humbling nosedive into doubt and
despair.

00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:50.209
This nosedive will be familiar to many folks

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:53.500
who’ve managed to let go of magical heroes.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.600
I experienced it myself in my teens

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.830
when having been indoctrinated into Christianity

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.484
I realised I was no longer persuaded by its claims.

00:09:03.484 --> 00:09:06.420
Having lived high in the clouds for years

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.370
one day I set out to find sound honest justifications
for my discipleship.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.019
 Reasons that could withstand any scrutiny.

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:20.515
Instead I discovered I was in a giant emotional
protection racket.

00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:23.202
Many magical heroes run rackets

00:09:23.202 --> 00:09:26.709
promising to protect individuals from some
harm.

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:31.072
This protection often turns out to be non-existent.

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:33.635
The magical heroes of Christian scripture

00:09:33.635 --> 00:09:36.793
— a god character and a man claimed to be
his son —

00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:40.248
were said to offer two kinds of protection.

00:09:40.248 --> 00:09:43.970
One was protection from a realm of eternal torture.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.957
A realm beyond death that couldn’t be verified.

00:09:48.957 --> 00:09:52.630
The other protection was from hazards in this
earthly life

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.298
— disease, disaster, destitution.

00:09:56.298 --> 00:09:58.596
To get this second type of protection

00:09:58.596 --> 00:10:03.311
disciples had to plead for help from the magical
heroes by praying.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:07.500
This second type would conceivably be open
to verification

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.321
except for the fact the outcome was completely
down to chance.

00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:16.661
Disciples were told their prayers might or
might not be accepted.

00:10:16.661 --> 00:10:20.480
We might or might not escape our abusive partner.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.932
Our child might or might not die of cancer.

00:10:24.932 --> 00:10:28.660
Comedian George Carlin famously said he stopped
praying to God

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.314
and started praying to the actor Joe Pesci.

00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:33.628
And he noticed the prayers he offered God

00:10:33.628 --> 00:10:35.476
and the ones offered Joe Pesci

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:39.721
were answered at about the same 50% rate.

00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:41.765
Chance divine intervention

00:10:41.765 --> 00:10:45.804
is indistinguishable from actual chance.

00:10:45.804 --> 00:10:48.039
An unverifiable realm of torture

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:52.057
is indistinguishable from a scary story.

00:10:52.057 --> 00:10:53.990
And a protection racket that fails

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.140
to demonstrate any protective function

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:01.514
is indistinguishable from a pure extortion
racket.

00:11:01.514 --> 00:11:03.228
When our magical heroes

00:11:03.228 --> 00:11:06.375
become the defining standard of truth and
morality

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:09.258
all kinds of concepts get corrupted.

00:11:09.258 --> 00:11:13.120
Superficially, some of these corruptions might
seem positive.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.234
But the effects are corrosive.

00:11:16.234 --> 00:11:18.413
My former magical Christian heroes

00:11:18.413 --> 00:11:20.551
were said to have executive power

00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:24.980
to forgive all our transgressions against everyone.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.127
But forgiveness has to come
from the people we hurt.

00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:32.176
No one else can forgive us in their place.

00:11:32.176 --> 00:11:36.290
A mother might forgive her son’s killer
for her own pain and loss.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:41.083
But she can’t offer vicarious forgiveness
on her son’s behalf.

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:44.152
The idea of divine vicarious forgiveness

00:11:44.152 --> 00:11:46.697
destroys the concepts of moral agency

00:11:46.697 --> 00:11:50.572
and responsibility on which forgiveness rests.

00:11:50.572 --> 00:11:54.628
It means we’re no longer answerable to the
people we wrong.

00:11:54.628 --> 00:11:59.794
Their grievances with us can be erased by
a third party.

00:11:59.794 --> 00:12:02.120
And the corruption goes deeper.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.170
To receive this worthless vicarious forgiveness

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.989
we’re told we have to forgive others.

00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:10.649
We have to forget about any apologies.

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:15.297
If we don’t forgive them, our magical heroes
won’t forgive us.

00:12:15.297 --> 00:12:17.765
In this atmosphere of unearned forgiveness

00:12:17.765 --> 00:12:22.029
many disciples predictably learn to take it
for granted.

00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:26.789
In 2017, Amber DeBono and colleagues
saw this reflected

00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:29.790
in three experiments where participants were led

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.944
to believe they were unsupervised.

00:12:31.944 --> 00:12:34.639
Christians who were instructed to read and
write

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:37.519
about a forgiving god stole more money

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.406
and cheated more on a math test

00:12:39.406 --> 00:12:41.230
than Christians who read and wrote

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.918
about a punishing god, a forgiving human

00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:47.339
a punishing human or a neutral story.

00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:49.459
DeBono and colleagues remarked:

00:12:49.459 --> 00:12:51.160
‘It seems that feeling that God

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.430
has forgiven our own trespasses

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.309
may merely leave us feeling free
to trespass again.’

00:12:57.309 --> 00:13:00.000
Obviously, to suggest all Christians

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.687
would steal or cheat like that is absurd.

00:13:02.687 --> 00:13:05.249
Honest Christians wouldn’t dream of it.

00:13:05.249 --> 00:13:08.290
But this finding will resonate with many Christians

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.507
and ex-Christians who’ve been repeatedly
mistreated

00:13:11.507 --> 00:13:16.248
by fellow disciples who never apologise or
mend their ways.

00:13:16.248 --> 00:13:20.152
Because every week at church there’s an
enforced amnesty

00:13:20.152 --> 00:13:23.312
where everyone has to forgive everyone else.

00:13:23.312 --> 00:13:26.089
Or suffer the consequences.

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:29.800
Automatic forgiveness is not the loving concept

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.196
it might seem on first glance.

00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:35.881
It stunts our moral and social development.

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:39.709
For abusive disciples, it removes the incentive

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:44.890
to reflect on their behaviour, to take responsibility
and do better.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.286
For targeted disciples, It breeds resentment

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.839
which they’re expected to just go on swallowing

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:52.628
to bursting point.

00:13:52.628 --> 00:13:55.850
Forgiveness gained by proxy or inducement

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.278
is worthless emotional snake oil.

00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:02.802
When we use these magical divine heroes as
role models

00:14:02.802 --> 00:14:06.022
taking everything they say and do to be correct

00:14:06.022 --> 00:14:08.591
we reproduce their chaos —

00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:11.301
their virtues, their flaws

00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:14.195
their wisdom, their stupidity

00:14:14.195 --> 00:14:17.761
their charity, their abuse.

00:14:17.761 --> 00:14:20.000
We mimic the good and the bad

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.819
without comprehending the difference.

00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:25.519
We can also find ourselves mimicking behaviour

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.589
that has no moral component.

00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:31.160
Within the mystical branch of Islam known
as Sufism

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.800
there’s a story of a disciple called Bayazid
Bustami

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.809
who refused to eat watermelon

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:39.138
because he didn’t know how Islam’s author

00:14:39.138 --> 00:14:40.959
the magical hero Muhammad

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.569
cut and ate watermelons

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:45.451
and he didn’t want to do it the wrong way.

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:48.589
There are similar stories in Islam of a disciple

00:14:48.589 --> 00:14:52.768
who would do a 360-degree turn on his camel
after mounting it

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:55.259
and a disciple who would kiss stones

00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:57.569
for no other reason than that they’d observed

00:14:57.569 --> 00:14:59.601
their magical hero doing it.

00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:05.337
Replicating arbitrary gestures is the foundation
of superstition.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:08.851
As humankind proceeds into uncharted areas

00:15:08.851 --> 00:15:12.009
the gulf between our long-dead magical heroes

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:15.290
and our modern lives becomes ever wider.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.829
Advancements in technology and medicine

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:22.197
— from in vitro fertilisation to interplanetary
colonisation —

00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:25.009
raise new kinds of moral questions

00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:27.670
for which our magical heroes’ dusty old
scriptures

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.010
offer no explicit guidance.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.850
Would colonising other planets be a crime

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.329
in the eyes of an Abrahamic god character?

00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:39.269
Maybe taking what was meant for other life
forms?

00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:43.690
Without scriptural direction, we’re left
with limited options.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.273
We could approach these issues like Bustami’s
watermelon

00:15:47.273 --> 00:15:51.535
and refuse to participate in any unmentioned
activity.

00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:56.810
Or we could try to find scriptural approximations
and make guesses.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.350
The Governing Body of the Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.949
forbid blood transfusions based on Biblical
passages

00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:04.829
that forbid the eating of blood

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:07.873
which has nothing to do with transfusions.

00:16:07.873 --> 00:16:11.519
Or we can take the ‘try it and see what
happens’ approach

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:14.085
employed by the same JW Governing Body

00:16:14.085 --> 00:16:17.607
in regard to genetically modified food.

00:16:17.607 --> 00:16:21.638
In an April 2000 article in its magazine ‘Awake!’

00:16:21.638 --> 00:16:25.910
it couldn’t decide whether or not this biotechnology

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.879
was equivalent to playing god.

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:31.929
The article concluded that if it was playing
god

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:36.889
the magical divine hero could step in and
reverse this development.

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:39.410
But what if he doesn’t step in?

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.922
Does that mean he approves?

00:16:41.922 --> 00:16:45.009
Or what if he’s just silently observing

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:47.449
and condemning everyone associated

00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:52.364
with genetically modified food for daring
to play god?

00:16:52.364 --> 00:16:55.350
These immobilising questions bring home

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.008
the central plight of the disciple:

00:16:58.008 --> 00:17:01.379
We can’t move past our magical heroes.

00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:04.850
We’re confined by their limitations.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:08.142
In order to move forward, we have to dethrone
them

00:17:08.142 --> 00:17:10.787
and their bogus literature.

00:17:10.787 --> 00:17:14.050
Pluck any novel from a shelf and odds are

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.212
we’ll find some wisdom,&nbsp;some insight.

00:17:17.212 --> 00:17:20.319
Even cookery books often digress from recipes

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:24.764
into some half-baked personal philosophy from
the author.

00:17:24.764 --> 00:17:27.020
It would actually be hard to write a book

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.649
totally devoid of merit even if we consciously
tried.

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:33.376
But just because a book’s got some good
ideas

00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:38.338
we don’t abandon all judgement and slavishly
follow every word.

00:17:38.338 --> 00:17:41.057
Even when books are marketed as a guide to
life

00:17:41.057 --> 00:17:45.701
we still decide what parts we find useful.
If any.

00:17:45.701 --> 00:17:50.136
Not so when we assign magical status to the
author.

00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:53.236
Part of life development is about separating
things

00:17:53.236 --> 00:17:55.896
we’ve mistakenly blurred together.

00:17:55.896 --> 00:17:58.345
Like nudity and sex.

00:17:58.345 --> 00:18:01.865
Blood-relatedness and a sense of obligation.

00:18:01.865 --> 00:18:06.461
Often, we blur ideas and people.

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.654
We need to separate them.

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:11.218
Good ideas can come from any source.

00:18:11.218 --> 00:18:14.870
Even tyrants occasionally express worthwhile
thoughts

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.160
I often start my videos with a quote.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.800
Over the years people have criticised some
of their authors

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.750
citing some past transgression, minor or major.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.790
They’ve criticised me for appealing to dubious
authorities.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.110
But I’m not appealing to authority.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.480
The quotes are about the idea, not the author.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.150
The author is incidental.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.423
Often many people will’ve converged on the
same thought.

00:18:41.423 --> 00:18:45.210
Sometimes I’ll have significant disagreements
with the author.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.208
The source doesn’t validate or negate the
idea.

00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:53.390
The idea stands&nbsp;or falls&nbsp;on its own terms.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.870
If authors have failed to uphold their own
stated values

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.606
we get an entertaining smack of irony.

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:04.184
Letting go of our magical heroes, divine or
otherwise

00:19:04.184 --> 00:19:07.810
is often just about separating ideas from
people.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.450
Amazing how the world changes

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.174
when that simple surgical act is performed.

00:19:14.174 --> 00:19:17.490
Descending from the certainty of divine discipleship

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.380
can feel like crashing after long-term dependence
on a euphoric drug

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.824
one that’s often been injected into us from
infancy.

00:19:25.824 --> 00:19:27.590
In the throes of cold turkey

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.448
we’re not always ready to see the upside

00:19:30.448 --> 00:19:32.934
which is that moving past the magical hero

00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:36.003
clears the path to knowledge.

00:19:36.003 --> 00:19:38.780
With a bit of rigour and discernment

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.278
we can build sound foundations

00:19:41.278 --> 00:19:46.180
enjoy more justified confidence and generate
our own light

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.618
instead of basking in the false light of magical
heroes.

00:19:58.154 --> 00:20:01.420
Magical heroes aren’t exclusive to religion.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.370
We might look for them in family, friends

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.235
teachers, partners, celebrities, politicians.

00:20:09.235 --> 00:20:12.360
If we’re lucky, the people we try to cast

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.096
as our magical heroes will decline that role.

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:18.280
They’ll reject our unreal expectations

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.989
and weather our disappointment.

00:20:20.989 --> 00:20:23.820
Every rejection of our magical fantasies

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.766
is an opportunity to give up our passive one-down
position

00:20:27.766 --> 00:20:31.389
and fully embrace active independent development.

00:20:31.389 --> 00:20:34.520
If we’re not so lucky, the people we grant

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.938
magical status will accept that status.

00:20:37.938 --> 00:20:40.990
When two parties start feeding off each other

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.170
in a mutually gratifying one-up-one-down fantasy

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.414
that’s a tough bond to break.

00:20:46.414 --> 00:20:49.084
Rational appeals are often useless.

00:20:49.084 --> 00:20:52.980
If our respect and curiosity for truth is
powerful enough

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.800
we might be willing to listen to reason.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.916
But if we’re more invested in comfort than
truth

00:20:58.916 --> 00:21:02.620
— something a surprising number of people
cheerfully admit to —

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.400
we’ll dismiss the most reasonable voices

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.112
as misguided or even malicious.

00:21:09.112 --> 00:21:12.790
Generally speaking, escaping a magical hero
fantasy

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.664
means a prison break from the inside.

00:21:15.664 --> 00:21:17.700
Outside help might be offered.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:24.544
But we have to want to escape our false heroes
ourselves.

00:21:24.544 --> 00:21:28.130
Bruce has felt downtrodden his entire life.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.210
It started with being beaten at home.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.000
Later he was bullied at school.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.876
In his teens, he’s befriended by a man in
a bar.

00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:42.190
They talk about life and get to reflecting
on their grievances.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.946
The man tells Bruce his binary philosophy
—

00:21:45.946 --> 00:21:49.350
in life you’re either predator or prey.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.254
You have to choose which one you are.

00:21:52.254 --> 00:21:55.010
Bruce continues to meet up with his new friend

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.146
who introduces him to a like-minded network

00:21:58.146 --> 00:22:00.980
offering him a replacement family

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.340
and a sense of belonging he’s never experienced.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.652
Over time he’s plied with books and videos

00:22:07.652 --> 00:22:11.211
targeting a specific social group as ‘the
enemy’ —

00:22:11.211 --> 00:22:13.610
the reason the world is wrong.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.510
Bruce’s anger is constantly stoked.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.000
He’s encouraged to dwell on the times he’s
felt downtrodden

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.397
and challenged to do something about it.

00:22:23.397 --> 00:22:24.980
Like a projectile

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.750
he’s filled with ideological fuel and fired
into society.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:35.079
The power he feels in trampling others down
is intoxicating.

00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:37.490
Bruce is the predator now.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.000
And on a righteous mission.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.620
His brutality escalates as he reaches for
more intense highs

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:50.430
from the violence and greater recognition
from his new family.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.517
Eventually, Bruce begins to recruit new members.

00:22:54.517 --> 00:22:56.010
Just like his recruiter

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.090
he won’t care what happens to these individuals.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.297
He’s even stopped caring if he survives
himself.

00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:07.041
Destroying the enemy is all that matters.

00:23:07.041 --> 00:23:09.770
Bedelia has been a human punchbag

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.880
in her abusive family.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.480
The only person who treated her

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.910
like a human was her uncle Tim.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.044
At family events, he always acknowledged her

00:23:19.044 --> 00:23:22.428
while other relatives demeaned and dismissed
her.

00:23:22.428 --> 00:23:25.680
In her teens, when she was involved in a car
crash

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.504
he was the only member of the family to visit
her.

00:23:28.504 --> 00:23:31.730
Just a fleeting visit, barely a minute long.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:37.220
But to Bedelia, it catapulted him to magical
hero status.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.970
In her 30s, Bedelia finally confides in Tim

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.513
about her abuse by the family.

00:23:43.513 --> 00:23:47.040
He’s appalled —&nbsp;but not at them.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.330
He dismisses Bedelia as a selfish child

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.500
and says he’s changed his whole opinion of her.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.000
Betraying her confidence

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.106
he informs Bedelia’s family of her allegations

00:23:58.106 --> 00:24:02.530
and empathises with their apparent bewilderment
and anguish.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:08.034
For days Bedelia’s consumed by doubt and
self-recrimination

00:24:08.034 --> 00:24:12.852
wondering how she can redeem herself in Tim’s
eyes.

00:24:12.852 --> 00:24:17.217
To the starving individual, a crumb is a feast.

00:24:17.217 --> 00:24:20.196
To an abused individual, a scrap of attention

00:24:20.196 --> 00:24:23.200
can feel like a tidal wave of love.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.358
In this distorted headspace

00:24:25.358 --> 00:24:29.528
heroes are easily made from the thinnest material.

00:24:29.528 --> 00:24:32.860
For Bruce, a random sense of belonging

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.860
was enough to cloud the fact his replacement family

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.176
were happy to destroy him for their cause.

00:24:39.176 --> 00:24:43.190
For Bedelia, Tim seemed like a shining star

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.871
but only relative to the excessive darkness

00:24:45.871 --> 00:24:47.766
of the rest of her family.

00:24:47.766 --> 00:24:51.386
In reality he actually paid her very little
attention.

00:24:51.386 --> 00:24:54.000
There was no special connection.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.632
He was no hero.

00:24:56.632 --> 00:24:58.626
In these real life cases

00:24:58.626 --> 00:25:01.018
both Bruce and Bedelia came to realise

00:25:01.018 --> 00:25:04.872
they were looking for family in the wrong
places.

00:25:04.872 --> 00:25:07.776
Fortunately they would both find other people

00:25:07.776 --> 00:25:10.000
who lived up to the word family;

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.246
who showed concern for their welfare

00:25:12.246 --> 00:25:14.763
and a willingness to walk alongside them

00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:17.790
even in the most difficult places.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.513
Recovery wasn’t easy.

00:25:20.513 --> 00:25:23.260
Bruce had to face crushing waves of guilt

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.190
for the violence he’d inflicted

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.720
and work through powerful suicidal urges.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.800
Bedelia was shunned by her entire family including
Tim.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.467
But the presence of authentic love in their
lives

00:25:37.467 --> 00:25:40.576
showed them how deprived they’d previously
been

00:25:40.576 --> 00:25:44.970
and expelled any fantasies of sliding back.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:48.040
Targets of abuse are often starved

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.450
of examples of healthy supportive people.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:59.766
But starving individuals must still learn
to avoid poisonous food.

00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:03.238
Indigo engages Paul as her therapist.

00:26:03.238 --> 00:26:06.671
She sees Paul as someone who’s figured life
out.

00:26:06.671 --> 00:26:09.880
Her goal is to learn his magical insights

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.256
and apply them to her own life.

00:26:12.256 --> 00:26:14.200
Although Paul tells her from the outset

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.380
he’s not there to offer advice

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.882
Indigo continues to ask for it.

00:26:18.882 --> 00:26:23.620
And despite his intentions, Paul finds himself
giving it.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.944
Their exchanges quickly fall into a pattern.

00:26:26.944 --> 00:26:28.982
Indigo describes some problem

00:26:28.982 --> 00:26:32.373
and insists she has no idea what to do.

00:26:32.373 --> 00:26:36.842
Paul tries to spark her thinking with some
suggestions.

00:26:36.842 --> 00:26:40.160
Instead of thinking, Indigo treats Paul’s
suggestions

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.885
as wise instructions which she resolves to
carry out.

00:26:44.885 --> 00:26:46.598
As the weeks go by

00:26:46.598 --> 00:26:50.730
Paul finds himself constantly exhausted after
their sessions

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.684
having done all the thinking.

00:26:52.684 --> 00:26:55.990
Meanwhile Indigo, having done no thinking

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.197
has come to feel completely dependent on Paul.

00:26:59.197 --> 00:27:01.700
Paul is a reluctant hero.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.190
At the start, he fully intended to build

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.450
a strong therapeutic alliance with Indigo

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.184
working to address her problems together.

00:27:09.184 --> 00:27:13.256
But he failed to pick up on her powerful expectations
of him.

00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:15.130
He took her to be more independent

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.280
and self-sufficient than she was.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.740
Until he tackles her expectations and allows
her

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.830
to experience healthy disappointment in him

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.648
he’ll remain glued to a throne he never
wanted.

00:27:26.648 --> 00:27:30.430
This real life case illustrates how we can
be pushed

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:35.742
unwillingly into a hero fantasy by others.

00:27:35.742 --> 00:27:41.310
Livia signs up for a course
run by a self-improvement guru

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:47.037
who offers participants enlightenment, fulfilment
and joy.

00:27:47.037 --> 00:27:50.611
She attends three weeks of exhausting ten-hour
training days

00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:55.129
which she’s led to believe will give her
valuable self-insight.

00:27:55.129 --> 00:27:57.918
She’s told not to criticise the guru

00:27:57.918 --> 00:28:00.840
or reveal any course content to outsiders

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.030
and given pseudo-philosophical justifications

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.690
for both these rules.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.080
She’s constantly fed claims about the course’s
benefits

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.497
and repeatedly urged to sign up for further
courses

00:28:12.497 --> 00:28:15.627
and get friends and family to do the same.

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:19.540
The sessions are sprinkled with pseudo-content
—

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:25.037
a mix of bumper-sticker truisms and impenetrable
esoterica.

00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:27.980
Livia ends the three weeks none the wiser

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.690
and thousands of dollars poorer.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.020
Future courses will repeat this pattern

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:39.413
bombarding participants with endless procedure,
jargon and self-promotion.

00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:42.150
As Livia descends into serious debt

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.620
the single lesson she absorbs is:

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.240
‘buy more courses’.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.360
When we invest in self improvement like therapy
or formal teaching

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.930
we sometimes expect the thinking to be done
for us.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.880
We adopt a consumer mindset:

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.730
we’ve paid money, so we expect a product.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.350
In fact our own thinking is the product.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:11.232
Therapists, teachers, coaches are only there
to facilitate our thinking.

00:29:11.232 --> 00:29:13.280
And for an effective outcome

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.142
we need some idea of what we want to achieve.

00:29:16.142 --> 00:29:18.773
What specific areas we want to address.

00:29:18.773 --> 00:29:21.368
What specific changes we hope to see.

00:29:21.368 --> 00:29:24.451
Problems happen when we take a passive position;

00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:26.730
when we formulate no goals

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.597
or goals too vague to quantify.

00:29:29.597 --> 00:29:33.930
It’s like telling a cab driver ‘Oh just
take me somewhere.’

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.520
Our goals might even be magical.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.357
Like perpetual happiness, freedom from self-doubt.

00:29:40.357 --> 00:29:44.844
This is like telling the driver ‘Take me
to nirvana.’

00:29:44.844 --> 00:29:47.627
Ethical drivers will decline our fare.

00:29:47.627 --> 00:29:53.527
Magical hero drivers will happily take us
for a ride.

00:29:53.527 --> 00:29:57.600
Lena doesn’t relate to the vast majority
of politicians.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.469
Their backgrounds, social circles, lifestyles.

00:30:01.469 --> 00:30:04.487
She longs to see someone like herself in power.

00:30:04.487 --> 00:30:06.910
A maverick. A rebel.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.890
In the elections, she votes for Bena

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.910
who markets herself as a woman of the people.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.426
Bena has no political experience

00:30:15.426 --> 00:30:20.164
and no special education or training in any
identifiable field.

00:30:20.164 --> 00:30:23.501
But she speaks her mind and doesn’t bow
to anyone.

00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:26.055
She won’t be told what to do.

00:30:26.055 --> 00:30:29.687
To Lena’s joy, Bena wins the election.

00:30:29.687 --> 00:30:34.637
Once in office, Bena begins dismantling the
institutions that restrain her.

00:30:34.637 --> 00:30:37.872
She ends long-standing treaties with other
countries.

00:30:37.872 --> 00:30:42.342
She abrogates the rights of social groups
she doesn’t like.

00:30:42.342 --> 00:30:47.018
She disbands oversight committees and anti-corruption
departments.

00:30:47.018 --> 00:30:50.870
In violation of her office, she exploits her
position

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.010
for personal gain through private businesses.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.520
In further violation, she initiates military
force

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.241
to neutralise peaceful protesters.

00:31:00.241 --> 00:31:04.977
Staff who advise against her reckless actions
are dismissed.

00:31:04.977 --> 00:31:07.864
She won’t be told what to do.

00:31:07.864 --> 00:31:10.010
When Lena’s friends condemn

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.736
Bena’s unprecedented abuse of power

00:31:12.736 --> 00:31:15.121
Lena is genuinely baffled.

00:31:15.121 --> 00:31:19.608
To her, Bena is a magical hero who’s shaking
things up.

00:31:19.608 --> 00:31:23.661
A maverick, a rebel. Just like Lena.

00:31:23.661 --> 00:31:26.056
She must be good.

00:31:26.056 --> 00:31:30.856
Sometimes we see some reflection of ourselves
in a magical hero.

00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:35.970
Sometimes it’s just a single trait —&nbsp;one
we strongly identify with.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:40.000
It then becomes easy to project all our other
qualities onto them.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.690
We create a vicarious fantasy that’s hard
to separate ourselves from.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.225
Their success becomes our success.

00:31:47.225 --> 00:31:50.530
And we make the same excuses and rationalisations

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:55.533
for their failures and abuses that we’d
make for our own.

00:31:55.533 --> 00:31:59.692
For John Stuart Mill, there were very few
conceivable justifications

00:31:59.692 --> 00:32:02.905
for the existence of any governing power.

00:32:02.905 --> 00:32:07.574
One of them was to protect the freedoms of
the people it governed.

00:32:07.574 --> 00:32:11.381
Not the freedoms of some,
but the freedoms of all.

00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:13.985
Government was a form of practical service.

00:32:13.985 --> 00:32:17.282
And the power it wielded meant it needed to
be held

00:32:17.282 --> 00:32:19.850
to the highest standards of accountability

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.738
to guard against corruption.

00:32:21.738 --> 00:32:24.820
But when we view our leaders as magical heroes

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.217
we often hold them to the lowest standards
of accountability

00:32:28.217 --> 00:32:30.708
because we’ve built our dreams on them.

00:32:30.708 --> 00:32:35.914
We ignore their corruption&nbsp;or excuse it as
a necessary evil

00:32:35.914 --> 00:32:41.424
in contrast to the unnecessary evil of other
people’s leaders.

00:32:41.424 --> 00:32:44.450
Magical heroes come in many forms —

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:49.383
family, teachers, leaders, gods.

00:32:49.383 --> 00:32:52.510
When we stop looking to them to fulfil our
dreams for us

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.950
and take an active role in achieving them
ourselves

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.605
the impulse to defend their corruption fades.

00:32:59.605 --> 00:33:02.485
And we can acknowledge fraud, incompetence

00:33:02.485 --> 00:33:06.126
and negligence wherever we see it.

00:33:14.913 --> 00:33:16.850
It’s worth mentioning one last kind

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.000
of discipleship many of us fall into.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.344
One where there’s no tangible hero.

00:33:22.344 --> 00:33:25.514
But a system of rewards that draws us in

00:33:25.514 --> 00:33:28.764
disrupts our thinking, stifles our development

00:33:28.764 --> 00:33:32.921
and consumes substantial volumes of our lives.

00:33:32.921 --> 00:33:36.790
As far back as 1950, mathematician Norbert
Wiener

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.348
was reflecting on the idea of machines

00:33:39.348 --> 00:33:42.142
that could collect information from human
beings

00:33:42.142 --> 00:33:46.650
to determine the most probable development
of a situation.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.423
He noted how such machines could be used by
other humans

00:33:50.423 --> 00:33:53.992
to increase their control over the human race.

00:33:53.992 --> 00:33:58.792
But he concluded this technology was unlikely
to be realised

00:33:58.792 --> 00:34:01.400
because, with humans being so complex

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.823
the volume of data required would be impossibly
vast.

00:34:06.823 --> 00:34:12.814
Fast forward to 2017 where, in an interview
with Axios’s Mike Allen

00:34:12.814 --> 00:34:15.933
Sean Parker, former Facebook president

00:34:15.933 --> 00:34:17.921
reflects on the challenge he and his fellow

00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:21.256
Facebook leaders once set themselves:

00:34:21.256 --> 00:34:22.798
how could they consume as much

00:34:22.798 --> 00:34:26.530
of our time and conscious attention as possible?

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.332
They decided they should give users

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:30.796
a little dopamine hit every once in a while

00:34:30.796 --> 00:34:34.029
because someone liked or commented on a post.

00:34:34.029 --> 00:34:37.529
They constructed a social validation feedback
loop

00:34:37.529 --> 00:34:40.456
with users responding to their responders

00:34:40.456 --> 00:34:42.829
and so on, back and forth.

00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:44.867
Parker said this was exactly the kind of thing

00:34:44.867 --> 00:34:47.049
a hacker like himself would come up with

00:34:47.049 --> 00:34:50.980
because it exploited a vulnerability in human
psychology.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.634
He said the inventors and creators consciously
understood

00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:58.590
what they were doing&nbsp;and did it anyway.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.073
Constantly having our attention disrupted
isn’t great.

00:35:02.073 --> 00:35:04.700
Aside from fragmenting our thinking

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.700
the intermittent nature of these positive
dopamine hits

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.406
can make them extremely addictive.

00:35:10.406 --> 00:35:13.807
The user is kept in a state of uncertain anticipation

00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:17.361
waiting for a hit that may or may not come.

00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:20.000
Some creators agonise over what kind of post

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.606
will get a bigger response.

00:35:22.606 --> 00:35:25.730
Social media companies offer them endless tips

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.353
to maximise audience engagement.

00:35:28.353 --> 00:35:30.674
Following these formulaic tips

00:35:30.674 --> 00:35:33.559
creators slowly lose their own voice

00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:36.557
and become generic photocopies.

00:35:36.557 --> 00:35:40.100
But these are just the upfront methods of
moulding us.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.490
The larger threat to individuality

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:46.464
comes from the more insidious data-gathering
side.

00:35:46.464 --> 00:35:49.160
Every time we respond to a notification

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.393
information’s gathered about what kinds
of material engage us.

00:35:54.393 --> 00:35:58.083
Platform software constructs an evermore complex
picture of us.

00:35:58.083 --> 00:36:03.467
And discovers how to extract more attention
from us.

00:36:03.467 --> 00:36:07.519
Our addiction is constantly tweaked by a drug

00:36:07.519 --> 00:36:11.900
that’s constantly learning how to increase
our habit.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.652
We become a slave to the algorithm.

00:36:15.652 --> 00:36:19.690
Computer scientist Jaron Lanier cautions social
media users

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:23.200
about the relentless, robotic, ultimately
meaningless

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.787
behaviour modification they’re subjected
to

00:36:25.787 --> 00:36:29.097
in the service of uncaring algorithms —

00:36:29.097 --> 00:36:31.232
algorithms programmed to target us

00:36:31.232 --> 00:36:34.022
not with good or reliable information

00:36:34.022 --> 00:36:38.577
but simply with what most reliably grabs us.

00:36:38.577 --> 00:36:42.720
Unfortunately sensationalistic misinformation

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.970
is often far more successful at that.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.710
Our online feeds and recommendations

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:51.579
can quickly funnel us into echo chambers

00:36:51.579 --> 00:36:55.180
in which unqualified opinion is magnified
over facts

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.633
with little exposure to differing viewpoints.

00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:02.130
Much like Bruce’s case, many people have
spoken about

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.450
how either they or their friends or family

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.032
became radicalised into some ideology

00:37:07.032 --> 00:37:11.145
by being drawn down a rabbit hole of recommendations.

00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:13.525
When this happens on a global scale

00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:17.346
it can lead to unprecedented levels of tribalism.

00:37:17.346 --> 00:37:20.071
When we encounter disagreement we think:

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.639
How can they be so unaware?

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:26.609
And they think exactly the same about us.

00:37:26.609 --> 00:37:29.730
We can avoid becoming echo chamber drones

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:33.337
by exposing ourselves to a wide variety of
sources

00:37:33.337 --> 00:37:36.720
including sources that conflict with our own.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.749
With firsthand information, we can form our
own judgement

00:37:40.749 --> 00:37:45.145
instead of relying exclusively on secondhand
opinion.

00:37:45.145 --> 00:37:50.573
We can switch off notifications, either selectively
or completely.

00:37:50.573 --> 00:37:53.242
Instead of fitting into their chaotic schedule

00:37:53.242 --> 00:37:55.643
we can make them fit into ours

00:37:55.643 --> 00:37:57.720
and experience the wonderful freedom

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.998
and clarity of uninterrupted thought.

00:38:01.998 --> 00:38:06.211
The idiom ‘Fire is a good servant but a
bad master’

00:38:06.211 --> 00:38:08.545
applies to many things in life

00:38:08.545 --> 00:38:11.143
including social media.

00:38:11.143 --> 00:38:13.682
In its place, it can educate

00:38:13.682 --> 00:38:17.214
break down barriers and unite people.

00:38:17.214 --> 00:38:19.640
When it’s allowed to run wild

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:24.576
it can miseducate, build barriers and divide
people.

00:38:24.576 --> 00:38:27.748
Keeping it in its place is the challenge.

00:38:27.748 --> 00:38:30.000
For all of us.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.660
We often submit to false heroes in the most
desperate times

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.311
precisely because they seem to offer some
escape.

00:38:37.311 --> 00:38:39.486
Which is why it’s during those times

00:38:39.486 --> 00:38:41.393
that we should be most vigilant

00:38:41.393 --> 00:38:45.071
when heroic figures appear offering salvation.

00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:47.422
Before accepting their services

00:38:47.422 --> 00:38:51.697
we need to think carefully about what we might
be surrendering.

00:38:51.697 --> 00:38:54.740
If the gift horse we’re being offered is
a Trojan one

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.339
we’ll be glad we looked it in the mouth.

00:38:57.339 --> 00:38:59.361
Submitting to magical heroes

00:38:59.361 --> 00:39:01.840
might sometimes elevate us emotionally

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.392
but it diminishes us developmentally.

00:39:05.392 --> 00:39:07.631
As Rothbaum and colleagues point out

00:39:07.631 --> 00:39:11.797
it can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of
greater dependence

00:39:11.797 --> 00:39:15.787
increased fear of powerlessness,
increased conformity

00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:19.733
even greater dependence and so on.

00:39:19.733 --> 00:39:25.212
Submitting to tyrants or heroes can have the
same damaging effects.

00:39:25.212 --> 00:39:29.850
To achieve individual freedom, we can be no
one’s slave.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.148
And no one’s disciple.
