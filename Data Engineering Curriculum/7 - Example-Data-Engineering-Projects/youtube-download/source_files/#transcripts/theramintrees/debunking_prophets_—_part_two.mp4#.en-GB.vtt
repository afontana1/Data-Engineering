00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.320
This is the second of a two-part
series looking at prophets —

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.120
the storytellers who claim special knowledge
of hidden supernatural realms

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.260
and unverifiable supernatural beings via revelations.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.660
Having no access to this supposed
special knowledge ourselves

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.880
the rest of us are expected to accept
these prophets’ stories without question.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.600
In fact, we’re expected to believe their alleged revelations with as much conviction

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.420
as if we’d experienced them firsthand.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.420
Born in the 1700s, Thomas Paine, one of
the founding fathers of the United States

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.880
explains the problem with this arrangement.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.220
"Revelation, when applied to religion"

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.140
"means something communicated
immediately from God to man."

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.400
".... But admitting, for the sake of a case,
that something has been revealed to a certain person"

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.840
"and not revealed to any other person,
it is revelation to that person only."

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.380
"When he tells it to a second person, a second
to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on"

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.240
"it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons."

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.760
"It is revelation to the first person only,
and hearsay to every other"

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.040
"and consequently they are not obliged to believe it."

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.540
"It is a contradiction in terms and ideas"

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.840
"to call anything a revelation that comes to us
at second-hand, either verbally or in writing."

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.060
Focussing in on the Abrahamic religions,
Paine continues:

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.980
"When Moses told the children of Israel

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.180
"that he received the two tables
of the commandments from the hands of God"

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.900
"they were not obliged to believe him"

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.740
"because they had no other
authority for it than his telling them so ...."

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.200
"When I am told that the Koran was written in Heaven, and brought to Mahomet by an angel"

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.200
".... I did not see the angel myself, and therefore I have a right not to believe it."

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.340
"When also I am told that a woman, called the Virgin Mary"

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.840
"said, or gave out, that she was
with child without any cohabitation with a man"

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.460
"and that her betrothed husband, Joseph,
said that an angel told him so ...."

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.940
".... neither Joseph nor Mary
wrote any such matter themselves"

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.500
"it is only reported by others that they said so"

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.600
"it is hearsay upon hearsay, and I do not
chose to rest my belief upon such evidence."

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.860
Paine isn’t alone in rejecting hearsay.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.220
Barring exceptional circumstances,
it’s disallowed as evidence in the courts.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.320
What Paine calls ‘hearsay upon hearsay’
is known as ‘double hearsay’.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.300
And it’s interesting to imagine what would happen

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.040
if self-proclaimed prophets tried
to make their cases in a courtroom.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.220
In this atmosphere of probing judicial rigour

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.620
their cases would collapse instantly on two grounds.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.700
The first is the aforementioned concept of hearsay.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.140
Any testimony about unsubstantiated messages
from supernatural beings would be inadmissible.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.260
The second is jury tampering,
formerly known as embracery.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.820
Self-proclaimed prophets depend on promises
and threats to sway their audience.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.880
They dangle the carrot of astounding rewards

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.140
and brandish the stick of unbearable torture.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.380
But bribery and intimidation are
punishable offences in a courtroom setting.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.580
Without these two tactics of hearsay and jury tampering

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.540
by what other means can the
self-proclaimed prophet win over a jury?

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.920
Talking of juries, it’s worth reflecting
on the qualities required of their members.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.900
For instance, jurors are adults, able to process
the information before them critically.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.640
They need to be of sound mind,
able to make sound judgements.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.800
And they need to be impartial, having no
personal interest in the outcome.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.860
The rigorous standards seen in courtrooms

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.120
are specifically designed to minimise prejudicial
elements

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.860
such as fear, ignorance, bias and self-advancement

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.160
that can pervert the course of justice.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.340
But prophets rely on all these prejudicial
elements

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.280
including the selection of children as their jurors

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.999
bypassing impartial sound
critical assessment generation after generation

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.700
via childhood indoctrination.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.600
In criminal cases, a mistaken verdict
is a serious business.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.000
Whether an innocent person is found guilty
or a guilty person is found not guilty

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.580
the consequences for the parties
involved can be life-changing.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.120
But when it comes to prophets

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.560
the consequences of a mistaken verdict
are immeasurably more far-reaching.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.820
When we succumb to their hearsay
and their jury tampering

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.600
and mistakenly accept them
as genuine divine representatives

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.800
we give them the power
to rewrite the very definition of justice.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.940
Just as light bends around a black hole,
distorted by its tremendous gravity

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.100
moral concepts of bad and good
bend around the prophets,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.600
distorted by the infinite divine authority
they claim for themselves.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.320
Child abuse, murder, genocide can all become good
— if the prophets say so.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.120
Critical thinking, knowledge, love can all become bad
— if the prophets say so.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.440
Reasoning ourselves out of this perverted
morality can be extremely difficult

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.620
partly because, generally speaking,
we didn’t reason ourselves into it.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.780
Can’t go back same way you came.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.180
But also because the perverted morality
we’ve been taught becomes normalised.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.960
In a culture where all babies have their little
fingers chopped off, in deference to their prophet

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.240
eight fingers becomes the norm.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.580
The possession of ten fingers
comes to seem disgusting, ungodly —

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.040
a sign of animalistic depravity.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.620
When asked why the possession of ten fingers is wrong

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.240
members of this culture might offer
many spurious answers.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.600
But, time after time

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.960
as the flaws in these answers are exposed,
they’ll give way to the same spurious answer:

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.220
because the prophet said so.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.520
That’s where the thinking stops.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.220
When a culture accepts
the moral authority of a prophet

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.580
that prophet’s prejudices, hangups and delusions

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.140
can be freely expressed
in that culture without challenge.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.000
And&nbsp;until — by reason or by accident — some of its
members manage to look past their prophet,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.820
that culture will remain chained
to a fixed point in history

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.240
becoming extremely — sometimes violently
— resistant to progress.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.960
We need to scrutinise the words of prophets
very closely and ask ourselves:

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.740
do they really reflect superhuman wisdom?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.060
In Alice Walker’s novel, The Color Purple

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.460
14-year-old Celie is married off by an abusive father to an abusive husband, called simply ‘Mr.__’

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.080
to look after his children and his house.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.100
She learns to be an obedient, submissive wife.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.680
A few years go by

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.420
and Mister’s son Harpo falls in love
with a woman called Sofia

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.030
Sofia sees marriage as an equal partnership.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.240
But following his father’s example

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.900
Harpo thinks he should be in charge and tries unsuccessfully to verbally dominate Sofia.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.120
Mister tells Harpo that wives are like children.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.160
He encourages Harpo to give her a good sound
beating to show her who’s boss.

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:26.740
Celie is jealous and resentful of Sofia’s
independent nature.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.792
She notices how Sofia just carries on talking
when Harpo and Mister come in the room.

00:07:31.792 --> 00:07:38.700
She notices the look of pity on Sofia’s face
every time Celie jumps when Mister calls.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.340
And in a sad self-defeating moment

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:48.900
when Harpo approaches Celie for advice
on handling Sofia, she tells him, ‘Beat her.’

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.800
He takes her advice.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.860
But Sofia is strong and in the physical fight
he provokes, he comes off much worse.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.660
To hide his shame, he claims
he was attacked by a mule.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:07.200
Prior to this fight, Celie notes how happy
Harpo and Sofia had been together —

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.220
how after three years Harpo would
still ‘whistle and sing’.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.480
It was Mister’s ideas about wifely
submission

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.120
that caused all the unnecessary tension
in Harpo and Sofia’s marriage.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.700
And yet, according to the self-styled prophet of Islam, Muhammad

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.180
Mister’s ideas about men and women
were pretty much on target.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.620
In passages Muhammad claimed were dictated
to him by an angel on behalf of an all-knowing god

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.560
women are again presented like children

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.360
put under the charge of husbands
who they’re expected to obey.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.920
If they rebel, this supposed all-knowing god
ordered an escalating sequence of punishments.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.980
First admonish her, as Harpo
tried to.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.080
If that doesn’t work, withhold sex from her.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.940
If that doesn’t work, do what
Mister and Celie advised: ‘Beat her’.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.900
In claiming to speak for all-knowing beings,
prophets take on a superhuman burden.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.580
Every single pronouncement they make has to reflect

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.860
the all-encompassing, timeless wisdom
such beings would possess.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.740
This burden of timelessness was underscored
by Muhammad himself

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.240
who proclaimed himself the last prophet
—&nbsp;the seal of the prophets.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.000
His words have to stand for eternity.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.820
But do they?

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.640
An all-knowing being would know that 
— aside from being infantilising and brutalising —

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.720
this sequence of punishments was simply
an unworkable method of conflict resolution.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:43.460
It’s unworkable because it relies on suppression
— keeping someone down in an inferior position.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.940
That’s not a sustainable system.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.140
As the fictional example of
Sofia and Harpo illustrates

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.060
beating doesn’t work with people
who have a healthy sense of self-worth.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:59.460
They don’t tolerate such demeaning, bullying
behaviour and some of them will fight back hard.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.560
But even in Celie’s case, where we see a broken individual who submitted to beatings for years

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.580
a vengeful anger grew inside her
which eventually exploded.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:16.140
Throughout history countless suppressed groups
have risen up to demand fair treatment

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:23.240
demonstrating what an all-knowing being would know: suppression doesn’t solve problems — it creates them.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.960
An all-knowing being would also know the destructive
impact of trying to impose fixed relationship roles.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.260
Those of us with any broad experience
of people will’ve met male-female couples

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:38.780
who have no problem sharing power and treating
each other respectfully as equals.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:44.100
We’ll also have met male-female couples where the
man is very happy for the woman to take charge

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.585
maybe because in their particular case,
out of the two of them

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:53.926
she happens to be more confident,
more organised, more proactive, more experienced.

00:10:53.926 --> 00:10:59.520
Their relationships work because both partners
are a natural, complimentary fit.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.080
Muhammad’s fixed role system in which men
are in charge of women and women devoutly obey

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:11.860
would upset all these healthy, complimentary
dynamics and corrupt these relationships.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.740
One of the fundamental principles
of any wise advice, guideline or law

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.900
is that it should not impinge on healthy systems.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.500
Some have defended Muhammad’s fixed role system

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.476
on the grounds that if it was followed,
it would create stability.

00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:31.080
But the stability defence is fallacious on two counts.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.840
It’s tautological because any system that
everyone followed would create stability.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.120
If everyone followed a system in which women
were in charge of men, there’d be stability.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.260
And it’s also a red herring

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:50.300
because social stability doesn’t mean the rules underpinning that stability are moral or healthy.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.680
Some of the most stable systems
are the most ruthless and sadistic

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.300
using fear and coercion to keep people
in fixed roles that benefit some

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.320
at the great expense of others.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.120
An all-knowing being would know all of this.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.020
But the being Muhammad claimed
to commune with knew none of it.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.480
There is no timeless wisdom here.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.200
There is no far-reaching vision that
encompasses, accommodates and nurtures

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.000
all the healthy variation that exists
within the human species.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.160
Instead we have a painfully parochial, short-sighted vision, grounded in antiquated sexual stereotypes

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:34.340
that attempts to squeeze people into narrow,
fixed roles, stifling their healthy, diverse natures.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:39.500
Coming from an all-knowing being, this relationship advice makes no sense whatsoever.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.800
What makes perfect sense is that this is the advice
of a seventh-century merchant warlord

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.840
whose ideas are deeply rooted in the
less-enlightened social values of his own time.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.360
Apologists for Muhammad’s supposed revelations

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.820
offer various red herrings to give a misleading
impression of sexual equality.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.220
Some say Muhammad promoted
equality of basic humanity

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.860
by declaring that men and women
originated from the same source.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:12.300
But by that reasoning, slaves and their masters came from the same source. It doesn’t make them equal.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.020
Some say Muhammad promoted
equality of social responsibility

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.840
by declaring men and women protectors of one another.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.820
But the charge of protecting each other
does not give them equal social standing.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.740
Some say Muhammad promoted
the right to receive a fair share of wealth.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.640
But anyone familiar with Muhammad’s inheritance laws

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.960
knows that female children inherit
half as much as male children.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.440
Calling these unequal sums a ‘fair share’
doesn’t magically make them fair.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.120
Some apologists have argued that merely giving
a woman any set share of inheritance

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.560
was a right unthinkable in many societies.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.800
This is a ‘be grateful for crumbs’ argument.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.080
Offering people a few more rights than they might get
in some other societies is nothing to brag about.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.060
If every society condoned slavery
for adults and children

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.120
then one society declared children immune

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.360
we could call it a step in the right direction,
but not evidence of superhuman wisdom.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.440
It’s true that some self-styled prophets
might make what — at the time —

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.940
appear to be some revolutionary advances

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.460
including offering a few more rights to certain groups.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:25.660
But an all-knowing being would be able to communicate human rights in their complete final form

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.960
especially if it was communicating them to its
final prophet, as Muhammad claimed to be.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.940
And yet our understanding of rights has surpassed
Muhammad’s unsurpassable revelations.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.890
The 2:1 sexual ratio is seen in other areas.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:44.260
For instance, in surah 2, verse 282 of the Qur’an

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.520
Muhammad claimed it was divinely
revealed that in judicial circumstances

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.540
two female witnesses were required
to stand in for one male witness.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.680
This was so that if one of the women
made a mistake, the other could help her.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.160
But why do women need this backup while men don’t?

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.320
What abiding characteristic do women lack
to warrant this strange remedial measure?

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.140
If, for example, self-confidence was the issue,
this surah should read:

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.180
.... And if there are not two
self-confident people [available]

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.940
then [bring] a self-confident person
and two less self-confident people

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.900
from those whom you accept as witnesses

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.280
so that if one of the less self-confident people
errs, then the other can remind ....

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.780
Generalising a trait like poorer
self-confidence to all women here

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:32.880
simultaneously undermines self-confident women
and fails to support unconfident men.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.980
Again, an all-knowing being would know
this was a distorted, inferior system.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.980
But Muhammad presented it
as timeless, unsurpassable wisdom.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.780
Some Muslim apologists make my case for me

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:50.060
when they respond with distaste to some of
Muhammad’s declarations about men and women

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.780
or flat-out deny he made them.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.940
In a video called ‘attacking beliefs’, I mentioned
a passage from the Hadith

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.800
—&nbsp;the multi-authored reports of the life of Muhammad
written and collected years after his death —

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.308
in which Muhammad is quoted saying:

00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:10.120
"If a husband calls his wife to his bed and
she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger"

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.860
"the angels will curse her till morning."

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.440
An ex-Muslim chum of mine said that years ago

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.100
he’d questioned a Muslim leader
on this specific passage.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.920
The leader suggested Muhammad
wouldn’t’ve said such a thing

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.760
and that the passage had to have some hidden context.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.500
He suggested it might refer to a wife
who’d lost interest in her husband

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.640
because she was having an affair.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.280
Clearly, without any mitigating context

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.500
the apparent promotion of sexual coercion
depicted here makes for difficult reading.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:44.020
But making assumptions about what Muhammad
did or didn’t say here is no casual affair.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.700
The consequences for a believer can be substantial.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.490
If this Hadith was intended for all wives

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:55.780
but it’s mistakenly assumed there’s some
hidden context that refers only to adulterous wives

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.860
then faithful wives would think it’s
ok for them to refuse their husbands

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.220
and would unknowingly be cursed for doing so.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.549
Conversely, if a hidden context does exist

00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:09.040
that refers specifically to adulterous wives

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.560
but it’s mistakenly assumed that
this Hadith applies to all wives

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.140
then faithful wives would be vulnerable to sexual coercion when that was never intended.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.820
Either way, if a mistaken assumption is made

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.760
the wife pays for it.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.980
So, what’s a wife to do?

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.680
It is of course conceivable that some hidden context
for this Hadith might be unearthed in the future.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.140
But there’s no guarantee that this new context
wouldn’t be even more reprehensible in nature.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.340
Surah 58 verse 22 of the Qur’an

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:45.520
asserts that no believer can have affection
for family members who oppose Islam.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.940
I’ve long been aware of this anti-family passage.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:54.925
But a few months ago, a hidden context was illuminated by a great YouTuber called The Masked Arab

00:17:54.925 --> 00:18:00.440
who gives in-depth Islamic scriptural context
and references on a range of subjects.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.740
He cited the work of Ibn Kathir, described as a
highly respected and influential Islamic scholar

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:13.060
and an expert on tafsir — an Arabic word
meaning ‘exegesis’ or ‘interpretation’.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.120
The Masked Arab noted that, in explaining
the context of this Qur’an verse

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.800
Kathir mentions an assortment of relatives,
friends and special representatives

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.100
of the central Islamic prophet Muhammad

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.309
who each killed or intended to kill
non-believing family members

00:18:28.309 --> 00:18:35.620
including fathers, sons, brothers or other
relatives — and were praised for doing so.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.000
Hidden contexts don’t always have a redeeming nature.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.100
They can sometimes reveal
unexpected depths of depravity.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.700
Self-styled prophets take on a superhuman burden.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:52.180
The words of those who claim to speak for all-knowing
beings must reflect that timeless wisdom.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.260
Unjust religious laws are often defended
with the claim

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.920
that humans just aren’t intelligent enough
to see the perfect divine plan behind them.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.120
But the ‘perfect divine plan’ argument could be
used to justify any conceivable act

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.280
— including the amputation of children’s fingers.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.620
We don’t need to possess divine intelligence

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:17.580
to understand that laws that encourage bullying,
suppression, inequity and sexual coercion

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.160
don’t originate from a morally superior
or praise-worthy source.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.260
Unable to substantiate their claims with hard evidence

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.780
prophets repeatedly fall back on
appeals to the unknown.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.180
For instance, they might present their
audience with an apparent mystery

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.660
and offer some spurious interpretation for it
that seems to support their bogus claims.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:46.460
One type of apparent mystery presented
by prophets is known as a ‘miracle’

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.640
an event that seems to defy our understanding.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:55.420
In 1990, former sports presenter David Icke
rebranded himself as a visionary

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.860
after reportedly receiving
spiritual messages from a psychic

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.860
telling him he was meant ‘to heal the earth’.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.160
He declared that the world was
an illusion — a ‘holographic reality’ —

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.940
in which humans were being secretly exploited
by a race of reptilian shape-shifters

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.500
that feed off the emotion of fear.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.700
As a comparison, he’s cited the film The Matrix

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.620
in which humans are immersed in virtual reality

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.880
so that they can be secretly exploited by machines.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.600
In support of this claim

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:31.100
he’s cited stunts like walking through fire,
and walking on lava as examples of miracles.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:36.360
He’s suggested these miracles are able to be performed if you can disconnect your sense of reality

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.160
from the consensus belief that
fire burns and legs get burned.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.920
If you realise it’s all illusion

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.700
—&nbsp;or to put it in Matrix language:

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.460
"There is no spoon."

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:54.600
Alongside David, let’s now put another individual
associated with similarly impressive-sounding stunts:

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.140
the Christian messiah, Jesus, whose
reported ‘miracles’ include walking on water.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.620
So between David and Jesus

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.400
we have two examples of purported miracles

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.380
involving people walking on substances
they shouldn’t be able to walk on.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.480
But while David’s lava-walking was presented

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.760
in support of the claim that the universe
is a holographic illusion

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.580
Jesus’s hydro-ambulation was presented
in support a very different claim.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.020
Here, there’s no suggestion that the world isn’t real.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.580
Here, it’s claimed that miracles
are caused by a single powerful being

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.880
who can bend the laws of physics

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.280
— a god called Yahweh, of which
Jesus was the earthly representative.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.400
These different suggestions about the cause
of miracles conflict with each other.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.120
At least one of these individuals must be wrong.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.640
Possibly both.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.380
The good news we don’t have to waste
our time puzzling over either of them.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.880
What we notice, when we pay attention
to what’s going on here

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.840
is that neither individual has provided
any connection whatsoever

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.620
between these supposed miracles
and their supposed causes.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:05.280
When magicians reveal the secret processes
behind their tricks, they provide the connection.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.580
When we see the scaffolding
holding up the levitating man

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.860
we gain insight. We understand.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:16.300
When we’re merely told the magician
has special powers, we don’t understand.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.060
We haven’t been given an explanation.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.840
We’ve been given a story — 
something with zero explanatory power.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.340
When lava-walking is presented
as a miracle, it’s a story.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:35.280
When the principles behind lava-walking are conveyed
in terms we can understand, it’s an explanation.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.840
And it might come as news to David Icke but the
science behind lava-walking is well understood.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.080
Our ability to walk on lava or hot coals relies
on that fact that these carbon-based surfaces

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.160
are relatively poor conductors

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.260
so their heat is transferred less effectively
than high-conducting materials such as metals

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.640
which can easily burn flesh
at much lower temperatures.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.720
But even with its low conductivity

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.740
lava can only be endured for a matter
of seconds before burns are sustained.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.220
One consequence of understanding
the principles behind so-called miracles

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.020
is that we can start making predictions.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.120
For instance, we can predict that we’ll never see
David Icke agreeing to deliver his lengthy seminars

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.160
while standing on lava.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.520
If he truly believed his physical body
was an illusion, as he claimed

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.700
—&nbsp;and as he invites us to believe —

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.580
then he should have no problem
holding his own feet to the fire.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.500
But, because we now understand
the principles behind lava-walking

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.280
we can safely predict it’s not going to happen.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.920
The Bible isn’t full of explanations.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.520
It’s full of stories.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.840
For any one of the miracles it depicts

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.160
we could concoct all kinds of stories.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.440
Take the miracle of Jesus raising
Lazarus from the dead.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.700
We could claim that Lazarus represents
the next stage in human evolution;

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.240
that Lazarus is a monkey overlord
exploiting us with holographic illusions;

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.440
that Jesus possessed alien cloning technology;

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.700
that Lazarus was an avatar.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.840
If Jesus had presented these stories,
rather than his Yahweh story

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.660
would we now be believing them instead?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.680
Far from standing out as people
who should be listened to

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.440
those who present miracles in support of their claims

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.100
instantly mark themselves out as suspect.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.420
In attempting to use miracles as currency

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.400
they show us they’re not in the business
of providing explanations.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.950
They’re in the business of selling stories.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:32.320
And when we buy their stories,
we pay a greater price than we know.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:38.080
We need to take self-proclaimed prophets off
their pedestals and bring them down to earth.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.420
When people encourage us not to think, we need to
think twice about the company we’re keeping.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.120
We need to take note of any overbearing
or threatening language

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.940
being used to try and shut down our critical thinking
and encourage our compliance.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.960
We need to give a wide berth to
those who punish requests for proof.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.920
False prophets often make demonstrable blunders based on their own limited knowledge

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.800
failing to imagine that our expanding knowledge
might expose them in the future.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.240
Joseph Smith failed to foresee that our
discoveries about Egyptian hieroglyphics

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.440
would expose his false translation of Egyptian
funerary texts as the Book of Abraham.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.260
While supposedly channelling
all-knowing beings from distant planets

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.486
UFO prophet Dorothy Martin made several blunders

00:25:25.486 --> 00:25:28.700
including a claim that the scientific term ‘sound barrier’

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.240
referred to a barrier around the earth
that had been punctured by bombs

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.040
and let extraterrestrial communication through

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.760
— when in fact the term simply refers to the
sudden increase in drag an object experiences

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.340
as it approaches the speed of sound.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.400
Founder of Scientology Lafayette Ronald Hubbard

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.020
claimed aliens had been transported
to earth by space planes

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.260
that looked exactly like earth’s DC8 aeroplanes.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:59.560
But an aeroplane’s wings are aerodynamically designed specifically to exploit the properties of air to create lift.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.800
They would be redundant in space.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.560
Anyone can invent a set of laws to live by

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.220
but what’s striking in the case of self-styled prophets
is that they’re devoid of the enduring social insights

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.360
we would expect from the superhuman
authorities they claim to represent.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.620
Those who use miracles to support their claims
disqualify themselves from consideration.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.740
Any number of outlandish claims could be
made about the same miracle.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:30.100
If no explanatory connection is made between
miracle and cause, it’s just story-telling.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.840
We need to take great care
about who we put on pedestals.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.480
That’s especially true when we’re talking about
people who claim some superhuman authority.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:45.020
Because if we succumb to their authority,
we give them licence to redefine our entire reality.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.460
Our susceptibility to prophets begins with ourselves

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.100
—&nbsp;how hungry we are for truth rather than comfort;

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:57.460
how determined we are to demand good evidence
rather than accept dogmatic assertions;

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.520
how ready we are to draw attention
to the problems we find

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.160
rather than allow them to drift
into soft focus and forget about them.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.960
We should also keep in mind that
the manipulative tactics used by prophets

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.520
aren't the exclusive domain of religion.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.700
We find similar tactics in other areas including
politics, economics and education.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:23.640
Wherever we find them, they
should raise red flags and spark our scrutiny.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.260
Billions of us are living with
bogus stories about the world.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:32.060
We get swept up in those stories
and fail to investigate their origins.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.940
We think our faith is in the story,
but our faith is in the storyteller.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.460
And storytellers abound.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.140
These are the human beings
who design the world’s religions;

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:48.240
who generate all the unsubstantiated,
contradictory detail we hear about gods

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:55.940
— the detailed rituals, the detailed mythical histories,
the detailed lists of bizarre, unjust laws.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.900
The time is long overdue for debunking prophets.
