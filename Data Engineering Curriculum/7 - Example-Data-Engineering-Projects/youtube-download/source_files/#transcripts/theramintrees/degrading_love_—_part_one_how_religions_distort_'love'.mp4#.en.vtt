00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.000
‘I love you’

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.560
This simple phrase, expressed
in countless languages down the centuries

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.660
has performed many roles.
It’s served as a lovers’ mantra;

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
an affirmation of family bonds;
a sex-worker’s roleplay;

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.539
an emotional blackmailer’s weapon;
a domestic abuser’s justification;

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.930
a celebrity’s message to fans;
a stalker’s confession;

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.170
a songwriter’s lyric
.... to name just a few.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.310
Clearly, what lies behind a declaration of
love isn’t always love.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.450
The proof of the pudding is in the eating

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.740
and we shouldn’t let a little sugar-coating
trick us into accepting an inferior product.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.220
Of the declarations of love
I’ve received in my time

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.460
a substantial percentage share a peculiar distinction

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.180
in that they were supposedly made on behalf
of the most loving beings ever to exist.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.700
Beings whose love supposedly 
sets the diamond standard.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.460
Beings called gods.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.560
In view of these extravagant claims,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.020
it’s reasonable to expect a model of love
that surpasses anything

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.940
even the most benevolent human being could offer.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.360
Instead, we find a phenomenon

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.320
that in its most innocuous form inspires conflict
just as effectively as comfort,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.500
and at its most lethal, is underpinned

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.180
by corruption, oppression, negation,
narcissism, enslavement and delusion.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.620
Folks who’ve approached me over the years
with promises of their god’s love

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.920
have responded in various ways 
when I’ve declined their offer.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.540
Some have acknowledged my rejection respectfully.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.620
Others have suggested 
I must be ‘damaged’ in some way,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.040
expressing hopes that I might someday be ‘healed’.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.680
Others have nosedived into zealot mode

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.180
criticising my ingratitude for what seems
to them the most precious gift.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.930
In these two videos, I want to set out my
reasons for rejecting this apparent gift

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.130
explaining why all of us 
— including them — deserve better.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.440
At school, I belonged to a group 
called Christian Union.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.600
Besides Bible reading and prayers 
to the Christian god Yahweh

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.260
activities included other 
playful, improvisational exercises.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.920
I remember two sessions that 
focussed specifically on Yahweh’s love.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.460
The first one united the group in seemingly
unstoppable enthusiasm.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.040
The second was a disaster, creating huge tension
and leaving the group confused and fragmented.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.380
In the first session, 
one of the teachers, Ms Chapel

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.400
wrote on the blackboard the unfinished sentence
‘God’s love is like ....’

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.319
We were all invited to complete the analogy.
There was an avalanche of answers.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.210
‘God’s love is like an elevator 
— it lifts you up.’

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.180
‘God’s love is like a volcano 
—&nbsp;hot and explosive.’

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.420
‘God’s love is like the sun 
— it lights up the world.’

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.140
‘God’s love is like a rock 
— it’s solid and reliable.’

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.840
And so on. High praise indeed.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.580
And yet not a single one of us had ever
experienced Yahweh or his love

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.540
— a fact that was admitted months later

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.280
when I pressed the whole group 
for details about their experiences.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.100
So how could we produce 
this stream of glowing analogies?

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.780
The term ‘creation ex nihilo’ is often
used in reference to the belief

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.660
that the universe was fashioned
from nothing by gods.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.580
But, in a universe devoid of detectable gods,
the term applies in reverse.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.380
We have to create gods from nothing.
We have to animate absence.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.620
How this is done is no mystery.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.820
We see the same principles 
in action after bereavements.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.460
When loved ones die

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.680
many of us continue to behave ‘as if they’re with us.’

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.540
We talk about them. We talk to them.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.120
We reflect on physical reminders of them.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.820
When we do these things 
with enough frequency and focus

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.880
the ‘as if’ seems to fade, and we can 
lull ourselves into a powerful fantasy

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.020
that they are indeed with us.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.320
What we’re really doing 
is keeping our memories vividly alive.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.840
We use exactly the same methods 
to breathe life into non-existent deities.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.980
We keep physical reminders of them to reflect on.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.860
We talk to them in prayer

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.020
—&nbsp;in some religions, this is required several
times every day, maintaining frequency and focus.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.520
And lastly, we talk about them.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.460
But here, there’s a problem.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.500
We have absolutely no memories to draw on.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.020
It’s no good pointing to some 
wizened old deity in a dusty old book,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.840
depicting some bygone magical epoch
when stupefying public miracles, angelic visitations

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.080
and even divine interactions were commonplace.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.500
Plainly, we don’t live in that world.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.520
We see no grand suspensions of the physical laws.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.120
No angels come knocking on our doors.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.140
And no divine voices rumble across the globe.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.420
Just resounding silence.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.100
Simply put, if we honestly reported
our actual experience of gods

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.820
we’d have precisely nothing to say.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.300
So we have to create something out of nothing.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.240
To do this, appropriately enough, 
we flip concepts into their opposites.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.200
Beings that are nowhere to be found

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.640
get magically flipped into beings who are everywhere

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.680
found in every moment and every location in the universe.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.040
Beings with no detectable existence

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.960
get magically flipped into 
beings that constitute all existence.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.140
If human love is expressed in the actions of humans of humans

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.080
then divine love is expressed in the actions of the universe

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.100
— the day-to-day events that we call ‘life’.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.280
With this distorted concept in place, 
we can now claim as much love as we want.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.420
If we get a new job, this apparent gift from
the universe can be claimed as divine love.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.000
If we lose both legs in an accident, we can
claim divine love here too

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.400
—&nbsp;the universe didn’t let us die.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.400
If we die after a drawn-out, agonising bout of cancer

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.600
even this can be spun into a claim
of divine love by those we leave behind

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.300
— the universe ended our suffering.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.340
Every experience becomes 
a potential win for divine love

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.640
— either because of what did happen 
or what mercifully didn’t happen.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.060
Branches of some religions give particular
focus to more negative experiences.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.300
In his ‘Revival of Religious Learnings’,
Al-Ghazali

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.600
— a revered Islamic theologian and philosopher
born in the 11th century —

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.880
conveys the signs of love from the Islamic
god, Allah:

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.880
‘The Prophet said: When God loves a servant.
He throws him into dangers and difficulties.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.500
‘When he loves him with full love, 
He purifies him making him sincere.’

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.740
Later on, I’ll return to this curious term
‘making him sincere’.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.040
So even though we have 
no actual experiences of gods,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.880
by interpreting arbitrary life events 
as signs of divine love,

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.840
we can create a limitless supply 
of fantasy-based pseudo-experiences of gods

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.300
to help sustain the illusion that they’re with us.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.180
Which is how, one lunchtime,
a group of children in a London school

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.880
were able to generate a torrent of analogies
about the gigantic love of a god

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.520
that every one of those children would later
admit they’d never experienced.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.840
But this big, big love brings 
some big, big problems.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.520
In Davis Grubb’s thriller ‘Night of the Hunter’

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.600
Preacher Harry Powell roams the American countryside,
murdering widows.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.880
As he drives, he thanks his god for sending
him money to preach his word

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.060
—&nbsp;money taken from his victims.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.640
Harry Powell believes his god loves him too

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.870
—&nbsp;and that his god demonstrates that love
by lining up victims for him.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:12.460
By inventing a bogus love that can be found
in any life event with no standard of verification,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.600
we don’t just create a resource to comfort the meek.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.920
We create a resource for anyone — including bullies, demagogues, supremacists, murderers —

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.460
who can and do use it to justify their belief

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.580
that the gods are on their side.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.480
The potential for abuse here is especially underscored

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.620
when believers are instructed
to find signs of love in ‘dangers and difficulties’,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.680
as Al-Ghazali indicates.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.340
Dangers and difficulties are often warning signs

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.920
to stop what we’re doing 
because it’s harmful to ourselves or others.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.660
We also have to ask: is this 
a veiled invitation to martyrdom?

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.820
After all, if we commit abusive and illegal acts

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.540
dangers and difficulties will swiftly come our way.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.699
Is that a sign of divine love?

00:08:55.699 --> 00:09:02.039
Moreover, if we reduce our dangers and difficulties
by living in peace and harmony with our fellow humans

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.120
is that to be taken as a sign that we’re not loved?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.900
This is the mess we get into

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.840
when we attempt to satisfy our 
human longing for love by illegitimate means.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.640
In that first Christian Union session, we were all 
too swept up in the moment to notice any problems.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.020
But in another session a few weeks later,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.420
the problems were painfully obvious.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.420
A Christian guest speaker — I’ll call him Bill —

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.920
had been invited to talk about his faith.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.700
I later found out he and Ms Chapel attended
the same evangelical church.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.880
Bill was an actor. We recognised him from
a beer commercial on TV.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.980
So it wasn’t surprising that 
he was a great storyteller.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.820
He recounted his spiritual journey 
with contagious humour and passion.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.540
And things might’ve been okay 
— if he’d stuck to his script.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.880
But he decided to improvise.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.900
He’d been talking about his experience of Yahweh’s love

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:59.480
and in a moment of inspiration he announced that 
he could feel that love in the room right now.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.820
He looked around at each of us in turn.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.800
Then he uttered four deadly words:

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.769
‘Can you feel it?’

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:08.489
I was stumped.

00:10:08.489 --> 00:10:11.600
I couldn’t say ‘yes’;&nbsp;that would be a lie.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.920
But I couldn’t say ‘no’, for various reasons.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.520
First, on the most basic level, it seemed rude.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.580
Bill was clearly going for a moment here

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.620
and saying ‘no’ seemed to stomp all over it.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.080
Second, we’d been very effectively 
trained in Christian Union

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.740
to always agree with and affirm experiences of Yahweh.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.100
Third, if Bill could actually 
feel Yahweh’s love and I couldn’t

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.380
maybe that meant there was something wrong with me.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.340
Gradually I became aware that none of 
the other children were answering ‘yes’ either.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.940
When I looked round, I saw they were all just as confused.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.280
Faced with a circle of mute mouths, 
Bill started repeating his question

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.420
and began targeting specific individuals.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.160
Still no one answered.
His tone became impatient and interrogating.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.760
The tension became excruciating.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.160
I remember looking over at Ms Chapel,
sitting on the sidelines

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.900
and noticing that her face had frozen in a sickly grin.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.100
I realised she could see the problem.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.270
Gradually, more members of the group 
started looking over at her

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.450
until eventually the only person 
who wasn’t was Bill.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.470
When he finally followed suit, 
Ms Chapel announced we were out of time.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.990
The room emptied with uncharacteristic speed
and the incident was never mentioned.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.270
There was something odd about Bill’s behaviour
that I couldn’t pinpoint it at the time.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.910
Some time later I realised what it was.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.900
When we see that someone’s 
confused by something we’ve said

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.960
we instinctively try to rectify the situation.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.280
We enquire about what’s confusing them.
We rephrase. We offer explanations.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.220
Bill did none of this.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.760
He saw we were all baffled by his question

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.840
but, bizarrely, he just kept repeating it
— with escalating frustration.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.600
This wasn’t about understanding. 
It was about compliance.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.980
Bill wanted to hear some yeses 
from this group of 12- and 13-year-olds.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.680
Pressure tactics are widespread in religion.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.180
We see it when children are 
pressurised into ‘speaking in tongues’.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:13.340
Children who are quite understandably reluctant 
to participate in this ridiculous, undignified babbling

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.520
are warned if they don’t open their mouths,
the holy spirit can’t talk.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.900
And soon the gibberish flows.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.160
Thankfully we didn’t succumb to Bill’s pressure tactics.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.620
But I know from years of correspondence

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.160
that many folks have suffered 
with tremendous guilt and anxiety

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.320
because they never felt the sensation 
of ‘divine love’ that others claimed to feel.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.460
So what exactly does this sensation feel like?

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.640
Here are just a few responses 
gathered from the internet.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.860
‘a wonderful peace and bliss.’

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.879
‘You’ll know it’s the real thing because
mere words will not be able to describe it’

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:51.019
‘warmness in your chest, peace of mind,
peace of heart, joy

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.280
‘numbness in your legs a little bit like electricity’

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.000
‘Sort of a pat on the head.’

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.229
‘.... it’s [sic] beyond words.

00:12:57.229 --> 00:12:59.229
‘You will have to experience it for yourself

00:12:59.229 --> 00:13:02.089
‘to understand the true feeling of God’s love.’

00:13:02.089 --> 00:13:06.749
These responses pretty much reflect the kinds of reactions I’ve had from people in private conversation.

00:13:06.749 --> 00:13:10.329
What’s immediately striking is that people
are clearly describing

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:13.849
wildly different and incompatible sensations.

00:13:13.849 --> 00:13:15.820
And the feelings aren’t always fluffy.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.320
A Christian once told me 
divine love felt like fear.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.580
This is the chaos you get 
when people are urged

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.320
to identify some physical sensation 
without any guiding criteria.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.220
So what justifications do people give for
ascribing divinity to these diverse sensations?

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.759
Some say it’s because they can’t explain them.

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:40.019
But failure to explain something 
isn’t evidence of divinity, just ignorance.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.080
Some say it’s because the sensations
 happen when they think about their god.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.820
Well, we get all kinds of physical sensations when we think about various significant individuals in our lives

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.280
— including humans, animals 
and even fictional characters —

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.000
from dull nausea to heart-pounding outrage

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.220
to sleepy peace to dizzy euphoria.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.900
Would we argue that these individuals 
are exerting some metaphysical force on us

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.860
to produce these sensations?

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.080
Of course not.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.340
What’s ironic is that if we look at the argument being presented here

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.060
the connection between thought 
and sensation is already made:

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.540
the sensations happen when they think about their god.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.320
They have it in their own words:

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.240
thought gives rise to sensation.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.000
Some take refuge in the claim
that they just know it for a fact.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.860
But claims of infallibility are 
extremely hazardous to work with

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.700
— as the Catholic popes no doubt discovered.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.660
Papal infallibility was declared 
in formal doctrine in the 1800s.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.260
It didn’t mean everything the popes uttered
was ‘preserved from error’

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.420
— only certain rare pronouncements on faith.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.200
The reason for this rarity becomes clear 
when you consider what happens

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.700
if any new infallible statement is found to refute any previous infallible statement.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.560
Infallibility allows no refutation.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.140
Every infallible statement made 
throughout history has to line up.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.640
One single contradiction and the game’s up.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.180
Far from offering popes some wonderful freedom
to say what they like and have it accepted as truth

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.960
papal infallibility walls them in

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.880
progressively limiting what they’re able to say.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.120
Wise pontiffs will make as few 
officially infallible statements as possible.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.440
In everyday life, people aren’t always so cautious.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.420
They claim to ‘just know’ all the time.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:33.980
And fatal contradictions quickly arise
when their supposedly infallible testimonies

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.220
don’t line up with those of others.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:42.880
Some folks describe divine love as sensations 
we’re all familiar with —&nbsp;joy, warmth, fear;

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.240
others claim that the defining feature of
the sensation is that it’s impossible to describe.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.820
A sensation can’t be both possible and impossible to describe.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.640
Some folks present divine love as 
one specific, distinctive type of sensation;

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.340
others suggest divine love can be experienced 
in completely different ways by different people.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.940
A sensation can’t be both one distinctive
sensation and many unrelated sensations.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.300
These contradictions demonstrate that at least
some of these people must be wrong.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.600
Which in turn demonstrates that it’s perfectly
possible to believe divine love is unmistakable

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.560
—&nbsp;and yet be mistaken.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.580
The major religions have us chasing ‘divine love’

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.000
in arbitrary life events and 
arbitrary physical sensations.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.140
We might as well be chasing clouds.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.280
In many species, the offspring’s survival 
will hinge on it’s parents’ protection.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.260
In these cases, the bond between parent and offspring 
is predictably extremely intense.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.100
Parents develop muscularly 
protective instincts towards their offspring.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.060
And offspring develop equally muscular 
trusting instincts towards their parents.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:02.180
But sometimes, this bond gets hijacked 
by other species for their own purposes.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.900
The cuckoo is a ‘brood parasite’

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.700
that exploits the parental instincts 
of other species like reed warblers

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:12.800
by laying its own eggs in the their nests, fooling them into treating the young cuckoo as their own.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.220
When it hatches, the cuckoo is hardwired to push all the other eggs out of the nest

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:22.380
so that the adopted parent can focus exclusively on feeding its mammoth appetite.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.300
A reverse example, where a false parent 
is introduced, is seen with the goose.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.960
Within the first few hours of hatching from their egg

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.340
baby geese will bond with 
the first suitable object they experience

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.180
and then follow that object over land, water and air.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.600
In the wild, this first object will generally be their parent.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.180
But many humans have exploited 
this process, known as ‘imprinting’

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.480
to gain amazing video footage of geese in flight

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.380
by establishing themselves as that first object

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:56.240
so that when they later take to a speedboat
or hang-glider, the imprinted geese will follow.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.520
Human children are dependent on their parents
for an unusually long developmental period

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.240
compared to other species.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.540
Typically, they’ll display an 
unquestioning trust and submissiveness

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.760
to their parents for a significant part 
of that development.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.720
In theory, this should a good survival strategy

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.740
because their parents are likely to be the most fiercely protective adults in those formative years.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:22.020
To mistrust or resist their parents at that early stage might actively endanger them.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.500
But sometimes, these survival instincts 
are hijacked for other purposes

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.880
—&nbsp;not by other species, but by ideologies.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.360
Religions such as the various branches of
Christianity and Islam

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.360
attempt to introduce a false father in the
form of an invisible god

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.500
— a parasitic parent that 
will divert and endlessly exploit

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.560
the child’s natural instincts trust and submission.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.420
In healthy human parent-child relationships

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.740
the growing child develops into 
an independent, self-reliant adult.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:57.100
Unquestioning trust and submission resolve
into healthy challenge and mutual respect.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.080
Parental hypocrisies are acknowledged and recede.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.670
But in the parasitic god relationship

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.160
the growing child becomes fixed 
in an undeveloped infantilised stage

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.760
remaining psychologically stunted in a child’s mindset

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.840
Unquestioning trust and submission are 
perpetually demanded under threat of punishment.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.220
Parental hypocrisies are denied and continue.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.660
But the most striking difference is this:

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:28.500
In healthy human-child relationships, the parent 
gives relentless demonstrations of love to the child

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:37.360
— actively protecting, affirming, reassuring,
empathising, nurturing and teaching.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:43.700
In the parasitic god relationship, the parent demands relentless demonstrations of love from the child

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.120
requiring constant declarations and acts of devotion.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.240
In fact, with this role reversal 
of the child feeding the parent

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.020
the parasite that gods 
most closely resemble is the cuckoo.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.100
The baby bird with the ever-open beak.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:04.420
While these cuckoos don’t themselves have
the ability to kill —&nbsp;being mythical characters —

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:09.920
stories in the Bible and Qur’an such as
Abraham’s instruction to sacrifice his own son

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.460
depict both Yahweh and Allah desiring to have family members ready to kill each other on command.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:21.340
What kind of loving parents want their families
ready to kill each other?

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.880
This should be the point where families wake up

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.620
and see that they’ve been taken over by
something extremely malignant.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.680
But the cuckoo works 
to separate them from each other.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.980
We come back to Al-Ghazali’s commentary,
and the curious concept of making a servant ‘sincere’.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.540
What’s meant by this is that

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.600
‘God does not leave for him his family and property ....

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.360
‘He makes him separate from others

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.160
‘and God comes in between him
and other people and things.’

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.120
And apparently gods aren’t the only ones 
seeking to come between family members.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.580
Within Islam, the Hadith is&nbsp;a collection of books 
written long after the death of Muhammad

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.000
— the self-proclaimed messenger of the Islamic god, Allah.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.400
The Hadith gathers together reports 
of Muhammad’s life from various sources.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.940
These have been subdivided by Islamic scholars

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:10.180
into classifications of 
authentic, good, weak or fabricated.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.660
In one passage considered authentic, 
Muhammad is reported to have said:

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:21.720
‘None of you is a believer till I am dearer to him than 
his child, his father and the whole of mankind.’

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:29.120
This stupendous egotism is eerily echoed by the Christian messiah Jesus in Matthew 10:37:

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.860
‘Anyone who loves their father or mother 
more than me is not worthy of me;

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.220
‘anyone who loves their son or daughter
more than me is not worthy of me.’

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.100
So we have Allah, Yahweh, Muhammad and Jesus

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.220
all demanding supremacy over 
every other human relationship.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.620
And we all know the punishments supposedly
awaiting those who don’t comply.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.940
Forget ‘hate speech’. For me, this is
the most dangerous kind of language

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:02.060
— the language of totalitarian ultimatums,
that seeks to conquer by dividing,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:08.620
trying to come between us and our loved ones
in order to achieve total subservience.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.520
My love isn’t to be had for the asking.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:17.740
My love isn’t to be had on the promise of a gift 
that gives nothing but takes endlessly.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:24.840
And my love certainly isn’t to be had 
by anyone who attempts to dictate who I love.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.100
In part two, I’ll be continuing my exploration,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.200
looking at slave mentality, at sacrifice, at shunning

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.400
and at the process of healing from this degrading love.
