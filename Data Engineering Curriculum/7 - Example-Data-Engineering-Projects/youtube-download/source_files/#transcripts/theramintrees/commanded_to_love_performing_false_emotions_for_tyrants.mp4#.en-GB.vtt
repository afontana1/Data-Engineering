00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.660
Escaping personal or ideological abusive environments

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.980
isn't always a straightforward matter of recognising the situation intellectually

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.660
and making a logical exit plan.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.540
Sometimes, rational rocket thrust alone isn't enough.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.900
Our emotions play a huge part in our ability to navigate daily life,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.620
and the distorted emotional responses drilled into us by relentless rehearsal in the abusive environment

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.460
can disrupt our functioning at the most subtle levels.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.260
With this important part of our navigation systems compromised,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.200
simple, everyday interactions can become a minefield

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.560
of self-sabotaging thoughts and conflicted behaviour.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.360
Not only does this work to keep us stuck in our situation,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.720
it can act like a magnet to other abusive individuals and groups.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.540
So, even if we achieve escape velocity from one abusive environment,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.060
we might find ourselves repeatedly pulled into the orbit of new ones.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.840
People who've been subjected to different kinds of abusive environments

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.900
often show highly convergent themes in their descriptions of their experiences.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.500
Years ago, when I began talking in depth

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.480
with people who'd been recruited by religious and pseudoscientific high-control groups,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.660
hearing them recount their experiences was like hearing a gigantic tuning fork resonating at my own pitch.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.220
Their observations about life inside a high-control group

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.420
echoed private observations I'd made about my life inside a narcissistic family.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.000
There was the same divisiveness, where loyalty to the dictatorship

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.580
came before any personal relationship between other members;

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.300
the same social isolation tactics,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.620
trying to sabotage external relationships with friends or lovers,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.020
the same attempts to maintain child-like dependence.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.620
Parallels have repeatedly been noticed between scriptural tales of vengeful, dictatorial gods and abusive relationships,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.280
noting the same threat of dehumanising brutality,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.720
the same capriciousness generating erratic, inconsistent demands.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.680
the same sense of all-pervading invasion into every aspect of the target's life,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.080
with no boundaries and no privacy.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.200
The details of abuse vary from situation to situation, with different levels of intensity or sadism.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.560
but the essential underlying mechanics merge.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.700
At their core, all abusive environments are about gaining coercive control over others.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.860
So, it's not surprising that abusive individuals and groups of all kinds -

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.980
religious, political, academic, familial, romantic -

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.520
converge on the same manipulative tactics to get people to sacrifice their autonomy and authenticity,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.640
and submit to fixed roles.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.320
Not content with controlling their target's actions,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.660
many abusers also seek to dictate to their targets

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.740
how they should feel about their enslavement.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.360
Having had so much of their existence scripted for them,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.120
targets of abuse repeatedly report feeling like actors on a stage,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.040
forced not only to perform tasks,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.140
but to perform characters created for them by their abusers,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.360
who take on the dual role of actor-director in their own production.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.480
And we're not talking Orson Welles.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.000
There's no depth, no emotional insight, no coherent motivation.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.360
Not surprising, when you consider that the actor-director's psychological age is often still in single digits.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.020
Certainly in the case of narcissistic abuse, we're looking at severely arrested development.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.200
Next time you see a child playing with toys, making them say and do things to each other,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.200
take a good look:

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.660
you're watching a model of life with a narcissist.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.520
You're seeing the actor-director inventing characters and motivations,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.840
and controlling relationships.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.980
And, if you analyse the storylines, you'll find a good degree of projection going on.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.820
Children might punish their toys for being naughty, when they've been naughty themselves.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:03.280
In a similar way, adult narcissists repeatedly project their own flaws and transgressions onto their innocent toys: in this case, other human beings.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:11.480
Just like toys, targets are directed to play nonsensical fragmented ciphers with no inner life.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.860
They exist as cartoonish props around the central figure of the abuser,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.980
who often presents as an unappreciated martyr.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:29.760
Just like toys, their single function is to constantly affirm whatever persona their abuser chooses to adopt at any given time.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.080
There might be a succession of different personas, each catering to the abuser's ever-shifting needs.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.880
Each time, history can be reinvented.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.120
Leaders of religious high-control groups will update their old literature,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.980
editing out failed teachings and prophecies,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.420
erasing evidence of past blunders to try and maintain a mask of impenetrable perfection.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.280
Targets are expected to treat the new script as if it always existed.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.480
Fleeting expressions of confusion might be allowed,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.860
if they're swiftly followed by performances of cheerful acceptance when bogus justifications are supplied.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.400
But extended displays of sincere, unresolved confusion aren't tolerated.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.920
Actors who break character unsettle the group and risk ruining the theatrical production.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.080
The targets, being repeatedly forced to perform emotions they don't feel,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.360
or, deny the emotions they *do* feel, is a profoundly self-negating act.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.800
Treating emotions as mere performances to be selected according to whether they please an audience

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.760
is a complete perversion of their function as survival tools

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.480
that help us process our experiences.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.540
The psychological burden of managing this disparity between reality and performance

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.640
can distort and sometimes obliterate our entire emotional landscape.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:05.420
[Music]

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.700
Emotions can feel wildly volatile and overwhelming to very young children.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.040
With the help of healthy reflection, and healthy modeling, they can come to recognise and manage them.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:26.300
Children learn about their feelings when their emotional expressions are consistently and reliably identified

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.720
and, reflected back in the responses of the people around them.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.980
Children also learn by example from seeing the people around them modelling emotional responses appropriate to the situation,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.660
and, resolving them in healthy ways.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.460
We develop volume dials distinguishing different shades of emotional intensity.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:54.620
So, instead of suddenly flipping into immobilising terror in response to everything from mild to extreme threat,

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.040
we respond in proportion to threat,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.380
moving from feeling unsettled, to vigilant, to afraid, to terrified.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.880
We start appreciating emotional combinations,

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.200
like feeling sadness and anger at the same time, or, sadness and joy.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.100
As our emotional vocabulary becomes more nuanced and refined,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.700
our feelings become more closely aligned with our experiences

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.240
which allows us to engage more effectively with the people and situations we encounter,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.620
motivating us to avoid danger, exercise self care, and pursue fulfilling goals.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:39.400
In contrast, children born into abusive environments experience all kinds of emotional neglect and chaos.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:45.500
Their emotional expressions might be habitually ignored, misread, or, punished.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.300
Instead of having their feelings understood and attended to,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.020
young children might be expected to understand and attend to the feelings of their abusers,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.840
who exhibit emotional responses wildly out of sync with the situation.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:05.420
These children are crushed under emotional burdens they're not remotely equipped to handle.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:12.260
Instead of a baseline of emotional neutrality, the child might develop a baseline of active anxiety.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.580
Just a few dominant emotions might be recognised,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.240
while the rest are suppressed or distorted.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.240
If the pursuit of personal happiness is condemned as selfish,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.840
it might become merged with guilt.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.200
If anger is forbidden, the child might substitute anger with tearfulness.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.480
These kinds of distortions can create extreme emotional dysregulation,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.580
and overload the child with unmanageable feelings.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.140
On the flip side, the child might experience a flattening of affect,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.960
where the emotions shut down completely.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.680
The system breaks.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.860
The spark is snuffed out.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:57.660
The individual becomes a cold, analytic spectator, untouched, and unmoved.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.700
All of this turmoil and destruction is invisible to abusers,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.700
who view targets as playthings, and expect instant, fully-formed emotional responses,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.520
tailor made to fit the abuser's own needs.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.880
One of the ironies of coercing targets into performing false emotions

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.140
is that their abusers are often aware that these performances aren't real.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.460
Abusers might lack empathy,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.440
but it doesn't mean they're unable to accurately gauge emotion.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.020
Their lack of empathy just reflects the fact that their targets' emotions only have value

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.320
if they serve the abuser's needs.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.600
Abusers can be extremely perceptive regarding the authenticity of emotion.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.780
picking up on the tiniest conflicting cues.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.680
And targets are often repeatedly tested to assess their authenticity.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.220
Of course, abusers won't tolerate being tested themselves.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.600
If they realise their targets are performing false emotions,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.460
the emotional payoff the abusers are seeking is lost.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.260
They want to eat their cake and have it.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.740
They want to direct someone to feel the specific emotions they decide,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.960
but also want those emotions to be spontaneous and real.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.040
They can't have both.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.880
In trying to have both, they become the source of their own frustration.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.560
Another irony is that of course, these abusers are performing, too.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.660
The perfect image they hope to present to the world is just a cardboard cutout of a functioning adult,

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:38.400
behind which often hides a child, constantly overwhelmed with rage, fear, and shame.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.820
They demand true emotions from others in order to sustain their own false self.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.480
What we have is a process of self replication.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.380
Abusers who are split into an emotionally-dysregulated hidden self,

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.280
and a false-performing self,

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.480
act in such a way as to split the people around them

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.680
into emotionally-dysregulated hidden selves and false-performing selves.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.000
The extent to which targets lose themselves in in their abuser's theatrical production

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.480
will depend on various factors

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.940
including an intensity of abuse,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.280
presence or absence of support,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.220
the resilience and adaptiveness of the target's psychological defences,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.880
and, the ability of targets to fully acknowledge the tyranny in their midst.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:33.220
[Music]

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:41.840
As a young child, every year I'd be asked to sign birthday cards to a mysterious elderly aunt who lived far away.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.240
I never met her, never spoke to her, never saw any photos,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.980
never got any cards in return,

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.940
nothing.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.220
I was just told a few stories by a relative.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.180
For all I knew, she was a piece of fiction.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.360
But, I was repeatedly asked, "Do you love your aunt Julia?"

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.180
If I didn't follow the script and answer, "Yes," faces would drop.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.680
It was a weird and creepy pretence.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.180
How could I love someone I couldn't distinguish from fiction?

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:17.120
Like millions of people, I was directed to perform the same weird and creepy pretence

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.600
of meaningless, unearned love for another figure I never experienced:

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.560
a being called, "God,"

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.780
which, by His nature, was rendered inaccessible.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.800
As with the absent aunt,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.740
I was told stories about this absent "God,"

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.800
but these stories were different:

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.900
started out sweet,

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:43.680
but soon descended into tales of sadistic love tests, genocide, and unending torture.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.740
To recoil from this kind of horror is a healthy response,

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:53.260
but followers are expected to somehow overcome any appropriate feelings of revulsion,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.020
squash them down inside, forget about them,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.620
even feel ashamed for having them.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.760
And instead, magically conjure feelings of love.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:09.900
As a child, I was commanded to love the Biblical tyrant with all my heart, all my soul,

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.460
all my strength, and all my mind.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.220
Unlike the absent aunt,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.760
it was claimed this absent "God" could read my mind,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.700
and judge whether my love was real.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.840
I didn't have a clue how I was supposed to perform this miracle of emotional transubstantiation,

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.580
turning horror into love.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.740
The idea of loving this maniacal figure evoked a sickening, nightmarish feeling,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.980
that I didn't have the vocabulary to describe.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.400
I later found a word for it: masochism.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.180
Not the narrow sense of deriving pleasure from physical pain,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.480
but the broader sense described by German analyst Karen Horney:

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.460
the feeling of being putty in the master's hand,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.920
being devoid of all will, of all power,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.500
of being absolutely subjected to another's domination.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.140
To me, it seemed like death.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:09.800
Catholic nun Mother Teresa explicitly promoted both the narrow and broader senses of masochism.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.760
She repeatedly glorified pain and suffering as divine gifts.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.880
She saw beauty in the misery of the poor,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.340
and encouraged people to view themselves as empty spaces, waiting to be filled.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.080
Savage and callous as these sentiments are,

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:31.580
they express very precisely what it means to fully embrace a capricious tyrannical dictator,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.680
of which the Christian god character Yahweh is a fine example.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.540
It means embracing suffering as eagerly as pleasure.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.120
It means embracing psychological chaos.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.540
Like the god characters of all the Abrahamic religions, Yahweh personifies chaos.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.940
He commands universal peace and love in one breath,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.000
and tribal war and the slaughter of infants in the next.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.300
Targets of mass infanticide include the Midianites and the Babylonians,

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.540
and the people of Jabesh-Gilead, who were punished for refusing to go to war.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.120
He commands people not to test him,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.160
but lavishes favor and status on Gideon,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.000
who tells Yahweh to perform some very specific stunts to prove his power.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.180
Yahweh complies.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.580
He commands devotion,

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.620
but victimises his most devoted followers, like Abraham and Job.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.380
He tortures as casually as he rewards.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.460
Human beings have an extremely hard time dealing with chaos.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.720
We look for order and structure,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.400
for consistent patterns and rules.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.140
These things allow us to figure out how to survive in a given environment.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.860
As children, we're quick to learn the rules of the culture into which we're randomly born,

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.740
however bizarre those rules might be.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.540
But tyrants who constantly change the rules generate chaos.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.540
When the same behaviours are inconsistently rewarded and punished,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.720
we have no way of consistently protecting ourselves.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.180
Whatever we do could backfire on us.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:09.540
In this chaotic environment drive by perpetually-elevated fear and anxiety,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.480
some individuals descend into neurotic thought and behaviour.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.840
Masochists cope with this chaos by giving in to it;

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.960
their self-protective instincts are dulled.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.560
They give up control and autonomy.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.520
and surrender to the tyrant's mayhem.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.360
Of course, because none of the Abrahamic god characters actually manifest themselves,

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.800
all the tyrannical religious mayhem we experience on this planet

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.020
is created exclusively by human beings.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.000
who enact all the chaotic behaviours sanctioned in religious scripture.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.940
The first time I was aware of being in the presence of this kind of masochist was in my teens,

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.960
when my brother and I had a series of weekly discussions with some Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.980
I've never experienced individuals who displayed such highly-scripted behaviour.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.140
Instead of thoughtful, spontaneous reflections,

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.500
they seemed to give fixed, push-button speeches.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.160
When they were taken off script, they often sank into lengthy silences,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.100
before eventually rebooting,

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.060
and pledging to get the answers from their spiritual leaders, called elders.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:21.760
The following week, they'd return, updated with new rehearsed lines to regurgitate.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:28.220
At first, this odd behaviour was amusing, but, it became increasingly disturbing.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.400
They were like shells, with their personalities scooped out,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.660
and replaced with brittle parchment.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.140
I commented later that it was like witnessing the Turing test in reverse.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.020
The Turing test, proposed by computer scientist Alan Turing,

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.920
assesses whether a machine can display intelligence

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.640
indistinguishable from human intelligence,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.800
typically by giving responses that show spontaneity,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:59.100
creativity, flexibility, adaptability, originality.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.780
The JWs automated responses pointed in the opposite direction,

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.960
becoming more indistinguishable from machines.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.780
It was deeply unsettling.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.620
What makes it difficult to empathise with ideological masochists

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.720
is their tendency to pull others down, too.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.840
When I broached the barbarity of the Biblical God,

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.360
one of them, a young woman called Penny,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.560
commented flatly that we were all unworthy sinners who deserved death.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.500
I remember feeling simultaneously sad for her, that she had so little self-worth,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.720
and affronted that she included me in her statement.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.600
Although it wasn't as extreme as the JW's,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.680
in hindsight, I recognised this generalised masochism in my father,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.780
who not only submitted to the chaotic script of my narcissist mother,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.100
but tried to make my brother and I submit to it, too.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.760
Similarly, masochist and abusive social and political groups,

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.840
who degrade themselves to sustain their membership,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.740
might try to drag fellow members and even non-members

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.680
into degradation with them.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.380
This unattractive quality can discourage potential sources of support,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.860
compounding the masochist's isolation.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:20.200
The masochist's response of self-negating submission is just one way of coping with chaos.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.700
There are others.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:29.120
And the ones we adopt play a significant part in determining the kind of roles we take in the tyrant's theater.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:36.180
Self-righteous zealots defend themselves from the tyrant by aligning themselves with it.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.980
Like prisoners play-acting as prison guards,

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.060
they promote themselves to the position of the tyrant's personal mouthpiece,

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.140
and proceed to abuse and dehumanise other people

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.800
with pseudo-divine authority.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.020
While the masochist declares, "we're all worthless,"

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.100
the self-righteous zealot declares, "you're all worthless."

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.720
In the context of abusive families,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.400
this position might manifest as a child who merges with the abusive parent

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.520
and takes on the role of an abusive pseudo-parent towards the other offspring.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.500
Apologists wear rose-tinted glasses.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:19.140
They take refuge in the idea there must be reasonable explanations for the tyrant's destructive acts.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.260
They reframe the tyrant's abuse in various ways.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.800
In religious contexts, they often suggest that acts of divine barbarity

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:34.020
actually represent a divine benevolence so complex we can't understand it.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.980
In high-control groups, abuse by tyrannical leaders

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:43.620
is similarity attributed with a level of enlightenment inaccessible to ordinary members.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:50.580
If profound goodness and wisdom are unworkable suggestions, other excuses are offered.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:57.980
In families, tyrannical abuse might be falsely framed as a spurious physical illness, like dementia,

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.480
absolving the abuser of responsibility.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:08.000
In all cases, apologists, who have no trouble recognising abuse in any other context,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.880
clutch at any straw to prevent themselves recognising abuse from the tyrant.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.980
Sometimes the denial is more immersive.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:22.620
Instead of offering excuses for it, the tyrant's abuse is blocked out altogether.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:28.480
To this day, I continue to receive personal messages from followers of the Abrahamic religions

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.500
who flat-out deny any punitive qualities in the gods of their scriptures.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:41.420
This kind of blanket denial can sometimes result from the maladaptive defence mechanism called "splitting."

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:46.560
Splitting divides unmanageable complexity, contradiction, or chaos

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.060
into simplistic dichotomies:

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.520
positive or negative. right or wrong

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.520
always or never, us or them.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:04.160
Faced with a chaotic tyrant, the negative parts may be blocked out completely, leaving only the positive.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.460
Of course, denial can also arise from simple unawareness and inexperience.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.820
Some people have never investigated the Abrahamic scriptures.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.780
Some have been actively sheltered from their contents.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:22.120
What's clear from all these positions is that none of them have anything to do with love.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.620
What kind of love pushes individuals into maladaptive defence strategies

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.920
designed to clock out unbearable threat?

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.260
What kind of love relies on the perpetual ignorance of atrocities?

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.260
These positions are theatrical roles,

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:43.320
all of which serve the function of affirming, excusing, and enabling the tyrant.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:49.580
With our emotions in healthy working order, rejecting these false roles would be a pretty straightforward matter.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:57.080
We'd experience situationally-appropriate disgust at the scriptural depictions of these divine tyrants.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.420
We'd also feel no fear of them.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.520
We'd recognize they were no more dangerous to us than any other literary tyrant,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.560
from Nurse Ratched to Jame Gumb.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.400
We have no reason to fear being lobotomised on the orders of Nurse Ratched,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.640
or being abducted and skinned by Jame Gumb.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.940
Or, being eternally tortured by any Abrahamic gods.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.300
Literary characters represent no threat,

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.500
and if our emotions were in alignment with our experience,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.240
that's where the story would end.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.100
Religious scriptures would hold the same value to us as any other literary work:

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.220
we'd reflect on the choices of the characters depicted in their stories,

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.700
integrate any useful insights,

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.880
and move on to the next book.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.580
As we do with all other ancient literature,

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:54.560
we'd recognise that any accounts of outlandish transformations and characters with superpowers

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.340
reflected the primitive magical thinking of the time.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.300
But, as followers of Abrahamic religions,

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.920
we have all that crucial context ripped away by our indoctrinators,

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.240
who push our emotions completely out of alignment with our experience

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:16.060
by abusively compelling us to accept their ancient literature as fact.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:24.320
We can imagine the damaging effects of presenting some of our most tragic poetic literature as fact to children.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.580
Violating the important distinction between fantasy and reality

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.020
turns mythical monsters into terrifying threats

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.120
that children are not psychologically equipped to face.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:43.700
But, millions of children are expected to face them with smiles plastered on their faces.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.300
As a child faced with the tyrannical Yahweh character,

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.700
I avoided succumbing to the masochist position

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.440
by immersing myself in denial.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:59.000
In my case, I learned to focus exclusively on Yahweh's human persona, Jesus,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.920
who was presented as an unappreciated martyr.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:08.120
Concentrating on Jesus allowed me to block out Yahweh's atrocities.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.460
In my teens, when I allowed myself to take a good hard look at the Yahweh character,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.560
it became clear there was no supreme intelligence here.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.760
Even by human standards, this was, in every sense -

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.280
morally, intellectually, emotionally -

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.200
an underdeveloped intelligence.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.680
In fact, what came to mind was the character of Charlie X from an old Star Trek adventure.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.880
Charlie X was an alien teenager who tyrannised the crew of the USS Enterprise

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.380
using his psychokinetic powers to disfigure people,

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.860
or even think them out of existence.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.820
One of his victims was a crewmember he became infatuated with,

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.580
who wasn't attracted to him.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.840
Like the Biblical God, Charlie X was a fragile, needy character,

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.720
who commanded love,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.940
expected it to be magically conjured up from nothing by his targets,

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.880
and threatened annihilation if he didn't get it.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.920
Unlike Charlie X, the Biblical God was claimed to be the all-knowing creator;

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.900
an all-knowing creator who didn't know how human emotions like love and trust worked.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.900
Before they could be switched on like a light.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.780
It was too stupid for words.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.080
Love is earned, not commanded,

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:34.080
and, in order to earn it, you have to make an appearance at some point.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.040
Even when it comes to absent humans, like the elusive Aunt Julia,

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.340
to coerce children into performing love they don't feel

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.460
teaches them that their love is not their own to give to the people they choose,

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:53.920
but a mere commodity that others can give away on the children's behalf without consent.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.940
It's no one else's place to dictate to us who to love, or trust,

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.300
or find physically attractive,

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.280
or experience any other feeling for.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.620
We're each the master of our own emotions.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:13.180
[Music]

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.960
In my first few years working as a therapist,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.620
I saw a client who would recount the most horrific experiences

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.780
in a strikingly incongruent singsong voice.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:31.020
Her mother had recently died and she'd come to therapy to address difficulties in the grieving process.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.980
She'd become convinced her mother was haunting her, because whenever she thought about her,

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.900
she'd get the sense of something terrifying looming over her.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.180
Over time, as we explored what this unseen terror might be,

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:49.480
it became clear she had a chronic aversion to expressing anger towards her mother,

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:55.480
who, it gradually emerged, had subjected her to extreme physical and psychological abuse,

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.060
resulting in severe emotional disconnection.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.060
As we worked on her emotional rehabilitation,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.460
there was a breakthrough insight:

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.580
the looming terror wasn't the ghost of her abuser,

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:13.520
but her own suppressed anger, fighting to come to the surface and find expression.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.860
Releasing this pent-up anger for the first time felt frightening, sometimes almost unbearable.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:26.180
But, as she began to let herself feel it, we both noticed the transformative effect:

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:31.040
Her face started to relax from its constant ingratiating smile.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.860
The singsong voice she used to recount her abuse deepened to an adult register.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.320
Several other suppressed emotions emerged,

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.820
including sadness and joy.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:48.020
And, she was finally able to hold her mother to account with genuine emotion.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:55.680
Sometimes it's just a couple of key emotions that are missing and their reemergence can be a catalyst for change.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.380
Another of my therapy clients, who was in an emotionally-abusive marriage,

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.500
would switch between anxiety and depression

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.600
as she described her joyless life of restriction and isolation.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.400
But any attempts to explore ways of stepping outside of the script her husband had handed her

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:17.480
were quickly shut down with excuses and deflections.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.460
This emotional gridlock continued for many weeks,

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.920
until, one session, there was a significant shift.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.040
She expressed annoyance at her husband.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.480
He'd taken her car unexpectedly,

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:36.880
and she'd had to rush to find public transport that would get her to the session in time.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.600
We both recognised his attempt to sabotage her therapy,

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.300
but I reflected that this was the first time I'd seen her express any degree of anger towards him.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.160
It was a pivotal emotional moment.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.500
She spoke about how important therapy had become to her:

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.940
it was one hour in the week that belonged completely to her,

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.160
and it was something she would fight to protect.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.100
Over the following weeks, she began to take her life back.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.460
Sometimes, when emotions come back, we're not ready to feel them.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:16.060
In my teens, after years of religious and family abuse, my long-suppressed anger returned.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.980
Like my aforementioned clients, it played a crucial role in ending my abuse,

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.020
as I finally stood my ground.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:30.360
But I wasn't prepared for the relentless white-hot thoughts and feelings that continued to erupt inside me.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.140
I had no experience with dealing with this kind of anger,

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:38.360
and, no emotional mentors who modeled healthy ways of dealing with it.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.660
So, I dealt with it the way I'd been trained to deal with emotion:

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.580
I blocked it out.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.640
Whenever I felt it rising up inside me, I turned my body to stone.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.820
And, as a result of this perpetual suppression,

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.220
eventually, I turned to stone completely.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.560
All of my emotions, from happiness, to sorrow,

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.800
to fear, to anger,

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.100
faded to indistinguishable grey.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.520
I felt nothing.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.880
And, that's how things stayed for several years.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.400
The irony isn't lost on me that I'd done exactly what my abusers had done:

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.800
I'd forbidden myself to feel.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.560
No surprise that I damaged myself in the process.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.800
It was only in my 20's, years after moving out of the mad house,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.160
that my feelings came back.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.740
Having forgotten what emotion felt like,

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.120
I was unprepared for the intensity of colour they injected.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.020
Experiencing that colour taught me the true value of emotion.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:45.060
Emotion mobilised me, motivated me, protected me, engaged me with the world.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:49.880
Without that spark, I had drifted out of sync with my surroundings.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.820
Trivial choices had become paralysing.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.620
I felt no drive to initiate or sustain action.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.420
I'd just been going through the motions on empty,

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.760
watching my life like a detached spectator.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.700
Finally, I was feeling my life.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.620
Wen my emotions returned, they didn't arrive fully-formed and nuanced.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.360
It was like returning to factory settings.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.300
Just primary and secondary colours.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:22.360
It took time and patience to master them. But this time, I let myself feel everything.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.900
Abusive environments pull our emotions out of alignment with our experience

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.960
by pushing us out of spontaneity and authenticity

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.320
into artificial, theatrical roles, scripted by our abusers.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.700
Reclaiming our lives means throwing the operation into reverse,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.660
dropping our performances,

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:47.140
and moving back into spontaneity and authenticity.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.080
It doesn't require any feats of logical reasoning,

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.000
there are no intellectual conundrums to solve,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.940
it's purely about becoming aware of what we're really feeling

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:02.840
and learning to separate it from various emotional masks we've become accustomed to wearing.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.900
For example, in situations where we feel a desire to please someone,

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.720
we might learn to determine whether our desire is healthy or unhealthy

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.040
by identifying the emotion driving it.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.060
Are we happy to please,

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.360
or anxious to please?

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.260
Kickstarting this emotional rehabilitation can be slow.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.800
For folks who've become substantially disconnected from their emotions,

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.820
it can be a challenge to recognise a specific feeling.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:35.260
Even deciding between the most basic categories of feeling good or feeling bad

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.260
might be a struggle at the start.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.420
But, gradually, our emotional vocabulary expands,

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.220
and our emotions become ever more closely aligned with our experience.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:51.320
Just as they would have done if we'd been raised in psychological health from the start.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.700
It's crucial that targets of abuse allow themselves to feel all of their emotions.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.680
Abusive environments teach us that emotions have to be pleasing

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.320
but emotions aren't there to please people.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.220
Not our abusers, and not ourselves.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:13.420
In good emotional health, we reject the roles of the masochist, who embraces abuse;

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.860
the zealot, who conspires with abusers;

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.400
the apologist, who excuses abuse;

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.000
and the denier, who blocks out abuse.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.880
Instead, we resist abuse.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:29.280
Here, there's no performance, no distortion of reality, no split.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.000
It's a position of congruence and authenticity,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.580
and there's no space for that on the abuser's stage.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.400
When we leave, some of the other actors might leave, too.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.360
It's funny how often we work through these situations thinking we're alone,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.760
only to find that others around us have been wrestling with the same stuff.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:54.480
Sadly, sometimes the actors will stay, and whatever feelings we have about that,

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.120
we need to let ourselves feel them.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:02.220
In many cases, after we've left, something peculiar will happen.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:07.700
Even though we're no longer there, an empty role will be played for us in our absence:

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.040
the role of the scapegoat, or, in religious terms, the apostate.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.580
Without an actor to breathe life into it,

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:21.140
the lines of this ventriloquist dummy villain will be spoken by our abusers.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:25.660
The dialogue will be the same vapid drivel it always was,

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:31.020
the motivations will be just as caricaturish and incoherent, but,

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.440
we'll be enjoying real life somewhere else.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.120
And, with our emotions in good working order,

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:43.900
we won't be wasting our precious time inside any more of these dismal theatrical productions.
