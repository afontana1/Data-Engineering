00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.140
Several people have mailed me recently, sharing
that they're questioning their own religious beliefs.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.060
Some are feeling hollow, some are frustrated,
some are feeling fearful and isolated.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.660
Others are feeling cold and logical,
approaching things analytically.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.240
Reading their different stories, I'm prompted to share
my own transition to atheism with them

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.260
— and whoever else is interested —

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.140
taking into account both the emotional
and the cognitive components of that switch.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.520
So here are two videos, each addressing
one of those aspects

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.140
and using psychological models as frameworks
to contextualise the psychological events involved.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.560
In this video I'm going to explore the cognitive
side of my transition from christian to atheist,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.140
using a concept from person-centered theory
called congruence.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.720
In person-centered theory, the self is sometimes
represented in two components:

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.900
'experience' and something called 'self-structure'.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.480
Experience refers to the bald data
we gather through our five senses,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.740
and from internal and visceral sensations.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.260
Now there's clearly a bewildering volume
of data available to the senses.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.500
Person-centered theory suggests we have to find ways of processing this data

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.380
into manageable, meaningful chunks and patterns

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.080
—&nbsp;and that we do this through our self-structure.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.000
This term refers the mechanisms we use
to categorise and organise our experiences,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.880
to give our world structure —&nbsp;drawing on beliefs,
associations, values, and reasoning.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.620
For simplicity, in this video I'm going
to call this component 'beliefs'.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.880
Person-centered theory suggests that we instinctively
strive to understand the world

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.460
to integrate our beliefs about the world
with our sensory experience of it.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.520
And this overlapping area is called 'congruence'.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.820
A lot of our early organisation of the world
comes through naming experiences in the world:

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.800
fork, water, blue, chair.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.300
Lots of these are essentially neutral.
Others will take on emotional associations.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.320
When we get burned by fire
our senses register pain.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.760
But not all associations are based
on our own experience.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.420
As a child I learned, for instance, that some parts
of the human body were 'rude', even 'bad'.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.620
Did my senses tell me this? No. Other people did.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.860
But why would I take on other people's meanings
and definitions, when it's not my own experience?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.759
Person-centered theory uses the term 'conditions
of worth' to describe the environment in which

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.339
the child learns the behaviours and attitudes
that get rewarded with approval and love,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.560
and the ones that will be punished
with disapproval and rejection.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.840
To fit in, and maintain the approval so essential to its survival,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.500
the child takes on the views of its guardians,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.340
not just as opinions but as absolute truths.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.840
In doing so the child moves away from its own authentic, congruent experience.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.040
And as the child moves out of congruence,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.840
mismatches arise between experience and belief.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.300
Person-centered theory describes
two kinds of mismatch:

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.000
denial and distortion.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.200
These are probably best
demonstrated with stereotypes.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.560
John's been taught that 'all gay men are effeminate'.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.080
This isn't based on reality. But it will now dictate
his mental reality in the following way.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.520
Only effeminate men will
get through that stereotype filter.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.900
John has no concept for masculine gay men,
so when they come along,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.820
he simply fails to register them in his awareness.
This is denial.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.540
But what if a masculine man
openly announces he's gay?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.120
This is a more direct challenge
to John's stereotype — one he can't ignore

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.380
—&nbsp;so instead he twists reality to fit the
stereotype. This is distortion.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.100
Hence, John's false stereotype
continues to feel true to him.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.439
How does all this relate to my religious upbringing
and conversion to atheism?

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.060
As a child I was taught god existed. I accepted
it as truth because others told me it was true.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.640
It wasn't based on any kind of reality
accessible to my own senses.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.060
But it created filters, just like John's gay stereotype

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.960
that would then profoundly affect
what information I was able to let in.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.740
Solid scientific facts that conflicted with my belief
were now denied .... or distorted.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.420
People were distorted.
I was distorted.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.860
As this distorted framework of belief was built up,
I learned to hold incredible dissonances in my head,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.680
so that human morality was completely
flipped on its head when it came to god,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.480
who performed the most appalling acts, punishing all
humankind for the sins of two individuals,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.580
drowning the entire population of the planet
except for Noah and the contents of his ark,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.600
condemning his children to eternal torture in hell.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.120
It all made sense. And even where it hadn't,
I'd learned very early on that it was wrong to say so.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.520
This dangerous-sounding word 'blasphemy' would
be used if I did, and would instantly stop all discussion.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.360
Ironically, what loosened the grip of these
non-indigenous beliefs I was defending,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.560
was when I first attempted to prove them.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.280
A religious education teacher had challenged me
to explain why I believed what I believed.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.260
I talk about thisexperience at greater length
in the accompanying video — 'transition to atheism'.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.540
But basically
when I couldn't come up with any good answers,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.230
I asked the other christians in my life.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.810
I knew the answers had to be good

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.730
and that 'god moves in mysterious ways' and other such
ideas weren't going to impress my teacher,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.010
so — for the first time — I pressed
a lot harder with my questions,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.500
and was far more discriminating about the answers.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.460
I was convinced my fellow christians
would be able to supply the answers.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.620
And I was stunned to find they couldn't.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.020
Having never experienced god myself, my entire
belief hinged on the fact that other people had.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.740
But suddenly I saw how easy it was to explain away
the things they were giving as proof of god.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.240
Things like a sick person getting better after prayer.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.020
Well, some sick people get better. Some don't.
What about the ones who don't?

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.440
'It's just their time to go to heaven.'

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.900
So for people who do get better, it's not
their time to go to heaven? 'That's right.'

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.720
So, if it's already predetermined whether
it's your time or not, why pray at all?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.140
And why claim it was prayer that made them better?
'Er ....'

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.100
The critical thinking I permitted myself, in order to get
the most convincing defences of christianity I could

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.940
allowed me instead to see the truth.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.980
That I was just following people,
who were following other people,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.260
who were following other people,
and so on until who knew when.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.020
None of us trusting in our own
authentic sensory experience,

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.280
but instead trusting in the distortions
implanted in us as children.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.960
As my distortions collapsed,
I was able to let reality in.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.980
I was able to see that it's never wrong to
demand good solid answers

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.400
to questions about anything you're asked to believe.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.020
And if the responses to those good solid questions
are threatening or dissuading in any way,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.240
something's wrong —&nbsp;and we should ask ourselves:

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.680
'What's so fragile that it can't stand up to sustained
scrutiny, and needs threats to protect it?'

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.720
Which seems the more likely candidate to you?

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.130
I was able to see that the concept of hell
is a child's concept of punishment —

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.570
that child-like fear of all-engulfing unimaginable
consequences for doing something wrong.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.110
When we grow up, we realise parents aren't actually
into inflicting

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.970
unimaginable consequences
on their children —&nbsp;for anything.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.070
And if someone does want to torture their children?

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.880
We call them a psychopath. End of.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.430
It's perhaps religion's greatest coup that
it's managed to drive such an efficient wedge

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.370
between a person's own senses and their beliefs.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.250
Since my shift back to greater congruence

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.150
— I've had many theists and supernaturalists
approach to challenge me,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.570
each with their distinct brand of beliefs, but all so far
with one standout aspect in common:

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.970
The requirement that I deny
my own authentic experience.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.440
This is in sharp contrast to science,
which has no need to do this,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.180
In fact, it encourages the opposite.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.260
It values the accessibility of information to everyone
to investigate for themselves, using their own senses.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.020
I actually have no inherent loyalty to the
idea of there being a god or not being a god.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.840
God suddenly pops up, makes an appearance
— then, believe me, I'll believe.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.440
My loyalty is to reality, to reliable evidence, to what
is available, through whatever means, to my senses.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.060
That's what makes me an atheist — nothing else.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:33.260
Yes I know all the stereotypes —&nbsp;all atheists are anti-god, anti-society, rebellious, immoral.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.440
And I believe I've covered stereotypes already.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.960
My atheism is purely about a demand for evidence.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.980
And those who scorn demands for evidence, by the way

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.360
— who scorn 'scepticism' — are being
completely disingenuous.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.060
If someone came along claiming
to be the second coming,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.200
is anyone out there really trying
to say they'd just uncritically accept that?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.480
They wouldn't be at all .... sceptical?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.400
I find it hilarious just how fanatically sceptical
some anti-sceptics get

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.720
in trying to tear down the solid science
that opposes their supernatural beliefs.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.640
We all demand evidence. And that's a good thing.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.540
Reliable evidence is where the circles meet.
Evidence could be seen as a congruence generator.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.880
But not when it's split like this.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.080
We all demand evidence for things we find
hard to believe. Let's go one step further.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.660
Demand evidence for the things
we find easy to believe.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.540
And let's pass on to our children
the very best of our knowledge —

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.780
not the very worst of our unexamined dogmas.
