00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.060
This is the second part of a series

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.010
exploring the findings of the Australian Royal
Commission

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.260
into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.560
In part one I looked at the first of two cases
of abuse

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.770
investigated within the Jehovah’s Witness
organisation

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.520
the case of a woman codenamed BCB

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.629
who was abused by an elder

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.620
a spiritual leader in her congregation.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.040
Chairing the Commission
was Justice Peter McClellan.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.780
Assisting counsel for the Commission
was Angus Stewart QC.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.231
As that case showed, various policies of the
Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.340
combine very effectively to protect child
molesters and silence their targets.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.600
The organisation demands that there are two
or more witnesses

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.500
to the molestation or that the molester confesses

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.280
both of which are highly unlikely.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.200
Those who are found guilty can be disfellowshipped

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.080
a form of excommunication in which individuals

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.960
are shunned by the entire organisation.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.560
But this is also highly unlikely
because molesters are told

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440
if they express repentance

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.480
they’ll simply be reproved:

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.640
their congregation is informed they’ve been
reprimanded

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.700
for an unspecified transgression.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.140
What is highly likely is that abused children

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.350
receiving no justice and faced with continued
exposure to their molester

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.440
will feel driven to leave the organisation.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.020
Unfortunately this can result in them being
shunned.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.820
No provision’s made for individuals who
simply want

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.690
to stop being a Jehovah’s Witness

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.160
but maintain personal relationships with other
members.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.180
They’re not given that choice.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.110
They must remain under the organisation’s
authority

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.140
or ‘disassociate’ themselves and be completely
shunned.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.960
Even if they decide to stay

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.310
abused individuals who develop alcohol, drug
or other related problems

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.780
can find themselves disfellowshipped for that.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.960
The cards are stacked overwhelmingly against
abused children.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.110
But the Commission’s second investigation
into the organisation — the case of BCG

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.040
would uncover evidence of unsuspected new
depths of corruption.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.100
Taking the witness stand, BCG testified to
the following account.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.140
She was born in Brisbane in 1971, the second
oldest of seven children

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.600
with an older sister and two younger sisters.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.850
Her father joined the organisation when she
was very young

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.640
followed by her mother, and became a ministerial
servant

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.610
assisting the elders of his congregation.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.020
He exercised dictatorial control

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.360
forbidding his family from reading non-Jehovah’s
Witness literature

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.220
or associating with non-members.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.880
BCG was baptised at 16.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.660
She was sure the congregation knew about her
father’s violent nature.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.460
He frequently beat her with a leather strap

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.100
and she’d sometimes attend meetings still
bleeding.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.080
She had blurry feelings that he’d abused
her sexually around age five

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.860
and a clear recollection of inappropriate kissing

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.920
and sexual compliments from him in her early teens.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.970
At 17, the abuse escalated when her mother
and siblings

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.800
were away for a fortnight in Brisbane.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.060
Left alone, she was repeatedly assaulted by
her father.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.060
Despite her father threatening to beat her
and kick her out

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.250
if she spoke to anyone without him being present

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.150
BCG eventually approached the wife of an elder
called Kevin Bowditch

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.810
but was told he couldn’t talk to her without
her father present.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.460
Twice, she approached another elder Dino Ali

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.300
a good friend of her father’s.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.080
Despite her obvious distress, again she was
told her father had to be present.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.040
Eventually BCG told the person who would become
her future husband.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.560
He persuaded Ali to meet him and BCG.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.900
She said Ali seemed incensed at her

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.440
and warned her she was making a very serious
allegation.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.360
She said she knew that.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.370
A number of meetings were arranged between
BCG, Ali, Bowditch

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.540
and another elder Ron de Rooy.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.000
She wasn’t told about their purpose.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.240
Again she was met with anger

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.100
and asked highly inappropriate questions like
‘Did you enjoy it?’

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.020
Because the elders were all male and also
her father’s friends

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.100
she was reluctant to give them details and
only answered direct questions.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.360
They instructed her to tell her mother about
the abuse.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.259
When she did, her mother revealed

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.320
that her father had abused her older sister.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.760
BCG asked how she could’ve left her alone
with him.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.420
Her mother said she didn’t think he’d
do it again

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.920
because he was a Jehovah’s Witness.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.020
BCG and her mother then spoke

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.979
to the two youngest daughters around ages
five and seven.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.640
They both reported sexual assaults by their
father.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.840
BCG and her mother told the elders.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.440
But Ron de Rooy told them:

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.199
‘We don’t want to talk to your sisters

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.540
because they are too young to know what they
are talking about’.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.660
The elders said BCG had to put her allegations
to her father.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.159
Terrified, she went ahead for the sake of
her younger sisters.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.240
In the meeting, her father threatened to flog
her, hit her and kill her.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.380
The elders only intervened when he got up
and moved towards her.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.440
Eventually he was disfellowshipped.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.980
But de Rooy told her it wasn’t for abusing her

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.320
but for some other misconduct.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.600
When she asked why, he said they needed two
or more witnesses.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.940
When she mentioned her sisters, he said it
had to be the same event.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.280
Her father appealed his disfellowshipping

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.080
and BCG was called to appear before a judicial panel

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.729
of three elders from other congregations.

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.500
She had to recount her experiences all over again.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.400
But eventually her father confessed
to ‘stepping out of line’.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.540
His appeal was rejected. Eventually he moved
away from the area.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.360
BCG said many congregation members accused
her of lying.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.400
Although she was married later that year

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.219
she felt worthless and alone and attempted
suicide by overdose

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:36.539
an act for which she was later chastised by
de Rooy

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.900
because it was considered a serious transgression
against Jehovah.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.460
A few years later de Rooy informed her

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.650
that her father was being reinstated

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.000
because he was ‘doing all the right things’.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.180
When asked what these right things were

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.160
he said her father was attending meetings.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.660
She reminded him her father was attending
meetings

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.660
when he was abusing her and her sisters.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.939
BCG told de Rooy the congregation wasn’t safe

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:05.809
and she was going to take it to the police.

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:08.800
In response she said he quoted a bible passage

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.360
that forbids taking brothers to court.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.800
And he warned that she could be disfellowshipped

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.040
for bringing reproach on Jehovah.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.260
She wrote to senior officials in the organisation
but no action was taken.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.379
Instead they sent a letter counselling her
to preserve her tears in a skin bottle.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.240
This was a reference to Psalms 56, verse 8

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.920
which depicted the Biblical god collecting
tears in his skin bottle

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.540
and recording them in a book.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.139
After her third son was born, she separated
from her husband

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:45.430
and left the organisation, disillusioned by
its hypocrisy

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.349
and doubting the claim that its senior members
were divinely appointed.

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:53.860
On leaving, she reported her abuse to the police.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.619
Unlike the Jehovah’s Witness organisation

00:07:56.619 --> 00:08:01.529
the secular courts had rules protecting her
from inappropriate questioning.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:05.840
Her father was convicted and given a 3-year
sentence.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.319
Speaking about the police and the Royal Commission
staff

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:13.050
she said she’d had more support, acknowledgement
and acceptance

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.180
from complete strangers than she’d ever
had from her congregation.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.909
And she hoped the Jehovah’s Witness organisation

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:23.819
would be made criminally and financially accountable

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.300
for its failure to protect children.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.860
Dino Ali, an elder for 20 years, was the first

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.780
to be questioned about the BCG case.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.860
He was asked why he’d initially dismissed
her request to talk to him.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.440
Ali embarked on a lengthy defence

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.000
that was conflicted to the point of incoherence.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.899
He claimed absolutely no recollection of the
conversation;

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.340
then declared he would never have told her
to talk to her father first;

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.520
then said there wasn’t enough information

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.760
to comment on whether he would say that;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.660
then he said he wasn’t denying what she’d said.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.080
Finally, in the most strangulated evasion
he said:

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.500
I’m not saying that I’m denying that that’s
something

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.500
that she may have assumed that I said, or
that she said.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.020
Instead of giving up in the face of this protracted
tap-dance

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.560
Judge McClellan continued to pursue a straight
answer.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.760
He established that the organisation requires members

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.500
to first approach those they have a disagreement with.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.380
He then suggested that BCG’s testimony that
Ali told her

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.410
to talk to her father first was consistent
with this teaching.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.860
Finally, after more tap-dancing Ali admitted
the consistency.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.220
It took a staggering eleven and a half minutes

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.300
to push through Ali’s deflections and evasions

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.620
and get that simple acknowledgement.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.360
And that was on an incident he didn’t even recall.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.240
Ali claimed he and the other elders all believed
BCG’s allegations

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.020
but said they couldn’t act on that belief

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.160
without corroboration from another person.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.320
In line with the organisation’s policies

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.400
he said they needed either two witnesses to
the abuse

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.700
or a confession from the perpetrator.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.200
But as the Commission went on to show

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.180
both these requirements were fulfilled.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.310
Ali initially claimed not to recollect the
allegations made by BCG’s younger sisters.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.740
But a document called ‘Notes of investigating
committee’

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.120
was later produced by Stewart.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.090
It had been obtained from the police

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.820
who’d used it in their prosecution of BCG’s father.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.020
It was handwritten by Ali

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.220
and dated at the time of the original meetings with BCG.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.940
In it, Ali noted that BCG’s father had possibly abused

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.500
the two younger daughters as well as the older
daughter at age 2.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.440
Ali further noted that BCG’s father had
admitted

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.560
that all the allegations of molestation were true.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.840
So the elders had multiple witnesses and a
confession.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.700
And yet they did nothing.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.040
Judge McClellan pointed out

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.660
that Ali had previously told him he hadn’t
got a confession.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:14.000
After some flustering, Ali claimed they needed
to make sure the confession was true.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.800
It was incoherent nonsense.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.080
Ali had previously stated that all the elders
believed BCG’s account.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.720
But on receiving a confession that confirmed
the account they already believed

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.020
they were suddenly unwilling to accept the
confession was true?

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:36.020
Ali’s suggestion that confessions need to
be substantiated was shown to be false.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.920
When BCG’s father confessed at his appeal
hearing

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.840
in front of three elders from other congregations,
it was accepted.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.860
Ali’s requirement of further substantiation

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.000
was an unnecessary, cruel and callous imposition

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.690
on an abused individual who had jumped
through hoop after humiliating hoop

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.060
to meet all the organisation’s judicial
requirements.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.420
Like many elders summoned to speak to the
Commission

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.950
Kevin Bowditch showed no great concern

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.440
for the consequences of failing to deal with
molesters.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.660
When questioned about the potential danger

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.770
from a known child molester to the wider community

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.560
including children outside the organisation

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.770
he glibly responded

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.570
‘What ability have we got to protect every
child in Australia?’

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.380
When Stewart gave the obvious answer

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.130
that they could report to the child protection
authorities

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.100
Bowditch said that was done in some cases.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.080
But Stewart put it to him that this wasn’t
a voluntary practice

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.360
it wasn’t done unless there was a legal
requirement to do so.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.180
Bowditch confirmed that was true.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.300
As with virtually all the elders summoned
to testify

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.540
— including Ali —

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.820
Bowditch had declined to watch BCG’s testimony
or read her statement.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.760
Stewart asked why this was. Bowditch claimed
it was because

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.880
he preferred to be truthful and speak from
his own point of view.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.620
When Stewart asked Bowditch why abused individuals

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.560
were required to face their abusers

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.030
Bowditch suggested it could start the healing
process.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.580
He said it was so people like BCG could get
it out

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.120
and tell the person who’d carried out the
vile act.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.240
But in Bowditch’s own statement, he recalled
BCG’s father

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.190
being verbally aggressive and physically threatening
towards his daughter

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.200
who appeared frightened.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.660
There was nothing healing about this atmosphere
of intimidation.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.200
And Bowditch conceded Stewart’s point that
it hadn’t been conducive

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.500
to arriving at the truth.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.620
Even within Jehovah’s Witness literature

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.100
there’s an acknowledgement that, far from
healing

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.490
confrontations can cause more damage and trauma

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.570
sparking denial and more abuse.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.620
The organisation’s literature even acknowledges

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.520
that forgiveness isn’t necessarily appropriate.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.660
The point has to be made that an all-knowing
god would know

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.620
how damaging these confrontations can be for
abused individuals.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:08.220
So who determined that these confrontations
should be judicial procedure?

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.000
Was it a callous incompetent god

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.420
or callous incompetent humans, falsely claiming
to speak for a god?

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.160
Like all his colleagues, Ron de Rooy — an
elder for 29 years

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.280
declined to view BCG’s testimony.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.220
When asked why, he said he didn’t want to
listen to it

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.760
so he could be objective.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.520
He said he wanted to be honest in any questions
that he was asked.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.920
But it later emerged that he had watched
Dino Ali’s testimony

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.880
Stewart asked if he wasn’t concerned that
this would jeopardise his objectivity.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.600
De Rooy replied he wanted to be honest.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.020
So — he avoided BCG’s testimony because
he wanted to be honest

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:59.100
but watched Ali’s testimony because he wanted
to be honest.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.480
It didn’t hang together.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.180
It didn’t go unnoticed that all the elders
had avoided BCG’s testimony

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.140
echoing the real life shunning of ex-members
practiced by the organisation.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.300
One individual who didn’t follow this pattern

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.120
was an ex-Jehovah’s Witness called Monty Baker

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.640
formerly an elder at the congregation to which
BCG’s father eventually moved.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.360
Unlike de Rooy and the other elders

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.320
Baker had followed the proceedings closely,
including BCG’s testimony.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.420
As a result, many old memories came back to him

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.240
prompting him to make several amendments to
his initial statement.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.660
He said he was sure the significance of the occasion

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:44.240
would motivate everyone giving evidence to
be fully clear on every aspect.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.440
De Rooy appeared to have virtually no recollection

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.670
of his part in the elders’ investigation
into BCG’s allegations.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.290
He claimed he couldn’t recall a single detail

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:59.150
of the acts of molestation BCG reported to
him and the elders

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.660
which led to a confusing moment when, some
way into his testimony

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.880
he seemed keen to impress upon the Commission

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.460
that he was sickened by what BCG’s father
did to her.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.800
Stewart asked what sickened him.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:17.260
After some prevarication, he grinned and claimed
he couldn’t remember.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.340
De Rooy’s testimony followed a distinct pattern.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.640
When asked about his involvement in the BCG
investigation

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.860
he claimed no memory.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.560
When confronted with an alleged event that
put him in an especially bad light

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.410
on top of claiming no memory

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.460
he also tried to argue that it couldn’t
have happened.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.240
An example of this was when Stewart read from
BCG’s statement

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.060
that de Rooy had said he didn’t want to
talk to her sisters

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.320
because they were too young to know what they
are talking about.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.400
De Rooy claimed not to recall this.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.400
Stewart asked if he was saying it didn’t happen.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.130
De Rooy evaded the question and instead commented

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.770
that if the elders had known her sisters were
abused too

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.040
that would’ve given them more witnesses
to follow through on.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.929
Stewart then presented
Dino Ali’s own handwritten notes

00:17:04.929 --> 00:17:08.610
confirming that the elders did know about
BCG’s sisters

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.580
and that her father had confessed.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.640
De Rooy then claimed to remember very precisely

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.529
that at the first judicial meeting

00:17:16.529 --> 00:17:20.480
the elders only had BCG’s word against her father.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.589
But this supposed precise memory did nothing

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.459
to erase the hard evidence of Ali’s notes

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:28.809
which supported BCG’s testimony

00:17:28.809 --> 00:17:34.020
that her sisters’ abuse was reported but ignored.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.300
Throughout de Rooy’s testimony, he repeatedly
delivered flippant responses

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.000
with the same bizarre grin.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.320
When Judge McClellan asked him if he thought
it was right that

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.420
after her father was disfellowshipped

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.690
it was BCG who was removed from the family home

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.720
while her abuser remained there

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.760
de Rooy grinned and said if he’d cared about
his daughter

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.890
he would’ve made it a lot easier for her.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:03.340
To expect care from a father who’d beaten
and threatened BCG

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:08.080
and molested all of his daughters was maybe
the clearest mark

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.460
of de Rooy’s total rejection of personal
responsibility.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:18.940
De Rooy’s responses ranged from vague to
garbled to obtuse.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.680
At one point, Stewart put it to him that he
was speaking in riddles.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.060
Reflecting on his conduct at the Commission

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.850
it was sobering to think this individual was
responsible

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.600
for the care of abused children.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.800
Further damning facts about the organisation
emerged

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.500
when some Jehovah’s Witness officials were
brought in

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.380
to explain the organisation’s policies and
procedures.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.500
Rodney Spinks — a Jehovah’s Witness for
over 40 years

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.140
was a senior member of the Service Department

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.460
in the organisation’s Branch Office

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.900
and assisted elders in implementing guidelines

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.780
for handling child abuse allegations.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.460
Vincent Toole — baptised in 1972

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.090
had overseen operations in the Legal Department

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:11.040
of the Branch Office since 2010.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.620
Terrence O’Brien — baptised in 1976

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.010
was the current coordinator

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.940
of the Jehovah’s Witness Australia Branch
Committee.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.040
Spinks was first to give evidence

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.620
and it soon became clear that the organisation’s
documentation

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.510
for handling child abuse allegations was hopelessly
fragmented.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.750
There was no clear, centralised set of guidelines

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.420
that was accessible to all congregants.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.510
Spinks said the guidelines were outlined in
various sources

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.030
including the organisation’s translation
of the Bible;

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.740
a confidential elders’ handbook called ‘Shepherd
the Flock of God’;

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.580
confidential letters sent to the body of elders;

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.520
and articles in the organisation’s magazines,
like The Watchtower.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.100
In one farcical moment, Spinks said he’d
found a document

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.830
showing abused individuals didn’t have to
confront their abusers

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.090
but admitted no one had a copy of the document

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.800
until they found an older member of the department

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.900
who’d photocopied it, reduced it and stuck
it in his book.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.210
Stewart commented that it was like

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.360
trying to put your finger on a ball of mercury:

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.980
just when you think you have it, it pops up
somewhere else.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.900
If senior advisors couldn’t navigate their
own guidelines

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.840
what hope did an abused child have?

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.000
The passive language of the guidelines
also became apparent.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.080
Stewart noted there was no instruction in
the confidential elder’s handbook

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.160
to actively inform congregants of their right
to contact authorities.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.040
Only if the elders were asked, were they to
tell congregants

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.440
it was their personal decision.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.620
This is not the advice of a supportive organisation

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.460
but of one that wants no involvement.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.260
Any abused individual who fails to raise the
subject themselves

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.600
will never get the reassurance that it’s
their right to go to the police.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.740
The end result is that abusers are shielded
from the police.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.540
Stewart highlighted the hypocrisy of this
passive position

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.730
putting it to Spinks that if he saw someone
breaking into a neighbour’s house

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.820
or received reliable information of a murder

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:24.640
he’d immediately report it to the police.
Spinks confirmed he would.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.420
Beyond hypocrisy, Judge McClellan explained
to Spinks

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.520
the potential criminality of not reporting.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.559
If elders determine that an allegation is true

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.110
it ceases to be knowledge of an allegation

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.990
and becomes knowledge or belief of a criminal offence.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.650
In New South Wales, where Spinks was based

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.910
criminal sanctions could be imposed on people

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:53.230
who knew or believed a criminal offence had
been committed and didn’t report.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.740
Stewart further noted that if contacting child
protection authorities

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.660
was an automatic first step

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.750
there’d be no need for elders to interview
the child

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:08.520
elders who, Stewart noted, had no training
in interviewing traumatised children.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.500
Spinks agreed.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.020
McClellan also noted that civil authorities
had the benefit of decades

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.600
of scientific research in the assessment and
treatment of abusers

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.820
none of which was available to the Jehovah’s
Witnesses

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.660
research that underscored the high risk of
re-offending.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.480
But in a jarring moment of defiance

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.320
Spinks had already said the Bible would prevail
over science

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.550
and had proudly cited Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.330
in South Korea, Russia, Azerbaijan and Eritrea

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.240
who’d gone to prison for their beliefs.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.320
He said the organisation would continue to
reprove and reinstate individuals

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.060
who show themselves ‘sufficiently repentant’.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.520
When it was put it him that there was a clear
inducement

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.170
for people to pretend to be repentant if it
meant they avoided punishment

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:03.100
Spinks conceded that was possible.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.740
Vincent Toole admitted to receiving three
or four allegations

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.860
of child sexual abuse every month.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.210
A trained solicitor himself, Toole conceded
no formal training

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.040
was required to be an elder

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.240
even though the position entailed far-reaching
responsibility

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.740
for the welfare of many people.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.820
Toole claimed that before someone was nominated
as an elder

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.980
the organisation would use a formal ‘Working
with Children’ clearance check

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.840
to establish a clean record.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.820
But Stewart noted that such checking systems

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.890
depend on accurate databases of sexual offences.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.410
If the authorities aren’t informed of offences

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.660
then the efficacy of the checking is compromised.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.040
With the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ record of
not reporting offences

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.050
it seemed the organisation wanted to benefit
from this external database

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.660
but not contribute to it.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.100
Toole repeatedly claimed he’d have no hesitation
reporting abuse to the police

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.600
but only if there was no other way to protect
the child.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.720
In practice, this situation is highly unlikely

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.170
because the organisation believes it provides
effective protection

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.100
by moving children out of their homes like
they did with BCG

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.980
in the process, cutting her off from family life.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.740
And indeed, when Toole was asked directly

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.300
whether he’d ever gone to the police he
admitted he hadn’t.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.140
Toole initially claimed the legal department
had been instructed

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.400
to direct elders to clearly tell victims they
have an absolute right

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.180
to report their abuse to authorities.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.440
But when asked to cite these instructions,
he couldn’t.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.340
He scaled down to a lesser claim

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.830
that it was in the spirit of the organisation’s
literature to report

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.820
and admitted he’d received no formal instructions.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.260
Toole played the human rights champion

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.750
repeatedly claiming the organisation’s reluctance

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.630
to contact authorities was about protecting
people’s right to decide

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.160
what was in their own best interests.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.500
But genuine human rights champions inform
people of their rights

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:07.010
because without that awareness, people can’t
exercise their rights.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:12.179
In contrast, Jehovah’s Witness children
have been kept unaware of their rights.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.940
Toole protested that they didn’t live in
a cocoon.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.920
But they do.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.559
The Jehovah’s Witness organisation is a
separatist group

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:26.080
whose literature repeatedly warns against
bad associations with non-members.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.280
Chapter 5 of the organisation’s book ‘Keep
Yourself in God’s Love’

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.220
is explicitly titled ‘How to keep separate
from the world’

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:40.560
and opens with John 15, verse 19: ‘You are
not part of this world.’

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.160
You don’t have to be physically isolated
to be effectively cocooned.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.380
You simply have to be kept in trusting ignorance

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.280
warned against associating with non-members

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.960
and threatened with punishment or even abandonment
for disobedience.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.000
When asked what improvements the Jehovah’s
Witness organisation

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.720
ould make in handling child sexual abuse

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.620
Terrence O’Brien was quite forthcoming.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.340
He said clearer documentation
was needed regarding policy;

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.600
the right to report needed to be clearly explained;

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:17.260
and procedures needed to be clearly explained
to anyone alleging abuse.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.980
One thing O’Brien wasn’t clear on was
protecting the congregation.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.460
McClellan asked how the elders would safeguard
the congregation

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.540
if they fully believed the allegations of
abuse against someone

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.960
but couldn’t meet the organisation’s requirements
for proof

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.000
like the two-witness rule.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.610
O’Brien said the elders would put restrictions

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.020
on that person’s association with children.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.900
When McClellan noted that this depended

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.100
on elders observing the transgression

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.260
O’Brien added that congregants could report
it to them.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.170
But McClellan pointed out that congregants
wouldn’t know to report it

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.240
because they weren’t told about the restrictions.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.100
O’Brien agreed.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.740
The lack of basic thought given to safeguarding
procedures was staggering.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.680
O’Brien ruled out any change regarding the
two-witness rule

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.299
or giving women a role in the investigative
process.

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:12.280
He confirmed the bizarre scriptural reasons

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.630
for forbidding women to exercise authority
over men

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.940
citing 1 Timothy 2.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.260
Reason one: Adam was formed before Eve.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.020
This is a straightforward non sequitur.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:30.120
The birth order of the Bible’s first two
humans has no logical connection

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.780
to the respective attributes of modern men
and women.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.260
Reason two: Adam wasn’t deceived but Eve was.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.980
In fact, according to the Bible, Adam and
Eve both succumbed

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.840
to exactly the same inducement

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.790
being told they wouldn’t die if they ate

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.300
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:55.400
So this second reason is a lie — one for
which female Jehovah’s Witnesses pay.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.380
On the subject of lies, it emerged that O’Brien
had knowingly given

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.260
the Commission false information
about a potential witness.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.580
McClellan had previously enquired about the
possibility of hearing

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.580
from a member of the organisation’s Governing Body

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.480
one Geoffrey Jackson — who was currently
in Australia.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.540
Under instruction from O’Brien

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.419
counsel for the Jehovah’s Witness organisation,
Mr Tokley

00:28:19.419 --> 00:28:23.049
told the Commission that Jackson would probably
not be any assistance

00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:26.620
because his role was confined to translating material.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.500
But in fact as a member of the Governing Body

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.970
Jackson was part of an elite ruling council
of anointed servants

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.020
giving direction to the organisation, approving
publications

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:43.090
and shaping doctrine. And O’Brien knew it.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.690
McClellan took a dim view of this misrepresentation

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.380
and Jackson was summoned.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.220
The subterfuge that surrounded Geoffrey Jackson’s
appearance

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.820
at the Commission would continue into his
testimony

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:04.860
which was full of diversions, evasions, ambiguities
and falsehoods.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.690
He would repeatedly sidestep the point of
a question

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.040
often reinventing the question.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.650
For example, when Judge McClellan asked him

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.309
if there was any Biblical impediment to a
woman

00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:19.049
being appointed to investigate an allegation

00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:21.080
Jackson replied that there was no impediment

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.240
to a woman being involved with the investigation.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.080
He persisted with this particular evasion
ad nauseam

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.630
and only gave a straight answer when eventually
Stewart remarked

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:37.340
that a person making tea during the investigation
is ‘involved’

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.680
the question was about who makes the decision.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.500
Following O’Brien’s lead

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.240
Jackson made several misrepresentations

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.760
about his role in the organisation.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.760
He presented an egalitarian fantasy

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.299
in which Governing Body members viewed themselves

00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:57.809
merely as fellow workers with other Jehovah’s
Witnesses

00:29:57.809 --> 00:29:59.550
and suggested that if the Governing Body

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.860
gave some direction not in harmony with divine word

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.840
it would be picked up on by Jehovah’s Witnesses
worldwide.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.900
In reality, the Governing Body is an authority

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.400
that determines all the organisation’s policies and procedures

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.940
and it expects obedience.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.580
Individuals can be disfellowshipped for disagreeing
with them

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.300
on the charge of causing divisions.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.920
For example, some Jehovah’s Witnesses have called

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.680
for the reform of the doctrine forbidding
blood transfusions.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.600
As reformists have noted, the scripture presented

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.200
in justification of this doctrine explicitly
mentions eating blood.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.460
There is no Biblical concept of transfusions.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:44.620
But for expressing this disagreement, reformists
have been disfellowshipped.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.000
When Stewart asked him if they saw themselves

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.150
as Jehovah’s spokespeople on earth

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.320
Jackson said that would seem quite presumptuous.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.520
But in a 2001 article in the organisation’s
Watchtower magazine

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.970
the Governing Body explicitly argued

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.910
that it wasn’t presumptuous of Jevovah’s
Witnesses

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:07.060
to point out that they alone had the backing
of the Biblical god.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:12.100
Jackson also misrepresented the organisation’s
stance on corporal punishment.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.160
McClellan asked straightforwardly

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.340
if his church accepted
the corporal punishment of children.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.120
Jackson evaded the question

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.440
saying his church expected that parents have
the responsibility

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.470
to discipline and raise their children.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.840
McClellan said that didn’t answer his question
— and repeated it.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.590
After more evasions, Jackson finally said

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.680
the organisation didn’t accept or encourage it.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.309
But the Watchtower magazine explicitly promotes

00:31:39.309 --> 00:31:42.420
both verbal and physical punishment.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.500
An article called ‘Disciplining Children
for Life’

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.840
claims a spanking can be a lifesaver to a child

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.220
and says that beating children with a rod
won’t kill them.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.500
It suggests a rebuke can work for meeker children

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.040
whereas a whipping should discipline more
stubborn children.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:05.000
A 2006 article called ‘Reliable advice for
Raising Children’

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.809
also promotes a combination of the rod and reproof

00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:13.260
charitably noting not all children need physical
punishment.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.640
Returning to the issue of sexual abuse

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:20.460
McClellan asked about the possibility 
of giving women a decision-making role.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:24.680
After some evasion, Jackson confirmed the
organisation’s doctrine

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.570
that only men could be judges

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.320
and claimed this was based on scripture.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.120
But Jackson forgot the prophetess Deborah

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.740
whose story is told in chapter four of the
Bible’s book of Judges.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.400
The book depicts six major and six minor judges.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.600
Deborah was a major judge who made legal decisions.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:50.120
It would seem there is Biblical precedent 
for giving women decision-making roles.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.200
When Stewart put it to him that many females
would feel more comfortable

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.380
speaking to a woman about their abuse

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.540
Jackson rejected the idea.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:02.660
He said unlike what he called ‘your churches’
where people didn’t talk to each other

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.840
Jehovah’s Witness congregations became familiar
and friendly.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.160
Leaving aside his ignorant comment
on the social relationships of other churches

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.320
his argument appeared to be that any abused
female members

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.200
should feel comfortable speaking to the men.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.320
Like the elders testifying before him

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:25.630
he seemed unable to grasp the reality that
many don’t.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.549
Stewart questioned Jackson about disassociation

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:32.820
when individuals state they no longer want
to be known as a Jehovah’s Witness.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:37.160
It’s a course of action many abused individuals
feel driven to take

00:33:37.169 --> 00:33:42.170
when their molesters go unpunished
and remain in their congregations.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.500
The problem is if you disassociate,
you get shunned

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:52.429
so having been abused, you then lose their
entire social network.

00:33:52.429 --> 00:33:55.690
Jackson rejected the idea that people who
no longer wanted

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.510
to be known as a Jehovah Witnesses had to
disassociate.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.680
He said they could choose to simply become
‘inactive’ also known as ‘fading’.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.540
But Stewart noted that inactive members were
still subject

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.800
to the rules and discipline of the organisation.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.840
In a moment of staggering disingenuousness

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.340
Jackson claimed he’d have to check because
it wasn’t his field.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:23.100
Stewart persisted, putting it to Jackson that
there was no middle road

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.680
you were either a member or you weren’t.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.700
If you fade, you’re still subject to the
organisation’s discipline and rules.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.320
Having just claimed it wasn’t his field

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.740
Jackson now confirmed this was true.

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:40.440
Jackson conveniently forgot another fact about
inactive witnesses.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.260
Even though they’re still officially considered
Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.490
in practice, they’re often actively avoided
and excluded by other Witnesses

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:54.380
on the grounds that their lack of activity
makes them a ‘bad association’.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.760
Sometimes there’s little practical difference

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.810
between this exclusion and formal shunning.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.900
Like the elders who testified before him

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.960
Jackson, with his constant evasions and equivocations

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.109
exposed himself as a man of no principle

00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:14.060
unwilling to state the true doctrines of the
organisation.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.860
And this highlighted a particularly damning
hypocrisy.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.820
When molesters escape justice on the grounds

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.490
that neither a second witness or a confession
was produced

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:29.080
the organisation offers abused individuals
the supposed consolation

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.109
that the matter will be left in Jehovah’s hands

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:36.560
the message being that they need to brave
the hardships of this earthly life

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.160
because divine justice will ultimately prevail.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.820
But if Jackson had such conviction in ultimate
divine justice himself

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.200
he’d proclaim his beliefs proudly, braving
any earthly hardships

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:51.640
that resulted from his faith.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.060
Instead, in order to escape earthly criticism

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.820
he takes refuge in misrepresenting his religion

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:04.000
while abused individuals are expected to endure
their suffering.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.100
He is a hypocrite and a coward.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.440
In 2017, eighteen months after the Commission’s
case 29

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.840
explored the Jehovah’s Witness organisation’s
response

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.990
to the abuse of BCB and BCG

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:23.390
the Commission initiated case 54

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:27.980
a follow-up investigation in which Rodney
Spinks and Terrence O’Brien

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.400
were called back to report what progress

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.510
if any had been made by the organisation.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.960
The Commission requested that a Governing
Body member

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.210
be available in person or by video to give
evidence

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.170
in this important follow-up hearing.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.359
The request was denied.

00:36:44.359 --> 00:36:46.619
Despite the extensive time it was given

00:36:46.619 --> 00:36:51.430
the organisation had managed to produce three
meagre documents

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:56.330
including a letter to all elders, and a guide
for the service desk.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.220
Like other procedural documents produced by
the organisation

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:04.730
the service desk guide was inexplicably classified
as strictly confidential;

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.080
not even for the eyes of service desk secretaries.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.550
The cases of BCB and BCG had highlighted the
damage caused

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:16.120
by the organisation’s lack of procedural
transparency.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.280
But Spinks and O’Brien were unable to explain

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.940
why congregation members were still being
kept from information

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.980
about processes that governed their lives.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.260
A third document had been drafted

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.440
just three days before the Commission hearing.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.300
It hadn’t been published or distributed

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.599
and Stewart spotted some obvious flaws

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.720
and significant ambiguities in the text.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.780
Spinks conceded the wording still needed work

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.280
but repeatedly claimed more rigorous practices
were now in place.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.780
When invited to support that claim with documentation

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.430
he admitted he couldn’t.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:58.200
So instead of a public centralised policy
document

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.400
the picture remained fragmented.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.820
Judge McClellan noted that unless their intentions

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.570
were reflected clearly in their policy documents

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:10.260
there was a good chance they’d just fall
backwards.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.100
Predictably, the organisation rejected the
key findings of the Commission.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.600
It continued to demand two witnesses.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.120
It also rejected the possibility of women
having any decision-making role.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.900
And it stood by its practice of shunning abused
individuals

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.140
who felt driven to leave the control of their
congregations

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.920
in order to escape their abusers.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.560
O’Brien continued to assert that it was
their own choice to be shunned.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.430
There was a strong element of stagey performance

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.700
as he defiantly declared that in regard to
the shunning policy,

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.490
Jehovah was their judge;

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.420
Jehovah was their lawgiver;

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.840
Jehovah was their king.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.920
The BCB and BCG hearings

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.680
revealed an organisation with its fingers
firmly in its ears.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:04.880
To expect change to come from within this secretive, deceptive, controlling organisation

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.720
is, I believe, futile.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:11.690
Energies are much better spent, as BCG suggested

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.990
making it financially and criminally accountable

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:18.080
for failing the children in its congregations

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.340
and, like the work of the Australian Royal Commission

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.400
bringing its damaging practices to public attention&nbsp;—

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.100
exposing abuse.
