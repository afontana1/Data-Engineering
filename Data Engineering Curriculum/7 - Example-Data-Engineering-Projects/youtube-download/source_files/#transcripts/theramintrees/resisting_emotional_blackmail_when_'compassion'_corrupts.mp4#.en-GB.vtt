00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.540
Comfort.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.680
What does this word bring to mind for you?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.460
At first glance it might seem a fluffy little concept.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.080
A pleasant feeling of relaxation.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.860
A state of ease.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.360
Peace of mind.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.840
Sounds nice enough —&nbsp;
but not exactly essential to life.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.500
If we dig deeper, we find more potent senses
of the word.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.280
Freedom from pain or constraint.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.660
The easing or alleviation of grief or distress.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.480
It’s in these definitions that the real
value of comfort emerges

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.080
the vital ability to take relief, even for
a moment, from misery.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.240
Even with people we might despise

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.360
seeing a vulnerable human being in torment
can stir

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.680
our most powerful instincts for compassion.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.960
We feel disarmed.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.820
These instincts represent some of our most
humanising qualities

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.650
sometimes melting previous divisions,
dissolving hostilities

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.880
allowing us to connect with each other in
powerfully healing ways.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.580
But these same compassionate instincts

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.700
can also have harmful consequences.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.780
In our attempts to comfort some people

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.360
we sometimes end up
throwing others under the bus.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440
Like when we tell our atheist son
he should keep

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.420
going to church to make his mother happy.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.500
When our daughter discloses her same-sex attraction

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.400
and we command her never to tell her father
to spare his feelings.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.780
When targets decide to go no contact with
their abusers

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.720
and we urge them not to because it’s so cruel.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.320
Sadly many individuals submit to these appeals.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.560
For others who decline to erase themselves

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.979
there are plenty of voices ready

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.540
to try and pile on the emotional blackmail.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.230
For people who’ve been trained to look after
everyone else’s welfare

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.920
sometimes to the total exclusion of their own

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.280
these kinds of emotional blackmail can feel

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.600
extremely difficult and slippery to deal with

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.940
inviting targets to feel guilty and heartless
if they don’t comply.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.480
But none of these supposedly compassionate
appeals stand up.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.180
And when we stand back for a minute and examine
any of them

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.140
their manipulative power evaporates.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.120
Whether we’re a target, a perpetrator or
witness to emotional blackmail

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.459
we all have the capacity to reflect on our choices

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.840
and distance ourselves from this abuse.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.060
Resisting emotional blackmail means becoming

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.799
more discerning in our responses to distress

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.739
and learning that some appeals for personal comfort

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.100
should not be indulged.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.939
Counter-intuitively, this doesn’t mean becoming
less compassionate

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.660
but more compassionate.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.900
And it means recognising the double-edged
nature of emotion

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.300
which can be a valuable friend,
and a terrible enemy.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.640
Emotions play a vital role in navigating life.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.120
Part of that role is providing crucial shortcuts

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.340
in the simple daily dilemmas we encounter.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.600
Individuals who’ve lost emotional response
can become immobilised

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.310
in a nightmare of information processing

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.540
generating endless rational arguments for
different courses of action.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.600
Just choosing a shirt to wear could leave
them overwhelmed.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.340
Emotion short-circuits this rumination.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.980
We choose what feels right.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.440
Social psychologist Robert Zajonc

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.760
challenged popular assumptions of his time

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.430
that emotion only occurred

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.300
after rational information processing had
taken place.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.680
He noted research on preferences, attitudes,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.580
impression formation and decision-making

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.840
suggesting that emotional judgements were
often made

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.800
independently of rational considerations

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.870
made faster than rational considerations

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.760
and made with greater confidence.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.820
Other researchers have supported these observations

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.930
including neuroscientist Antonio Damasio

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.400
who found that our emotional evaluations

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.570
of situations and their outcomes

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.140
play a central role in our decision-making.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.600
Unfortunately, the same simplistic nature
of emotional processing

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.280
that stops us agonising over simple choices
often leaves us

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.060
open to manipulation from emotional appeals

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.280
which encourage us to make uninformed judgements

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.300
on matters that need more serious consideration.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.160
We can end up buying things we don’t want;

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.980
doing unreasonable favours for people;

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.280
condemning the innocent;

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.220
getting preyed on by ideological groups in
the midst of our grief;

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.380
giving abusers that one last chance — again.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.320
Simplistic emotional processing also leads us

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.260
to place quite staggering burdens on others.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.360
When we tell our atheist son

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.140
to keep going to church for his mother’s sake

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.660
or command our daughter to hide

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.200
her same-sex attraction from her father

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.030
or urge targets not to go no contact with
their abusers

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.590
or try to silence accounts of religious abuse

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.420
we might genuinely believe we’re doing something kind

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.860
even performing a humanitarian service.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.740
But it’s just keyhole compassion —

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.040
focusing on one party’s possible distress

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.820
and completely failing to process the experience
of the other party.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.220
Let’s widen the aperture and look at what
we’re really asking.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.500
Here we have individuals
who’ve often had to cope

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.960
with long-term manipulation, abuse and dogma

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.220
grappling with draining levels of shame, anxiety
and neurosis.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.200
Many feel like imposters, unable to fully
receive love

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.050
from the people around them

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.200
disconnected from their lives by pretending to be

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.040
what others expect them to be just to survive.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.480
And now, just as they’re beginning to move

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.010
towards freedom, integrity, truth

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.490
and the restoration of psychological health

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.030
we’re directing them to carry on sacrificing
all of that

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.800
just so other people can
keep some comforting illusions.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.640
Callous as it might seem to casually consign people

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.000
to a lifetime of repression like this

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.680
it’s not always driven by conscious malicious intent.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.540
Often it’s pure laziness.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.140
As the ‘law of less work’ observes

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.100
given the option, we tend to choose
the courses of action

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.640
that require the least effort.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.740
And not just physical effort.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.840
In a 2010 study by Kool and colleagues

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.740
participants showed a significant bias towards

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.400
courses of action that demanded less thinking.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.880
Many studies like this show that, where possible

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.180
humans often try to avoid effortful mental activity.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.200
Keyhole compassion is a hopelessly simplistic

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.370
emotional response to potential conflict

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.620
trying to bypass the complexity

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.760
of having to think, discuss, negotiate and resolve

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.800
and instead just pretend nothing’s different.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.760
In fact keyhole compassion often works against
both parties.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.160
To see why, let’s look at comfort zones.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.200
We could visualise our comfort zone as a circle

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.280
containing all the activities, feelings and ideas

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.080
we feel most at ease with.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.960
Outside that, we have a ring we could label
‘growth’.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.860
This is a less comfortable area we move into

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.000
when we’re stretched by new activities,
feelings and ideas.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.560
Learning new skills.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.640
Working through difficult
but manageable new problems.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.260
By trading some comfort for development

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.900
our central comfort zone expands.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:32.160
Outside this we have another ring we could
label ‘overload’.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.860
Here, the level of challenge starts to become
unmanageable.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.880
We become depleted
and begin to accumulate damage.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.420
To develop ourselves and expand our comfort zone

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.440
we want to be spending significant time in
the growth ring.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.140
We also want to limit the time we spend in overload.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.420
At times of grief and distress

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.320
we might experience extended periods in overload.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.540
And it’s important to recharge with healthy
sources of comfort.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.100
When we try to make our daughter’s sexuality

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.730
a guilty secret kept from her father

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.860
we’re directing her to spend significant
time in overload

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.340
constantly topping up the shame, anxiety and fear

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.000
she yearns to recover from.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.300
But we’re also preventing her father

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.360
from moving out of comfort into growth.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.980
Millions of parents who are initially hostile

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.180
when they find out their offspring
don’t conform

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.040
to some hope or expectation
do come around eventually

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.710
and enjoy a closeness neither party
would’ve imagined.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.190
A closeness based on truth

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.160
not an illusion of closeness based on pretence.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.780
If those parents had been kept in ignorance

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.040
they’d never’ve got to experience that.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.380
Instinctive emotional thinking is great for
quick fixes

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.040
not long-term solutions.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.340
Trying to apply simplistic emotional shortcuts
to complex situations

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.220
can leave us locked in pain and ignorance.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.660
Sometimes an entire group is destroyed in
the process.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.580
Whenever Maeve or Renie fall out of lockstep

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.270
with the personal plans and preferences of
their mother Norma

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.060
she loses it.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.980
Their offences might range from

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.520
not being free for some family event

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.600
to revealing they didn’t plan to have children

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.160
to cutting their hair short.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.820
On good days, Norma might descend

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.880
into displays of wailing distress.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.640
On bad days, she escalates into full-blown
screaming tantrums.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.960
Each time, Norma’s codependent husband Colin
tries to comfort her.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.900
For Colin, who spends most of his home life

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.089
silently blending into the furniture

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:05.930
these incidents are just about the only time
he springs into action.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.390
Often, after Norma eventually calms down

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.380
Colin scolds his daughters for upsetting her.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.840
Sometimes he tells them, ‘You’ve destroyed
your mother!’

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.580
If Colin had stepped out of simplistic emotional
reflex mode

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.580
and into effortful reflective thinking

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.440
things could’ve turned out very differently.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.279
Recognising the long-term damage

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:31.130
his daughters faced without his intervention

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.170
he might’ve formulated strategies

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.370
to defend them against Norma’s abuse

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.520
found ways to support them when they stood
up for themselves.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.050
He could’ve built strong relationships with
them

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:48.500
and cultivated a solidarity that elevated
the whole family.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.680
Whether or not his marriage survived

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.760
he’d still have Maeve and Renie in his life.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.990
Instead, relying on endless emotional quick fixes

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.960
he focused exclusively on comforting Norma.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.200
He declined to defend his daughters

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.850
and crushed their attempts to self-champion

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.800
which just seemed to antagonise Norma.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.339
He tried to train them to be invisible like
him

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.140
in the false hope of an easier life.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.280
In fact things got much worse.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.740
By offering zero pushback, Colin reinforced
Norma’s belief

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.080
that she could do anything without consequence.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.060
Eventually Maeve and Renie will break all
contact with their parents

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.380
leaving Colin to console the monster he helped
to create.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.160
Colin will be mystified by their departure

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.140
and will blame them for destroying the family.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.660
Norma is a squeaky wheel.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.460
The term comes from an old proverb

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.220
‘the squeaky wheel gets the oil’

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.200
or in the US, ‘the grease’.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.060
The message is that people who make the most noise

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.660
often end up getting what they want.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.920
The squeaky wheel could be a parent;

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.820
a child, who gets indulged by parents and siblings;

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.240
an employee in the workplace;

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.740
an ideological group.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.120
In his attempts to comfort Norma

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.620
Colin was certainly trying to alleviate distress.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.900
The pivotal question is: ‘Whose distress?’

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.760
On the surface, it would seem
to be about Norma’s.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.060
In fact it’s all about Colin’s.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.220
Which is the root of this entire mess.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.580
The fact is Colin’s uncomfortable with difficult
feelings.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.080
He’s never learned to deal with them —

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.060
to tolerate them, sit with them, reflect on
what they’re really about.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:49.380
Because of this, his knee-jerk emotional reflex
is to shut them down.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.300
This real-life case illustrates the difference

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.760
between compassion and enabling.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.660
Compassion supports and nurtures healthy development.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.060
It acknowledges the wider context of a situation

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.420
and recognises that comforting interventions

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.220
sometimes have negative consequences

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.140
like obstructing learning, and reducing motivation
to change.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.459
By recognising when to step in and when not
to

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.560
compassion facilitates growth.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:27.900
In contrast, enabling indulges and excuses
unhealthy behaviour.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.400
It focuses on the superficial discomfort of
the moment

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.880
and ignores harmful potential knock-on effects.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.600
As a result, enabling facilitates impoverishment.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.320
By enabling Norma, Colin reinforced

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.060
her dependence, regression and fragility.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.080
The use of emotional blackmail

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.260
also distinguishes compassion
from its corrupted imitator.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.380
When targets of abuse go no contact with malignant
abusers

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.680
some enablers try to shame them

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.890
claiming it’s like going no contact with someone

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.440
because they have cancer —

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.220
punishing someone for being unwell.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.640
This analogy is classic emotional blackmail.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.480
It completely disregards the welfare of targets

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.740
and adds insult to abuse by painting them
as heartless caricatures.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:24.680
Let’s bring the analogy into line with the
reality of the abusive situation.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.060
Imagine that contact with the patient

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.760
sets off an extreme allergic response in the visitor.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.100
Just a word or even a look

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.620
could send the visitor’s immune system
into overdrive

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.760
producing a range of volatile symptoms.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.120
This is what abuse does.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.960
As a legacy of the endless attacks targets
have endured

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.340
their psychological immune systems

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.400
become hyper-responsive around the abuser.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.550
They’ve learned all the little phrases

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.460
and gestures that signify a coming storm.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.200
In response to these stimuli

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.620
the targets’ defences explode into overreaction.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.880
Unlearning these deeply conditioned responses

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.040
can be a tough lengthy process.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.140
Ongoing contact with abusers

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.840
which constantly reactivates these responses

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.940
can sabotage and unravel the target’s recovery.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.160
Going no contact doesn’t just offer a path

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.040
to health for targets but also for abusers.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.240
For some abusers, experiencing the authentic
rejection that results

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.320
from their abusive behaviour motivates them
to seek help.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.160
Protecting them from rejection removes that
motivation.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.880
Compassion allows both parties to choose health.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.580
If abusers refuse it,
their targets are no less free

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.820
to choose health for themselves.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:55.060
In contrast, enabling blocks that choice for
both parties.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.760
If we don’t want to turn ourselves
—&nbsp;or anyone else —

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.269
into human chairs for the indulgence of others

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:04.860
we need to put our brains to work.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.100
We need to shift out of emotional quick-fix
thinking

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.800
and into effortful reflective thinking.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.320
We need to become comfortable with some difficult
feelings.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.940
In particular, we need
to recognise that difficult feelings

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.760
can often be a healthy and vital part of development

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.520
and that trying to shut them down

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.340
can sabotage that development.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.280
Sometimes that sabotage can span generations.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.160
Life is a struggle for every species on the planet.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.730
We’re thrust into a survival situation

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:51.420
in which we face danger, uncertainty and lack
of control.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.280
Humans use a huge range of coping mechanisms

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.420
to get through these challenges.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.440
We use mood-altering substances and activities
as a deflection —

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.820
food, alcohol, drugs, sex,

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.040
immersion in fictitious worlds

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.140
from literature, cinema and television.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.260
Fine in moderation.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.420
Not so fine if they become addictions

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.920
or ways of avoiding impending crises.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.000
Another coping mechanism is magical thinking:

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.059
proposing causal relationships

00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:26.920
between events, processes and entities

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.100
for which there’s no demonstrable connection.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.179
Lindeman and Aarnio described magical thinking

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.400
as ‘ontological confusions’

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.680
between the distinct processes of physics,
biology and psychology.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.020
We might believe inanimate objects have intentions

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.900
or that our thoughts have the power to create
catastrophe.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.720
Research bears out what we might’ve suspected.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.700
Magical thinking peaks when we experience

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.440
danger, uncertainty and lack of control.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.260
When anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.800
studied the inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.600
off the east coast of New Guinea

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.380
he found an interesting disparity in their
fishing practices.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.380
When they fished in the lagoon, they could use

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.400
an easy reliable method of poisoning

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.400
that produced consistently large catches.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.200
In contrast, fishing in the open sea was hazardous

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.820
and there were huge variations in the size
of their catches.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.400
Malinowski noted that with lagoon fishing

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.240
where the fishers could rely
on knowledge and skill

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.330
there was no appeal to magic.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.350
But with open-sea fishing

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.460
where there was danger and uncertainty

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.240
magical rituals were extensively practiced

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.820
to try and secure safety and results.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.640
When we feel a lack of personal control

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.670
we sometimes compensate
by turning to external systems

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.500
that seem to symbolise greater control.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.340
In a 2008 study, Kay and colleagues asked
participants

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.730
to rate the likelihood that some kind of god

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.780
or nonhuman entity existed

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.600
who controlled events in the universe.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.160
Prior to this question

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.500
some participants had been directed to remember

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.480
times in their lives when they felt absolutely
no personal control.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.560
Other participants were told to recall events

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.380
in which they did feel personal control.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.080
Members from the no personal control group

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.710
were much more inclined to endorse

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.580
the existence of a controlling being.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.380
This ties into a vast field of research

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.040
showing how we change our magical ideas

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.240
to meet the psychological needs of the moment.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.840
In times of overwhelming overload

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.100
magical thinking provides a comforting refuge
for some people.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.900
In many cases, the mood-altering effect

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.130
of focusing on a magical idea

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.880
can help some individuals continue to function

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.920
in the most intense part of a crisis

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.200
before coming back down to earth

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.780
and gathering the strength to face reality
at a manageable pace.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.060
The trouble arises&nbsp;when
our use of magical thinking

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.200
opens a door to harm — to others or ourselves.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.700
Like drink and drugs, everything depends on

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.280
the variety you’re using and the quantity
you’re taking.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.580
Wearing what you believe to be lucky underwear

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.700
during an exam might well help you pass.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.100
Not because the underwear has magical properties

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.260
but because your belief lowers your anxiety

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.180
boosts your confidence and enhances your performance.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.919
But that belief becomes harmful if relying
on your underwear

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.360
leads you to neglect your studies.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.740
And the problems multiply when you start

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.200
trying to involve other people.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.780
I grew up with someone who attributed
a seemingly endless list

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.880
of objects with magical significance.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.140
We were all expected to acquire detailed knowledge

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.960
of her boundless magical thinking
and cater to it.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.080
If we didn’t, there were fireworks.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.920
One day in my early teens making hot drinks
in the kitchen

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.760
I was startled by a blood-curdling scream
behind me.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.390
She’d noticed a couple of crossed knives
on the kitchen counter

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.300
which magically signified an argument.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.220
Ironically her nerve-shredding outbursts

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.700
often provoked the very outcome
she magically anticipated.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.400
Sometimes things get more physical.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.040
Many years ago, when my brother opened his
umbrella to dry indoors

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.760
a guest caused a huge scene trying to wrestle
it from him and close it

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.820
based on a magical notion that opening it
would bring bad luck.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.380
I’m pleased to report that this tough twerp

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.260
was swiftly subdued by my brother.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.820
But this is where the trouble starts:

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.840
when the magical thinker’s comfort impinges

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.840
on the comfort of others.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.190
It’s here that we come to a crossroads with paths

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.600
that can lead to antagonism or veer away from it.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.680
Many magical thinkers do veer away from it.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.780
Some choose to listen to people’s valid
objections

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.040
and rethink their ideas.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.580
Others choose to maintain their magical coping
mechanisms

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.220
but keep them confined to their own lives

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.700
without imposing on others.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.840
Both of these roads offer the possibility
of peaceful coexistence

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.820
in which no one’s comfort eclipses another’s.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.800
But they also require some effortful reflection.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.060
And unfortunately, our lazy brains often accelerate us

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.740
straight ahead into conflict.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.480
As Robert Zajonc noted, emotional judgements
are often made

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.160
with great confidence without rational processing.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.080
He also noted that once those judgements are made

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.620
we often defend them with rationalisations.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.980
This might feel like rational processing

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.380
but its goal is very different.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.440
Rational processing looks for answers.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.260
Rationalising looks for justifications.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.180
It’s another kind of keyhole thinking.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.020
We hunt for plausible-sounding arguments

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.830
in favour of our emotional judgements

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.830
and stop when we find them

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.000
blocking out valid arguments against.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.380
When we try to force
our magical coping mechanisms on others

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.660
it would be great if the pushback we receive

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.620
prompted some reflection on our part.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.960
Instead, we often just build walls

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:25.040
of fallacious rationalisations to justify
our imposition.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.380
In our efforts to fend off critics

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:31.260
we misattribute them with imaginary malicious
motives

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.220
allowing us to personally attack them without
compunction.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.380
We might even claim their objections are a sign

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.940
that they’re under the thrall of magical beings

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.760
invalidating their autonomy.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.800
Convinced of the truth of our magical coping
mechanism

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.060
we rationalise that it’s ok to gag our critics

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.580
by making the questioning of our magical thinking
a social taboo.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.559
We rationalise the abuse of child indoctrination

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:59.190
forcing powerless unsuspecting children

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.640
to accept our illusions as indisputable truth.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.320
This abuse is passed down the generations.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.680
We rationalise that we’re justified in punishing
disbelief

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.140
with a range of penalties up to and including
state-sanctioned murder.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.740
So children who never got
the choice not to join

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.260
never get the choice to leave.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.720
Each generation shackles the minds of the
next

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.539
in inescapable service
to the magical coping mechanism

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.540
of a long-dead ancestor.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.840
Not content with earthly punishments

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.120
we invent magical dangers.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.120
We torment our imaginations

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.940
with new punishments of incomprehensible scale.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.100
Realms of perpetual torture

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:48.120
where bodies are boiled,
burned and stripped of flesh

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:54.440
then restored only to experience the same
all over again&nbsp;forever.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:00.300
We rationalise this psychopathic sadism by
calling it justice.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.280
By inventing these realms we create unrivalled
nightmares

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.000
demanding unprecedented levels of comfort.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.340
Let’s reflect on the bizarre corner we’ve
just painted ourselves into.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.300
We now have to comfort ourselves

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.880
against a magical danger that we dreamt up

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.240
to comfort ourselves against real danger.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.420
Even if the real danger subsides

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:30.300
we’re now stuck in a self-reinforcing danger-comfort
cycle of our own making.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.360
Even superficially positive elements

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.160
of a magical coping mechanism can create conflict.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.960
The promise of a members-only magical afterlife
paradise

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.440
motivates us to impose ourselves on others

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.240
—&nbsp;especially loved ones —

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.880
in the belief we’re saving them.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.920
When our loved ones don’t comply

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.500
we might blame them for our distress.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.320
If we stepped back from our rationalisations

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.080
we might realise we’re the one causing the distress.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.960
We’re operating a one-way system

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.400
expecting to be heard but declining to listen;

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.840
expecting our needs to be met

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.760
but not giving a thought to anyone else’s.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.520
These one-way systems tend to end one way:

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.400
in pain and ignorance.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.590
Our freedom to cope in our own way
with life’s ordeals ends

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.230
when our coping mechanisms become an added ordeal

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.100
for other people to cope with.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.040
At that point

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.480
it’s no longer just a source of comfort
for the individual

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.059
but a source of oppression for the people
around them.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.600
Then it’s time for pushback.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.660
So long as any group continues to rationalise
behaviour

00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:44.360
that obstructs and violates the liberties
and entitlements of others

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.760
conflict remains inevitable.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.940
And no lazy emotional shortcuts
will magic it away.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.680
Ex-theists who speak out
against religious abuse

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.010
have often gone through sustained periods
of debilitating overload

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.500
to finally break free of their indoctrination.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:10.700
In abusive religious groups the gap between
comfort and overload is wafer thin.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.300
Step outside the confines
of the predesignated comfort area

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.120
and you’re the enemy.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.220
It can be a gruelling process

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.560
pushing through the wall of rationalisations

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.460
they were often born behind

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.260
and building a space in between these extremes

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.760
where growth feels manageable.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.900
And even after this

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.920
ex-theists from some of the more extreme groups

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.520
face continuing overload
when they share their stories

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.740
working to make an easier departure for others
who are still trapped inside.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:47.680
For their efforts, they’re relentlessly
hounded, marginalised and censored.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.460
In some countries, killed.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.919
The contrast between
this genuine risk-taking compassion

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:01.400
and the artificial product used in emotional
blackmail couldn’t be clearer.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.360
Humans have found many ways of coping with
life’s challenges.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.600
A final one worth mentioning is of course
rational effortful thinking.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.160
With this strategy we can directly address

00:29:13.169 --> 00:29:16.070
many of the ordeals in life that we fend off

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:20.240
with mood-altering substances
and magical thinking.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.900
We can reduce uncertainty
through disciplined investigation.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.580
We can overcome complex dangers

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.950
by methodically analysing their nature

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.080
and creating effective countermeasures.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.580
Mindful reflection can also help us

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.320
come to terms with areas we can’t control;

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.440
to work through false hope

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.980
and refocus our attention
onto more productive areas.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.460
Effortful thinking helps to us change the
things we can change

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.560
and to accept the things we can’t.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.620
Think what could happen if we used it just
a little more often.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:04.440
Humans often rely on snap instinctive simplistic
emotional judgements.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.780
That’s fine if you’re choosing a shirt.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:12.180
Not if you’re processing complex situations
with significant consequences.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:18.100
Emotional blackmail urges us to take mental
shortcuts that work against us.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.960
Notice when you’re being directed to look
with emotional eyes

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.290
at just one part of the picture.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:27.520
Get into the habit of widening the aperture.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.440
Don’t be rushed.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.200
Take your sweet time.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.799
Getting comfortable with difficult feelings

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.480
helps us move away
from enabling unhealthy behaviour

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.940
and towards compassion that encourages
health and growth.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.960
If some people choose sickness and stagnation

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.800
we have no obligation to join them.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.500
Compassion involves thinking about others

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.060
as well as ourselves —&nbsp;not instead of.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.240
Rationalisations might have the feel of rational
processing

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:05.260
but their single-minded focus is justification,
not investigation.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.760
Some emotional blackmailers are amenable to
rational reflection.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.080
Others in the grip of powerful rationalisations

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.220
might be beyond reasonable reach.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.840
Every attempt to restore clarity just gets
clouded over.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:26.280
It’s important not to get sidetracked into
endless unproductive exchanges.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:32.700
Thankfully, it only takes one rational party
to end emotional blackmail.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.080
I’d like to end with some hypotheticals.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.840
How would you respond to the following situations?

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.520
A religious leader justifies child indoctrination

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.380
on the grounds that his group is entitled

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.580
to ensure the survival of its beliefs.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.120
A mother tells her offspring

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.809
they have to make
allowances for their father —

00:31:53.809 --> 00:31:58.000
he hasn’t got their emotional control.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.660
If you can identify the problems with these

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.580
you’re already&nbsp;resisting emotional blackmail.
