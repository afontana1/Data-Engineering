00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.130
[music]

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.720
It's sometimes put to me that my work is mono-focused on religion.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.289
I say look at the cloud behind that cloud.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.480
My driving interest is psychology --

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.319
particularly issues around manipulation.

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.390
Religion crops up so much of the time

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.009
purely because it constitutes arguably the most systematic implementation of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.980
psychological manipulation we're likely to encounter in our lives.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.070
It's a smorgasbord of exploitation

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.730
but it's far from unique.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.860
Here's another one:

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.090
pseudoscience -- systems of belief and practice falsely presented as fruits

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.700
of scientific method.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.380
Like clouds, religion and pseudoscience can drift into each other.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.060
But generally-speaking, there's no requirement in pseudoscience to believe

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.190
in any gods.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.700
Nonetheless, the social and psychological parallels are remarkable.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.630
Like religion,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.550
pseudoscience offers the false promise of easy answers to complex questions,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.600
through unsubstantiated claims of esoteric knowledge.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.870
Like religion, its proponents deflect criticism with all the same

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.080
fallacious defences.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.740
Most ironic of all are the defences that denounce science,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.909
when pseudoscience itself seeks recognition based on claims of evidence.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.140
And like religion,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.560
pseudoscience also shines a torch on the tremendous difficulties we have

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.700
in acknowledging our ignorance and vulnerability.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.440
When we look at the areas of life occupied by pseudoscience,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.670
it should come as no great surprise that it's all the same territory occupied

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.710
by gods --

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890
ie the gaps in our knowledge.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.439
We find pseudoscience mapping out false futures through prophecy;

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.950
proposing false communion with the heavens;

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.140
we find it offering false hope to the sick;&nbsp;and grinding out an endless stream of

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.060
false psychological gurus.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.600
If we take a closer look at those gurus, we see that, just like religion,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.399
pseudoscience can be also practiced by true believers,

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.990
genuinely convinced of the validity of their work,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.360
or by non-believers —&nbsp;people acting for personal gain

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.510
who have no belief in what they preach.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.869
As with religion, these populations can migrate either way,

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.090
with some non-believers coming to believe their own publicity,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.580
and some true believers

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.860
waking up from their illusions, only to discover they don't have skills in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.839
any other trade,

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.239
leading them to continue in a profession they privately reject.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.950
A religious example of this is the clergy project --

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.329
an online community of priests who hold no supernatural belief,

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.260
and whose membership ballooned from around 50 in March 2011

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.700
to over 400

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 in March 2013.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.030
Pseudoscience comes in two broad categories, which we might call kiwis

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.239
and chickens.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.370
As the name suggests,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.279
kiwis are totally flightless.

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:50.780
They provide no results,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.709
no evidence,

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.150
no testable theory.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.440
Typically, phrases like 'vibrations'

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.730
and 'cosmic harmonics' get bandied about, with requests for practical definitions

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.129
or these terms leading only to 'ignotum per ignotius' responses --

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.969
ie explanations even more obscure than the thing they purport to explain.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.620
Examples of kiwis include Crystal Healing,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.749
Homeopathy,

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:12.550
Reiki,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.569
Feng Shui

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.019
and Astrology.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.770
Kiwis serve as armchair pseudo-entertainment,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.909
or as window-dressing to cash in on the placebo effect.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.909
Then we have chickens --&nbsp;concepts that can take flight for short distances,

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.010
with great flapping. This type contains some vestige of workable material,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.290
whether by design or happenstance. But it's weighed down by a lack of rigour,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.840
an indifference to validity,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.179
the introduction of insupportable elements,

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.859
and the corruption of any reasonable components — for instance, when metaphor gets

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:41.860
taken literally,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.989
or when phenomena that occur in some cases

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.530
are overgeneralised to all cases, such as treating all illness as psychological

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.430
in origin.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.939
An example of a chicken would be Scientology,

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.200
which employs lie-detector-like technology called e-meters

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.510
that pick up subjects' physical reactions during explorations of memories

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.799
and associations.

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.359
These sessions are called 'auditing',

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.239
and emotional responses show up as various swings of the e-meter needle --

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.079
the goal being to nullify traumatic responses.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.760
There are echoes of other therapeutic practices here --

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.479
after all,

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.399
therapy often involves the revisiting of painful memories. Phobia treatments

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.620
in particular involve sustained psychological confrontation with

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.560
feared subject matter,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.010
until the fear reaction dies away. But Scientology's chicken status is betrayed

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.550
by its underlying theory.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.490
Scientology founder Lafayette Ron Hubbard asserted that the human mind was plagued

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.750
with 'engrams'.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.100
These are mental recordings of past traumas, purportedly made when we're unconscious.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.090
Hubbard claimed that, during this downtime, we continue to process

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.060
every sensation around us, to the last detail. Hubbard claimed these

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.069
unconsciously recorded 'engrams' are the source of our irrationality.

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.400
The aim of auditing is to rid people of all their 'engrams',

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.259
at which point they're said to achieve a state of 'clear',

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.439
and to possess formidable mental faculties --however, this might

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.410
take some time,

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.419
as the individual's whole existence is explored.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.710
Birth itself is considered an 'engram',

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.990
which is why Hubbard advocated silent birth .... but it stretches

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.280
back further. Events before birth can generate 'engrams'.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.429
And even events before conception.

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:10.349
Hubbard spoke of

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.309
'sperm dreams' --&nbsp;memories recorded when the individual was a sperm.

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:17.369
Hubbard failed to provide any explanation of how a brainless gamete

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:21.309
can perform the sophisticated cognition of recognising itself as a sperm,

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.360
let alone record its experience in memory.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.439
But we're soon drifting back further,

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.729
into past lives.

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.330
And not just human lives.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.210
Hubbard's medical officer Jim Dincalci recalled a drug-fuelled session

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.380
where Hubbard fed amphetamines to his son to the point where he claimed

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.970
to have regressed

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.310
to a clam.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.430
Should you have the time and money to audit these prolific 'engrams' to

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.740
the state of 'clear',

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.550
you'll then move on to auditing immortal alien spirits known as

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.790
'body thetans', which Hubbard claimed are stuck to us in clusters,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.839
and keep us from our full potential.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.310
From alien spirits to past lives

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.650
to sperm dreams to detailed unconscious recordings,

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.400
none of these concepts bear even a postcard relationship to science,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.240
despite Hubbard's frequent non-specific reference to 'laboratory evidence'.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.280
Pseudoscience seems

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.280
irresistibly drawn to the concept of 'the unconscious'.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.780
I'm not a fan of the term.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.049
I prefer to talk about 'things we do outside of our awareness'.

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:16.419
This puts the focus on the things we do, which anchors discussion in

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:17.430
observable material.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.909
When we start talking about 'the unconscious', and speculating on what

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:21.900
'it's trying to tell us',

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.550
we're already starting with a dubious, assumption-laden metaphor.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.330
And in the undisciplined hands of pseudoscientists,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.360
this unanchored foundation is liable to drift clean away into

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.930
unadulterated fantasy --

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.719
taking the client with it.

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:38.929
During her therapy, Nadean Cool, from Wisconsin,

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:41.550
became convinced she'd been in a satanic cult,

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.490
eaten babies, been raped,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.119
and had sex with animals.

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:48.219
She came to believe she'd developed over 120 personalities,

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:49.999
including children, angels,

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.360
the bride of Satan,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.560
and a duck.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.469
She was hospitalised over 30 times because of extreme suicidal feelings

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:00.309
brought about by the thoughts and images generated in her therapy.

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:04.379
She also confronted her father with accusations of satanic abuse inspired by

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:05.300
her therapist,

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.660
Kenneth Olson.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.499
Any chance of future reconciliation vanished a week later,

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:11.569
when her father died of a heart attack.

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:13.360
In March 1997,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.369
Nadean won a $2.4 million settlement against Olson.

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:20.940
As a result of the trial, several other former patients came forward,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.580
with matching implanted fantasies.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.900
'The unconscious' was an exalted entity in the pseudoscience I found myself immersed in

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.669
on a recent course.

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:30.719
As I've indicated,

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:33.039
psychology's been a driving interest of mine.

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.050
I took it up academically at school --

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.990
and pursued it at university.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.469
After my degree, alongside a career in publishing,

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:42.560
I continued my training, taking courses and workshops,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.360
which culminated in a final post-grad course, through which I qualified as a

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.999
therapist several years ago.

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:51.229
The staff were passionate about evidence and research,

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:54.610
Then, a few months ago, I felt like stretching myself, and applied to

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.750
what appeared to be another great course, offering seminars on a huge range

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.770
of subjects.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.750
The course began with a module presented as 'developmental psychology'.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.520
I looked forward to discussing some juicy research papers. Instead, we were fed a welter of

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.479
undisciplined hunch and assumption,

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.779
on subjects like what the fetus was thinking in utero.

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:15.990
The nadir of that particular discourse came when it was suggested that

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.740
consciousness

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.629
began at conception.

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:20.720
The speculations on the baby's mental life

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.080
got truly bizarre.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.710
I'd highlight particularly egregious passages from the course literature

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.380
to read out loud in the seminars.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.780
For instance, this gem,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.509
commenting on the moment babies discover their parents have a

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:32.730
separate relationship.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.130
'An early realisation of the parents' independent relationship is experienced

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.740
by the baby as a gigantic combined figure,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.110
penis joined with breast,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.190
stomach, mouth or vagina in endless
mutual gratification,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.600
creating ever new riches in the form of

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.080
faeces babies.'

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.850
After reading out that passage,

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.880
I said, 'Now, far be it from me to throw out the faeces baby with the bath water --

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.990
but what a load of shit.'

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.410
But the staff member we were with had drifted into a reverie of admiration,

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.260
remarking on the 'wonderfully rich language'.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.660
As befits a chicken,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.230
there were islands of supportable concepts.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.600
Defences, for instance, represent entirely observable behaviours.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.350
We can see people 'splitting' experience into false dichotomies of

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.360
black or white, saints or sinners,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.880
virgins or whores,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.040
heaven or hell.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.600
We can see people 'displacing' onto more acceptable targets.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.450
The late Christopher Hitchens observed another common defence:

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.730
'reaction formation' --

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.629
as demonstrated in the almost clockwork regularity with which anti-homosexual

00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:36.820
polemicists get discovered in flagrante delicto.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.940
Models were also offered that acknowledge how we re-enact in therapy our behaviours

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.510
outside it.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.800
Again, no problem. Well, it's a bit obvious isn't it?

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.490
Client complains that people always let him down.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.820
It becomes clear they 'let him down' because he asks unreasonable favours.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.140
Requests to borrow unfeasible amounts of cash,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.620
r drive him to the airport right that second.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.470
Am I surprised when I start 'letting him down' too? No.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.810
It's one of the games he plays with people --

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.800
and chances are he'll play it with me.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.890
Concepts like these are observable.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.970
But pseudoscientists aren't satisfied confining themselves to the observable.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:13.940
Like Icarus,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.730
they try to fly higher than their false
wings will take them --

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.620
in this case,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:24.620
wings of intuition. And like Icarus, the result is a big burned bird.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.690
Throughout the course, as with all pseudoscientific enterprises,

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.030
there was no interest in criteria for establishing validity.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.040
Instead, it was suggested that we should simply stick with the ideas

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.630
we personally liked.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.460
Me and another student from a scientific background were

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.200
very outspoken in our criticisms.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.230
But, in contrast to previous courses,

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.350
criticism wasn't welcome.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.220
As is characteristic of pseudoscientific practitioners,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.040
instead of engaging with criticism, course leaders sidestepped it,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.139
became defensive,

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:01.010
dejected,

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.960
passive aggressive and resorted to personal putdowns.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.400
In response to my criticisms of Jung's coincidence-denying concept

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.080
of 'synchronicity', rather than address the content of my comment,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.130
one course leader told me I should be more open-minded.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.800
I replied that having an open mind meant being willing to hear new ideas,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.200
not having to accept them.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.180
I said the mind shouldn't be like a bucket —&nbsp;letting everything in without

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.580
discrimination.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.110
That was gullibility.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.819
It should be like a sieve —&nbsp;applying a critical filter to what we're told,

00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:32.360
and rejecting what unjustified.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.520
After a pseudo-thoughtful pause,

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.040
the course leader cheerfully announced that she was a bucket.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.430
It was an asinine response.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.140
It was also untrue,

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.080
as she proved countless times.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.730
For instance, she was pseudo-analysing me one time,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.420
and I happened to cough.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.509
She pounced on it,

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:51.670
saying her comments had clearly touched on something.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.660
I pointed out that,

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.180
as she well knew,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.550
I'd had a chest infection for five weeks.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.540
But she'd already formed a theory about this cough that confirmed

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.110
her analysis, and wouldn't entertain any other explanation.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.400
Had she been the bucket she claimed to be, she would've been able to hear

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.780
other explanations. She was worse than a bucket.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.270
She exemplified another defining feature of pseudoscience:

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.340
rampant confirmation bias.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.960
In his famous paper 'On being sane in insane places',

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.010
Rosenhan showed the damaging effects of confirmation bias in

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.280
psychological assessments.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.460
He organised the admission of eight fake patients into 12 different

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.949
psychiatric hospitals.

00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:31.330
On arriving, they complained of hearing voices, which seemed to say the words:

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.500
'empty',

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.820
'hollow' and 'thud'.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.640
That's all.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.800
They gave genuine accounts of their life histories,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.680
changing only their names and professions.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.180
Upon admission, they ceased reporting any abnormal symptoms,

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.559
and behaved on the wards as they normally would.

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.940
They followed instructions --

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.540
but didn't ingest any medicine --

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.220
and they engaged in conversation and journal-writing,

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.360
to pass the time on wards where there was little to do.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.189
In 11 out of 12 cases,

00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:57.690
subjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.020
Rosenhan noted that the fake patients' life histories were distorted

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.470
by the staff to fit popular ideas about schizophrenic onset.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.640
Normal negative reactions to mistreatment by staff were taken as

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.910
manifestations of disturbance.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.110
With three patients, even their journal writing was pathologised.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.630
Rosenhan also observed that just sitting outside a cafeteria

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.110
a short while before it was due to open

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.109
was diagnosed by one practitioner as indicating

00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:23.450
'oral-acquisitive pathology'.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.290
The pseudoscience institute I attended was rife with these

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.330
pathologising biasses.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.170
Mistreatment by staff was consistently deflected back on the students with

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.390
pseudo-analytical nonsense.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.540
When I complained to the heads of the institute about one staff member's

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.360
serious violation of ethical guidelines, they suggested my problem with her was that

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.260
she reminded me of someone else --

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.190
possibly my mother?

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.480
I couldn't quite believe the clichéd drivel I was hearing.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.290
I said, 'I'm sure if I came over there and slapped you round the face,

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.320
we could have a fascinating discussion about the people I remind you of --

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.710
but the fact would remain

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.820
I slapped you round the face.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.980
Just like the fact remains that that staff member violated ethical guidelines.'

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.440
I could appreciate why most students became apathetic about challenging

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.740
these deflections -- it's hard to convey the sheer volume of them,

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.120
or the sheer stubbornness of the staff.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.920
But I resolved to bulldoze through every deflection that came my way.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.630
Predictably, resistance increased at first.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.670
At times I'd have three staff members firing interpretations at me all at once.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.680
But over time,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.640
resistance slackened as I made it clear I wouldn't be sidetracked.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.530
Of the many instances of abuse I witnessed and experienced,

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.710
the stand-out conflict was a series of exchanges I had with a supervisor about my throat.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.389
Last year, in part one of my miniseries on death,

00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:42.950
I shared that I had a throat problem which was initially suspected to be cancer,

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.610
but found to be benign.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.720
The condition means my voice gets tired faster than it used to,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.189
and with prolonged use over the day, it can become uncomfortable,

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:52.480
then painful.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.790
I've learned to cope by taking periods of rest and just not overdoing it.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.870
When I shared this information at the institute,

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.160
to my bewilderment,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.600
one of the course supervisors deliberately pushed me to do quantities of

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.730
sustained reading in her session

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.010
that I'd indicated were

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.500
out of the question.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.380
Our exchanges fell into a pattern.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.979
I would decline to read.

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:15.949
She would become insistent and argumentative until I got angry

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:18.220
and shut the interaction down.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.240
Incredibly,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.150
the very same thing would happen next time.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.940
I got in touch with the accrediting body of the course,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.819
who were appalled

00:15:25.819 --> 00:15:28.450
and told me her behaviour was not only unethical,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.610
but illegal.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.360
Professional or educational institutes are legally obliged to make

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.710
what are technically termed 'reasonable adjustments' to accommodate

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.930
any physical incapacity that prohibits certain activities.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.870
In my case, that simply meant someone else reads.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.920
More to the point,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.379
pressurising me to read

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:48.520
could be construed as harassment.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.650
I took this to the heads of the institute.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.500
They fumbled a meek defence that my supervisor had interpreted my throat condition

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.530
as a psychological condition --

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.830
a manifestation of some unconscious anxiety.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.309
I said that was completely unacceptable!

00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:04.100
I'd made it absolutely clear to her

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.880
that it was a diagnosed condition, for which I'd had extensive tests.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.180
I said, I hadn't asked for her opinion, and she was not medically qualified to give one.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.930
I was furious.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.120
They nodded gravely, and assured me my throat condition would now be respected.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.060
But I knew this supervisor was directing students to disregard their

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.870
clients' medical conditions in similarly damaging ways.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.220
For instance, one student had a client who'd lie on the floor during therapy

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.130
because he found sitting painful.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.760
Without any medical enquiry, this supervisor directed the student to get

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.529
that client to sit in the chair,

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:40.050
declaring that the client's avoidance of the chair was 'an unconscious attempt

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.980
to sabotage the therapy'.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.490
The student privately expressed serious misgivings,

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.650
but nonetheless

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:47.940
did as he was told.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.870
Steven Weinberg famously said that 'for good people to do evil things,

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:52.679
that takes religion'.

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:55.820
But the same could easily be said of pseudoscience.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.700
These students were good, sensitive people.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.200
I felt sad for them.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.590
But I felt much sadder for their clients.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.650
And that's what makes me angry.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.840
The horrendous abuse of clients.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.660
Chantale Lavigne was reported to have been 'cooked to death' as part of a course run by

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.180
self-styled self-help guru Gabrielle Fréchette.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.089
The session in which Lavigne died was part of a seminar aptly entitled

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:19.730
'Dying in Consciousness.'

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:20.810
in which Fréchette --

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.980
who claimed to channel a biblical figure called Melchisedech --

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.160
had left Chantale, along with eight others, covered in mud,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.870
w wrapped in plastic, then covered in blankets, with boxes over their heads

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.070
for nine hours,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.410
with the instruction to hyperventilate.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.470
Normal body temperature is 37 degrees. Chantale arrived unconscious

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.530
at hospital with a temperature of 40.5.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.590
It was reported that Fréchette denied responsibility,

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.700
that she felt her duty was fulfilled by calling 911,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.250
and that she continued to offer bookings.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.360
Chantale had spent nearly $19,000

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.060
on this fatal course.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.950
Bruce Hines recounted how his Scientologist sister died from

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:58.920
breast cancer.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.520
She'd achieved the highest possible level in Scientology at the time --

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.630
Operating Thetan 8.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.320
Hines explained that, in the 'almost God-like' Operating Thetan state,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.380
you were supposed to be able to leave your body at will,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.500
to be assured of your immortality, and to suffer no physical troubles.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.150
His sister's cancer was slow-moving and easily operable,

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.309
but while Hines acknowledged that many cautious Scientologists take

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:24.750
normal medical treatment, his sister chose not to, believing that 'auditing would

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.700
ake care of it'.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.800
She died aged 55.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.700
Candace Newmaker was just ten years old when she was suffocated in a session

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.320
of pseudoscientific attachment therapy.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.029
This vile practice

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:39.840
involves the forcible psychological regression of children who've failed to bond

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.900
with a parent.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.120
Candace was pinioned under a blanket by four adults, and directed to push herself

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.380
out of it, in a simulation of rebirth, to encourage her to bond like a baby

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.710
with her adoptive mother.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:55.250
Despite Candace screaming that she couldn't breathe, and that she was dying,

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.640
there was no respite.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.470
One of the pseudotherapists, Julie Ponder,

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.210
even taunted her, saying,

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.770
'Go ahead and die right now.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:03.880
For real.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.710
For real.'

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.010
After forty minutes,

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.570
Candace had spoken her last word and stopped moving.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.739
Even so,

00:19:11.739 --> 00:19:13.669
onder continued the abusive ranting,

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:14.500
calling her

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.950
a 'quitter'.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.119
When we attempt to run before we can walk,

00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:24.570
we fall over.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.100
And that's what we see with pseudoscience all the time -- people falling over.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.230
Into abuse,

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.870
bankruptcy, illness and death.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.659
I suspect that will continue

00:19:34.659 --> 00:19:35.900
until we learn to respect

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.150
the gaps in our knowledge;

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.970
to approach them with curiosity and discipline, rather them fill them with

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.370
the easy answers of pseudo-knowledge.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.610
In short, to become

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.990
'gap-friendly'.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.049
Which brings me to scepticism. Scepticism
is not only the most intellectually

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:51.240
honest position,

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.540
it actively crowbars a gap of thought
between stimulus and response so that we

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.820
don't react in pat,

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.230
non-thinking reflexes. We stop to
consider;

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.760
we act with more awareness

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.300
and spontaneity.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.890
Scepticism could've crowbarred a gap of thought into Candace Newmaker's killers,

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.360
who might've stopped to investigate her cries, rather than numbly dismiss them.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.790
Scepticism could also help chickens evolve to fly long distance --

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.090
if they streamlined

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.330
their billowy excesses

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.870
and started applying serious discipline to their lazy,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.710
wack theories.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.769
In view of everything I've said about pseudoscience,

00:20:25.769 --> 00:20:29.210
don't think me a hypocrite if I end by proposing a new metaphorical

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.660
pseudoscience of my own.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.940
A kind of avian alchemy.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.600
Let's turn these kiwis and chickens

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.000
into

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
dodos.
