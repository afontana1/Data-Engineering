00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.590
Malignant individuals and groups
use various methods

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.260
to try and force their targets into submission.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.940
Each method attempts to induce its own distinctive psychological deterrent.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.000
Some try to arouse shame.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.800
Others try to instil a sense of helplessness
and dependence.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.020
Others are designed to create intense confusion.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.760
But the aim is always the same:

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.940
to train targets to doubt their own judgement
and stop them thinking for themselves.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.180
Manipulators can then gradually
impose their rules —

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.940
rules they can change any time they like
which the target will come to accept without question.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.440
Manipulators can also isolate the target

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.180
away from the people who could help them escape.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.440
Targets are taught to despise or even fear these potential sources of support

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.840
leaving them truly cut off.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.460
In healthy families, as they develop

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.780
infants learn to take progressively larger steps.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.520
They risk longer unaccompanied
explorations of their world

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.580
where they encounter some nice things

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.760
and some not-so-nice things.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.080
Secure in the knowledge they can return to safety if they feel overwhelmed

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.980
they learn to cope with the bad

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.600
and enjoy the good.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.040
Their self-reliance increases and their world expands.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.549
Targets of manipulative groups experience

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.260
this developmental process in reverse.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.380
They learn to take smaller steps.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.400
They’re discouraged from engaging with the
outside world

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.560
which is portrayed as hostile and dangerous.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.120
They’re taught that good only exists within the group.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.040
Their self-reliance decreases and their world shrinks.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.580
Piece by piece, they surrender their autonomy

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.320
and succumb to increasing supervision.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.420
When faced with dilemmas, they learn
not to trust their own reasoning

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.920
but to seek advice, direction and permission from the group.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.780
They’ll be instructed to do things

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.000
that arouse great anxiety and distress,
even heartbreak

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.820
like demonising good people

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.940
and shunning loved ones who disagree with the group.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.329
They’ll be told they need to be ‘brave’

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.400
and not give in to these misguided emotions.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.500
The group is their real family.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.920
But their emotions aren’t misguided.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.980
The pain they feel is evidence of their humanity

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.280
— their abiding sense of fairness,
compassion and justice.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.370
But these qualities are antagonistic to groups

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.380
who seek one thing from their targets: compliance.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.050
And targets will be repeatedly forced to choose

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.560
between being loyal to the group
and being true to their humanity.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.500
That choice is perhaps never more stark

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.940
than when a target becomes aware
that a child from the group

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.160
has made an allegation of sexual abuse
against another member.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.640
Is the target’s first thought for the child’s welfare
or the group’s image?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.600
Their answer will provide a gauge of their humanity.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.420
I want to look at a historical case and a current ongoing case

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.180
of manipulative groups that’ve tried to conceal abuse.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.860
And I want to celebrate the genuinely brave individuals

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.300
who’ve worked to expose them.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.220
In 1968, in California,
Christian minister David Berg

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.310
founded the group ‘Teens for Christ’.
It would later become known as:

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.660
‘The Children of God’, ‘The Family’
‘The Family of Love’

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.680
and finally its current name:
‘The Family International’.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.840
Presented himself as fatherly prophet
Berg predicted the world would end in 1993

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.000
and pressed followers into full-time evangelising
to claim as many souls as possible.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.180
Children were frequently sent
to restaurants and businesses

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.860
to sing songs and share their faith.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.720
Followers lived in communes called colonies

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.060
and life in the group was strictly regimented

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.760
with rules on everything from hairstyles to drink consumption to toilet paper.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.540
Anyone who questioned Berg’s ideas was severely reprimanded.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.120
Berg, who called himself ‘Mo’ —&nbsp;short for Moses — 
was a reclusive figure.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.720
Assisted by his wife Karen Zerby

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.040
who declared herself a queen
and renamed herself ‘Mama Maria’

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.660
Berg communicated his ideas, his commandments

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.740
his dreams and professed revelations
to the group

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.340
through sensationally headlined letters called ‘Mo letters’.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.840
These included frequent tirades against people
in the outside world, labelled ‘Systemites’.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.110
Most strikingly, the Mo letters were saturated

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.220
with descriptions and illustrations of sex

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.120
including depictions of Berg being seduced by children.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.420
History’s shown that self-styled divine prophets
create gods in their own images.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.220
David Berg’s doctrines reflected
his own sexual compulsions.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.220
He distilled Christian scripture down to one rule
called the ‘Law of Love’.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.260
As long as it was done in love
Berg claimed it kept their god’s law of love.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.920
Berg used this doctrine to endorse sex
with virtually anyone

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.680
as long as it was done in love

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.080
including children and relatives.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.980
He called it ‘sharing’ and only
male same-sex partners were forbidden.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.580
Berg encouraged his followers to send him
sexually explicit home movies.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.060
He especially enjoyed videos of erotic dancing.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.500
In one film from Family members in Greece

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.860
20 adults and children performed stripteases

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.160
to the strains of Richard Clayderman and Mantovani.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.100
Berg also used the videos to handpick child brides.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.820
Amy Bril, who escaped the group
after her father’s suicide

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.620
said she was transported to Berg’s
secret residence and married to him at 13

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.500
following her performance
in a striptease video.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.740
In the early 1970s, Berg introduced
religious prostitution

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.600
quaintly re-branded ‘Flirty Fishing’
—&nbsp;or ‘FFing’.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.260
He asked female members
if they were willing to be nailed

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.669
like the Biblical character Jesus
was nailed to a cross

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.160
and sent them out to seduce strangers.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.880
In a Mo letter called ‘The 7 F’s of FFing’

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.060
he outlined the various ways these strangers
— called ‘Fish’ — could serve the group.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.080
Some would simply&nbsp;fund the group with sex payments.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.860
Some would become members.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.940
Some in positions of power could even
provide political backing.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.880
In 1975, after Flirty Fishing a local hotel
worker in Tenerife

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.060
Berg’s wife Karen Zerby gave birth to David
Moses Zerby, nicknamed Davidito

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.240
who Berg treated as his own son and successor.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.240
The couple documented every aspect of the boy’s life

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.640
in a book called ‘The story of Davidito’

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.000
which Berg presented as a guide
to raising children.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.520
It became a record of
Davidito’s sexual abuse.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.320
Photos of him in his first three years were
captioned with sexual insinuations

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.680
suggesting he had a ‘come hither’ look
and enjoyed threesomes.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.580
A chapter called ‘My Little Fish’ showed him

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:46.700
in multiple sexual acts with one of his nannies.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.860
Following Berg’s doctrines and personal example

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.610
abuse was widespread within the group.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:58.020
Verity Carter, who escaped the group at 15,
described it as ‘hell on earth’.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.640
She reported being abused
from the age of four

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.980
by various members, including her father was
who convicted.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.140
Author Natacha Tormey, who escaped at 18

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.920
also reported being abused from the age of four

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.880
by a man called ‘Uncle Clay’

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.220
who persisted even when she was down with a fever.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.140
Peter Frouman&nbsp;reported being abused at 11
by a woman of 28

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.700
in front of an approving audience that included his mother.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.120
Because sex between adults and minors
had been normalised

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.320
it didn’t seem like abuse.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.220
Sylvia Padilla raised seven children
in the group.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.820
Aside from being pressured into sex with other
members and into prostitution

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.520
Sylvia eventually discovered the abuse her
children suffered.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.760
Of her first four children, the two youngest,
Victoria and Miriam

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:48.710
reported being pushed to perform stripteases
in their early teens.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.180
The second oldest, Debbie, was molested
between the ages of 9 and 12

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.000
by a member living at their home.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.040
On discovering the abuse, Sylvia threw him out.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.180
But when Debbie was 15,
group leaders began molesting her.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.340
Debbie had been prepared to fend off ordinary members

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.040
but she said rejecting leaders felt impossible.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.300
Sylvia’s oldest child, Shuly, didn’t make
it out of the group alive.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.980
At 15, she contracted lupus

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.020
an autoimmune disease that turns the body against itself.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.720
Members were encouraged to shun worldly medicine

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.120
but for a while Shuly accepted drug treatment.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.180
To distract herself from the pain,
she liked to read books.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.300
But books were forbidden.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.540
Shuly decided to write to Berg himself
to ask if it would be okay for her to read.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:43.940
In his public reply, Berg insinuated that
the lupus was her punishment for reading.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:50.020
Eventually, feeling guilty and inadequate
Shuly discontinued her medication.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.500
She died aged 17.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.180
Berg later published a dream in which he met Shuly in heaven

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.420
and was seduced by her.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.960
A graphic depiction of their
sexual encounter followed.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.920
Shuly’s grieving siblings were enraged.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.340
From the start, David Berg presented himself
as a revolutionary

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.660
here to turn the world upside-down,
emulating Jesus.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.260
From this swaggering self-assessment

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:22.140
we should expect to see an individual boldly
asserting himself into the public arena

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.980
fearlessly preaching his message to the masses

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:30.920
openly challenging the authorities of his time
with unwavering conviction.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.840
But Berg was a make-believe revolutionary.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.680
He kept his doctrines secret within the safe
confines of his devoted group

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.200
taking great efforts to hide them from outsiders.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.640
This included multiple ‘purges’

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.280
in which the group was told to edit or destroy

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.200
sexually explicit publications, like the Davidito book.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.240
Members were threatened with
excommunication for non-compliance.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.400
Some letters were pre-emptively
labelled ‘BAR Pub’

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.860
meaning burn after reading publication.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.580
Group representatives denied
all accusations of abuse.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.120
When questioned about
the Padilla family’s allegations

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.700
a group spokesman called ‘Solomon’ rejected
them outright with four key denials.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.620
Denial number one: he said no one told members
to ‘share’ themselves sexually.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.680
But in a Mo letter called ‘One Wife’,
couples who didn’t share

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.060
were accused of failing to put
the larger family first.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.820
Berg warned that their god would only take
the willing and abandon the rest.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.860
Reluctant members were told they must have
a demon inside them

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.340
or that they didn’t love their god enough.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.820
Escapees have reported having to follow sharing schedules

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.440
created by leaders to ensure everyone shared
with everyone else.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.440
The fact is members were routinely told
to have sex with other members

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.920
and coerced if they resisted.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.840
Denial number two: ‘Solomon’ claimed ‘Flirty
Fishing’ was never synonymous with sex.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.940
He said it could simply mean
going to a bar or a park

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.440
and talking to someone about Jesus.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.640
In fact, Flirty Fishing was synonymous with prostitution

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.500
as illustrated by Berg’s synonyms for Flirty Fishers:

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.420
‘God’s Whores’ and ‘Hookers for Jesus’.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.540
Denial number three: ‘Solomon’ said the group
hadn’t produced pornography

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.240
and claimed no knowledge
of any videos dedicated to Berg.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.040
In a 1995 court hearing, the group made the
same denial under divine oath.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.580
After tapes were produced in evidence
they changed their story

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:37.300
claiming the videos were just intended
to instil a positive body image in its members.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.160
But the intention was undeniably pornographic.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.080
Pornography is defined as forms of media designed
to be sexually arousing.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.240
In a Mo letter called Glorify God in the Dance

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.640
Berg openly stated that he used the videos
as a ‘lively accompaniment’ to sex.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.200
Over 30 highly repetitive pages, he then gave
detailed instructions

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.200
regarding what turned him on

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.400
restating ad nauseam that dancers should be naked

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.760
except for a see-through scarf or veil

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.880
and should dance in a provocative
tantalising teasing way

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.000
because stolen peeks and secret looks
were more exciting.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.960
Finally, we have denial number four:

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.680
‘Solomon’ said the group didn’t believe in
sex between minors and adults.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.180
In 1989, Berg released an official public
denial to that effect

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.720
claiming sex with minors was absolutely forbidden.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.280
In the body of his statement

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.140
Berg cited the much-criticised ‘My Little Fish’
chapter in the Davidito book

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.860
that showed the boy’s nanny molesting him.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.480
Berg attempted to scapegoat her, claiming
the chapter reflected

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.940
her own personal experience and opinions

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.220
and that such intimate relationships
between minors and adults

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.420
had never been encouraged or condoned in the group.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:14:01.220
But Berg’s official encouragement, condonation
and participation was prolific and undeniable

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.640
from his repeated justifications in group publications

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.980
to the child brides he molested,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.980
including his own granddaughter Merry Berg

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.540
a brave and inspiring individual
who endured unthinkable abuse

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.480
and became an outspoken critic of the group.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.800
Another branch of child molestation
in the group

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.380
was revealed by Anneke and Ron Schieberl

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.940
who’ve helped over 50 individuals escape

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.580
and acclimatise to the outside world.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.540
They reported that they quit the group
when leaders told Ron

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.580
they wanted him to have sex with
a 12 year old to humble her arrogance.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.320
Ron refused and threatened action
against anyone else who complied.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.340
Following Berg’s public denouncement of child sex

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.029
privately, the approval continued.

00:14:46.029 --> 00:14:50.620
A secret letter to the group from Karen Zerby
revealed their defiant attitude.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:56.540
In it, she stated fondling children was not
wrong and did not constitute abuse.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.920
And she anticipated a time when the group
would take a stand

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.480
and be truthful about the subject.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.400
Some years later, she would see her son

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.060
the boy called Davidito

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.740
take a stand of his own.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.220
Going by the new name of Ricky Rodriguez

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.140
he tracked down and killed one of his abusers

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.320
a nanny called Angela Smith

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.540
then committed suicide.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.900
For David Berg and his representatives,
the lies flowed freely

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.820
even under divine oath.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.220
Many high-control ideological groups
teachtheir members

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.280
that it’s fine to employ deception
in certain circumstances.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.720
Deception can even become an official policy
with its own special name.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.580
In Berg’s group, it was called
‘deceivers yet true’.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.440
Rules were laid out about what kinds of deception
were acceptable.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.560
Deceiving other Family members
was strictly forbidden

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.800
as was deceiving for selfish motives like
avoiding punishment for wrongdoings.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.340
But non-members, who were considered
to be serving the Devil

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.820
were said to have no right to the truth.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.000
As is repeatedly observed
in high-control groups

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.840
the leadership failed to follow its own rules.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.720
Berg had no problem lying to avoid punishment

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.640
and was happy to throw other group members
under the bus

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.660
to evade prosecution by authorities.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.220
And in her book
‘Born into the Children of God’

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.279
Natacha Tormey revealed a twisted way in which
children were trained

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.860
to break the rule of always telling the truth
to Family members.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.460
When she was four, some adult members came
to interview the children separately

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.400
asking if anyone had touched them
in a bad way.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.680
Although Natacha had been abused
by a man called ‘Clay’

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.820
her instincts prompted her to lie
and say no.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.100
The next morning it was revealed
that the interviews had been a test

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.640
of the children’s loyalty to the group.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.300
A girl called Samantha who reported
being abused

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:55.290
was then publicly forced to eat soap then
wear a cardboard sign saying:

00:16:55.290 --> 00:17:01.800
‘I am on silence restriction for telling lies.
Please do not speak to me.’

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.720
The message to the children was clear:
Don’t tell anyone you were abused.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:14.040
The most effective way to conceal child abuse
is to ensure the children never make any allegations

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.240
— not even to those they’re taught to trust.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.960
When an allegation is made,
other cover-up tactics are required.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.080
Cover-ups can employ a huge range of strategies,
often in combination.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.700
Sometimes allegations can be buried before they become public.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.860
Accusers can be bribed and/or threatened

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:49.040
— a method employed by the Catholic Church
to cover up child molestation by its clergy.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.920
Sometimes damning evidence
can be altered or destroyed

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.820
as Berg’s group tried to do.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.200
Once an allegation’s been made public,
other strategies come into play

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.940
including various forms of denial.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.420
The accused can simply lie
and deny the allegation flat out.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.540
They can deny knowledge or recall of the offence.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.740
They can deny that the offence comes
within their sphere of responsibility.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:20.140
Or that the offence was as serious or far-reaching
as their accusers allege.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.900
Another strategy is evasion.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.020
The accused might try to avoid being questioned

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.340
—&nbsp;wriggling out of court attendance
by claiming illness or bereavement

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:35.140
or even becoming a fugitive as Berg
did to elude authorities.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.870
They might falsely claim some duty of secrecy

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.880
which prevents them sharing damning material.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.240
In some groups new members
are given different names.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.240
This happened with Natacha Tormey’s
abuser ‘Clay’

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.580
who’d been rebaptised to reflect Berg’s idea

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.940
that members should be mouldable
like clay on a potter’s wheel.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:59.000
Blurring identities can help abusers evade justice.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.900
Some defendants choose to go on the offensive
with counter-accusations.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.000
Attacking their accuser’s character and motives.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.280
Claiming their rights are being violated.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.920
Claiming unfair prejudice or persecution.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.540
Maybe the most slippery strategies are the
ones involving misdirection

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.000
— otherwise known as smoke and mirrors —

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.580
which direct our attention to the wrong place

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.220
with misleading and irrelevant information.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.800
Angus asks Geoffrey: ‘Does your church
accept corporal punishment for children?’

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.700
Geoffrey replies: ‘Our church expects parents
to discipline and raise their children.’

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:43.260
This is misdirection, completely bypassing
the central question of corporal punishment

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.560
by answering an unasked question
of Geoffrey’s own invention.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.470
Meaningless phrases can be used

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.400
to give a parody of answering
while saying nothing.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.040
Zara asks Jag: ‘Does your group have any
female leaders?’

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.660
The truth is his group doesn’t accept
female leaders.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.240
To try and cover up that truth, he replies:
‘Women are crucial.’

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.760
This statement is meaningless. It doesn’t
specify how women are crucial.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.040
But he hopes this deflection will sound
affirmative enough

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.200
to stop the awkward questions.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.460
Later, if the truth comes out, he can
truthfully say he didn’t lie.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.680
What he can’t truthfully say
is he didn’t intend to deceive.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:32.520
Defendants can misdirect by using misleading, unrepresentative examples.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.000
Children of God’s spokesman ‘Solomon’ did this

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.200
when he downplayed Flirty Fishing
as a conversation about Jesus in a park.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.230
And, like Berg did with Davidito’s nanny

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.260
scapegoats can be offered up to direct
attention away from the guilty.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.980
Even if the guilty party’s forced to admit
to some wrongdoing

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.700
the cover-up can continue.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.920
To get the authorities off their backs

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.780
abusive groups will sometimes fake interest
in reformation.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:05.120
They’ll promise to ‘consider the recommendations’
of official judicial panels

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.540
and undertake to introduce new safeguards.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.460
But it’s just word games.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.080
There’s no intention to change —&nbsp;and
the abuse will go on.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.680
A number of these tactics
have been repeatedly used

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.380
by senior Jehovah’s Witnesses
to try and cover up

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.200
hundreds of cases of child molestation
within their organisation

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.080
and the doctrines that’ve helped
to perpetuate that abuse.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.320
Denial is nothing new to the leaders of the
separatist Christian group

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:54.870
Jehovah’s Witnesses, whose religious symbol
is a watchtower.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.120
Any religious group in the habit of predicting
the end of the world

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.340
inevitably become practiced at cover-up techniques

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.100
when their prophecies fail —&nbsp;as they invariably do.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.260
For The Children of God, armageddon
was predicted to arrive in 1993.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.160
For Jehovah’s Witnesses,
numerous termination dates

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.740
spanning over a century have come and gone

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.940
— including the year 1975.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.860
Like David Berg, the Jehovah’s Witness leadership

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.580
—&nbsp;known as the Governing Body —

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.960
produces a range of publications to convey their ideas

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.760
including their magazines ‘Awake!’
and ‘The Watchtower’.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.400
Those publications heavily pushed
the 1975 end-time prediction.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.049
The year was derived using Biblical chronology

00:22:38.049 --> 00:22:40.580
to calculate the date of the supposed first human

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.220
Adam at 4026 B.C.E.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.040
then adding 6,000 years —&nbsp;the allotted time
for humanity’s existence.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.620
According to the Governing Body, at the end-time

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.960
only members of Jehovah’s organisation would
qualify for eternal life.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.800
The rest would be annihilated.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.890
In 1969, Awake! Magazine told young people

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.260
they needed to face the fact they would never
grow old in the present system

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.860
and never fulfil any career
the world had to offer.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.620
In the previous year, the Kingdom Ministry
publication urged members

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.780
to get into pioneering ministry for the organisation

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.460
telling them there were only
about 90 months left

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.320
before human existence was completed.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.100
In 1974, the publication then applauded members

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.800
who had sold their homes
to devote themselves to pioneering

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.280
remarking that it was a fine way to spend
the short time remaining

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.500
before the wicked world’s end.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.480
The armageddon prediction changed many lives.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.300
Witnesses gave up opportunities
in education and business.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.840
Insurance policies were cancelled.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.180
Some put off having children.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.520
What was the leadership doing?

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.820
Buying new property.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.180
In the early part of 1975, humanity’s final year

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.860
the organisation bought the fifteen-story
Towers Hotel in Brooklyn.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:06.140
While they were encouraging and praising
huge sacrifices among their flock

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.360
they were expanding their real estate.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.840
When 1975 passed without incident,
the Governing Body went into denial.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.559
In July 1976, they said Witnesses who’d
put off or neglected things

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.180
they otherwise would’ve cared for
had got it wrong.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:28.160
It was their own fault for thinking Bible
chronology revealed a specific date.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.530
So, to excuse its own blunders,
the Governing Body scapegoated

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.150
all the Witnesses who’d been
guided by its blunders.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.080
It also altered evidence.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.160
In the 1968 edition of its publication
‘The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life’

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.740
it quoted a prediction made in 1960

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.980
by former US Secretary of State Dean Acheson

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.060
that in fifteen years time —&nbsp;ie 1975 —

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.780
the world would be too dangerous to live in.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.860
But in the revised 1981 edition
the specific timeframe of fifteen years

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.660
was conspicuously replaced with the word ‘soon’.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.640
In recent years, the Governing Body’s come
under scrutiny for another cover-up

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.120
this time regarding child sexual abuse.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.480
The hypocrisy of this cover-up is as brazen as it gets.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.540
In a barrage of articles in Awake! Magazine

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.140
the Governing Body has repeatedly pointed
a sanctimonious finger at the Catholic church

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.440
for its institutional cover-up
of child molestation by its priests

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.860
noting the long-term, often permanent, damage
done to the child.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.160
These articles cast the Governing Body
as a champion of children.

00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:42.120
A 2011 article correctly reported that abuse
by priests was ignored

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.250
because of loyalty to the absolute authority
of the Catholic church.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.429
It neglected to mention that loyalty to the
Jehovah’s Witness Governing Body

00:25:50.429 --> 00:25:53.690
which exercises vastly greater control over
its flock

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.280
has had the same silencing effect.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.881
A 1993 article accused the Catholic church

00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:04.360
of compounding the initial sexual abuse
with a second more painful psychological abuse

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.480
—&nbsp;the abuse of failing to listen or take
accusations seriously

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.640
and only protecting abusers.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.620
A 1990 article accused the Catholic Church
of hushing up cases

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.920
and taking no significant disciplinary action.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.160
But people in glass watchtowers
really shouldn’t throw stones.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.780
As I’ll be showing, the Jehovah’s Witness
organisation is also guilty on every count.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.740
The problem of child abuse
isn’t exclusive to any group.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.180
But it can become entrenched in groups that
put up obstacles to justice.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.040
One obstacle the Jehovah’s Witness Governing
Body shares with the Catholic church

00:26:40.049 --> 00:26:43.240
is its preening concern for reputation.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.180
Valuing public image over the welfare
of their members

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.120
has led both organisations to focus their energies

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.960
on hiding their shame rather than tackling the abuse.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.100
But the Jehovah’s Witness leadership has erected
other special obstacles.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.590
Through a combination of maladaptive doctrines

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:05.420
it’s created an organisation that enables
molesters and exiles their prey.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.660
One doctrine that protects molesters is something
called the ‘two witness’ rule.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.580
Based on passages from Deuteronomy and 1 Timothy

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.780
the two-witness rule demands that
congregational leaders called ‘elders’

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.580
have to hear the testimony of at least
two witnesses to convict an abuser.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.820
Obviously the private nature of child sexual abuse

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.180
renders this condition extremely improbable.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.840
In the absence of two witnesses, a confession
is required from the abuser.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:38.340
If no confession is made, the matter is considered
to be in the hands of Jehovah.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:43.400
So all abusers have to do to enjoy a life
of carefree child molestation

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.880
is make sure they’re not seen
and decline to confess.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.240
This astounding leniency in favour of the abuser

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.780
isn’t always evident with other offences.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.620
‘Shepherd the Flock of God’
—&nbsp;a judicial guidebook for elders —

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.000
gives a hypothetical case in which a married man

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.440
is observed to stay overnight
at the house of his secretary

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.840
but denies committing adultery.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.360
Despite the fact that there are
no witnesses to adultery

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.380
and no confession has been obtained

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.060
it’s claimed there’s strong enough
circumstantial evidence

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.440
of sexual impropriety to warrant judicial action

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.740
and even to allow the wife to divorce and remarry

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.520
which is a rare privilege among Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.410
who generally equate remarriage with adultery

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.900
based on Matthew 19, verse 9.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.680
So, for adults, just seeing someone
go in and out of a house

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.780
is enough to establish adultery.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.520
Meanwhile, abused children need
multiple witnesses or a confession.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.080
Otherwise, case closed.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.780
The Governing Body likes to project the image
of an organisation beyond reproach.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.980
To maintain this illusion, congregations are instructed

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.880
to shun individuals regarded as troublesome,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.020
including close relatives.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.660
This is based on a line from 1 Corinthians:

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.480
‘remove the wicked man from among yourselves’.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.060
This doctrine might seem perfect
for ridding the organisation of abusers.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.240
Instead it repeatedly works to expel the abused.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.680
There are two main paths to getting shunned.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.160
The voluntary path is disassociation.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:19.140
Here, the person quits the organisation
making a formal declaration of departure.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.820
They’ll then be treated
as if they no longer exist.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.480
The involuntary path is disfellowshipping.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.880
Here, the organisation expels and shuns individuals

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.860
who are deemed unrepentantly guilty
of ‘wicked deeds’.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:38.320
These include offences like theft and assault
but also extend to the following:

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.240
artificial insemination by donor, which is
equated with adultery;

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.380
celebrating Christmas or participating in
interfaith activities;

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.940
smoking or selling tobacco; professional boxing;

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.740
failure to abstain from blood transfusions;

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.560
and associating with disfellowshipped individuals.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.140
Another offence is causing divisions
—&nbsp;which can be applied

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.360
to anyone who challenges or criticises
the Governing Body.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.560
Disassociation and disfellowshipping
both favour the molester.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.900
When their abusers’s guilt is left in Jehovah’s hands

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.620
children face the prospect of risking
ongoing retraumatisation

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.520
by remaining in congregations
that protect their abusers.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.620
Inevitably, some children will feel
driven to disassociate.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.140
For the abuser, there’s no incentive to disassociate.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.200
So disassociation works in the abuser’s favour.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.280
The threat of disfellowshipping
has been repeatedly used to silence allegations.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:41.880
Washington resident Erica Garza initially
confided to her father about her sexual abuse

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.120
perpetrated by his best friend.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.960
As an elder he’d been instructed
never to call the police.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.410
But when the organisation took no action

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.280
Erica said she’d go to the police herself.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.520
Her elders said if she did she’d be disfellowshipped

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.820
and condemned by Jehovah.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:05.080
Despite this, she went ahead and her abuser was charged and convicted on four counts.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.620
Erica and her supportive family were shunned.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.660
Child safety advocates also get disfellowshipped
for speaking out.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.280
Barbara Anderson was a Jehovah’s Witness
for 43 years.

00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:22.320
In the 1990s, working as a researcher at the
Watchtower headquarters in New York

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.610
she found files containing hundreds of accusations
against male and female members

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.620
along with evidence that the organisation
had privately settled

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.420
numerous expensive abuse lawsuits.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.180
After discussing these facts
in a 2002 ‘Dateline’ NBC news report

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.860
she was disfellowshipped.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:44.540
She said she was later told thousands of members
had left the religion following the report

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:49.660
and that she’d been blamed for their annihilation
in the coming armageddon.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.919
While abused children and their advocates
are threatened with disfellowshipping

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.960
merely for seeking the justice
their organisation fails to provide

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.320
for the shrewd abuser the threat
of disfellowshipping is non-existent.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:07.680
In 2002, BBC’s Panorama reported the case
of Ian Cousins

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.380
who confessed to elders that he’d molested
one of his daughters.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.780
Their response?

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:17.560
He was instructed to apologise, sent home with the daughter he molested

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:23.320
and the congregation was informed that he’d been reproved for an unspecified wrongdoing.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.000
Incredibly, that was it.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.560
This is the organisation
that accused the Catholic Church

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.860
of taking no significant disciplinary action.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.300
Unsurprisingly, with no consequences to constrain him

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.180
Cousins continued molesting his daughter.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:43.380
When she moved out to escape the abuse
he turned on his other daughter, Alison.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.560
Like her sister, Alison said she informed
an elder of the abuse

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.320
but was accused of lying

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.000
even though they had access
to his previous confession of abuse.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.640
Eventually she told the elders unless they
did something, she’d call the police.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.750
In the following police investigation

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:04.000
Alison learned of her sister’s abuse and
her father’s confession.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.080
The Panorama report noted:

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.580
‘When he confessed to congregation elders,
Cousins got a mild rebuke.’

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.500
‘When he confessed in court, he got five years in jail.’

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.980
In 2015, another abused individual explained

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:23.680
how the organisation rationalises its rejection
of secular authorities in abuse cases.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.140
Testifying anonymously

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:30.360
to the Australian Royal Commission into
Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.080
she recounted being threatened with
disfellowshipping if she called the police

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.340
by an elder who quoted 1 Corinthians 6: verses 1-8

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.010
which forbids taking brothers to court.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:47.669
The Commission heard evidence that the organisation
had kept records of 1,006 alleged abusers

00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:52.420
in Australia since 1950
—&nbsp;none of them reported to police.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.520
I’ll be exploring the Royal Commission’s
investigation in a future video.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.620
Apparently this scriptural justification
doesn’t extend to all crime.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.780
In 2016, a letter to the elders regarding
their ‘Kingdom Halls’

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.580
— their places of worship —

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.600
stated that theft and vandalism should be
promptly reported to the local authorities.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:21.300
It explains: ‘When property damage occurs quick
action can go far in preventing further damage’.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.240
Is that sentiment any less true
of damage to children?

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:29.140
Are children less important than property?

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:34.120
By its actions, the organisation reveals its true values.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.440
Jehovah’s Witness literature repeatedly plays
on wolf and sheep imagery

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.580
comparing non-Witnesses and ex-Witnesses
to oppressive wicked wolves

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.920
intent on attacking a pure and vulnerable flock.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.040
In reality, the doctrines
of the Jehovah’s Witness leadership

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.820
systematically protect the wolves
inside the organisation

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.660
while forcing the sheep out of the flock.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.220
Is it plausible that a benevolent
super-intelligent divine being

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.160
would create such an glaringly flawed system?

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:15.760
Or does this ugly mess have distinctly
human fingerprints all over it?

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.980
It’s disorientating enough when survivors of child abuse

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.740
get shunned by an organisation
that claims to champion children.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.080
But they’re hit by another curveball

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.980
when the organisation’s representatives
refuse to admit that it practices shunning.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.640
Whether it’s in news interviews,
in door-to-door preaching

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:36.980
or in court hearings under divine oath

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.900
when the subject of shunning comes up

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.000
Witnesses repeatedly go into cover-up mode.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.720
Suddenly this strictly enforced doctrine

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.260
gets misrepresented
as a matter of personal choice.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.780
Some witnesses even play the prejudice card

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:55.580
complaining that the term shunning
evokes unwelcome stereotypes.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:01.780
The organisation’s subterfuge regarding
shunning extends to its website —&nbsp;jw.org.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:07.380
In its FAQ article ‘Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Shun
Former Members of Their Religion?’

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.360
it even dodges its own question.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.080
The article says baptised Witnesses who’ve
drifted away

00:36:13.089 --> 00:36:16.240
or no longer preach are not shunned.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.960
This is a misleading example.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.640
The organisation doesn’t classify these
individuals as former members.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.840
They’re called ‘inactive’ members
—&nbsp;or ‘faders’.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:31.040
To become former members they’d have to
disassociate or get disfellowshipped.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.240
Then they would be shunned.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.860
The article claims if a man’s disfellowshipped

00:36:35.869 --> 00:36:38.640
and his wife and children are Jehovah’s
Witnesses

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.720
normal family affections and dealings continue.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.540
This is another misleading example.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.279
Relatives living in the same household are
considered a special case

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.920
in that the organisation allows
a degree of association.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.140
What the article neglects to mention

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.740
is that if disfellowshipped family members
ever move out of the house

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:03.040
barring necessary family business,
they can be shunned like any stranger.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.500
As the organisation comments with apparent relish:

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.960
if the disfellowshipped or disassociated one

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.600
is a relative living outside the immediate
family circle and home

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.780
it might be possible to have almost no contact
at all with the relative.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:23.700
The truth is Witnesses are told to avoid
all normal contact with disfellowshipped relatives

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.240
— including text messages and emails —

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.840
and not to look for excuses
to associate with them.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.789
Witnesses who maintain unnecessary association

00:37:32.789 --> 00:37:37.280
with disfellowshipped relatives
can be disfellowshipped themselves.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.900
How does an organisation
that claims to represent ‘the Truth’

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:46.580
justify its deliberate use of deception to
conceal the sexual abuse of children

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:51.700
and the doctrine of shunning to which many
of those abused children are then subjected?

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.280
Jehovah’s Witness literature
claims ‘all lying is bad’

00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:00.180
and quotes Biblical passages denouncing lies
as detestable to Jehovah.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:05.380
But like David Berg, the organisation gives
itself licence to deceive.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.860
Just as Berg had his ‘deceivers yet true’ doctrine

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.940
the Jehovah’s Witness Governing Body has
its own version

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.440
called ‘theocratic war strategy’
or ‘theocratic warfare’.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:21.080
Like Berg’s doctrine, it strictly forbids
lying to fellow members.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.820
Like Berg’s doctrine, it denounces lying
for selfish motives.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:31.640
And like Berg’s doctrine, it asserts that
non-members are not entitled to the truth.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.660
Putting these two groups side by side highlights
the perversity of these doctrines.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.140
Here we have two groups who would each accuse
the other of false teaching

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.320
but wouldn’t consider them entitled to know
the truth.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.340
Both groups claim their own brand
of deception is fine

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.580
while the other group’s is wicked.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.540
They’re mirror images

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.900
each accusing the other while exonerating themselves.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:02.180
This is the absurdity that results from the hypocritical systems of supremacist groups

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.400
who judge others on standards
they themselves decline to follow.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.270
The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:12.760
claims deception is only used
to prevent harm or persecution.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.480
But does covering up child sexual abuse qualify as preventing harm or persecution?

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.460
The problem becomes clear when we
bring back the Catholic Church.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:27.600
If the Governing Body wants to defend its cover-up
on the grounds of preventing harm or persecution

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.760
it has to accept the same defence from the
Catholic Church over its cover-up.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.940
More to the point, if it rejects that defence
from the Catholic Church

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.040
it has no defence itself.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.740
Another hypocrisy regarding the Catholics

00:39:41.749 --> 00:39:45.769
concerns the guilt trip
Jehovah’s Witness elders repeatedly use

00:39:45.769 --> 00:39:49.360
to stop children
reporting their abuse to the authorities.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.180
Children are told they’ll bring reproach
on Jehovah’s name.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.680
But in its many criticisms regarding
Catholic child abuse

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.520
did the Governing Body reproach their god?

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:06.460
No. It reproached the church, the pope, the clergy
— the humans who allowed it.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.720
Likewise, when cases of child abuse
by Jehovah’s Witnesses emerge

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.640
no one’s reproaching Jehovah.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:20.520
They’re reproaching the organisation, the Governing Body, the elders —&nbsp;the humans who allow it.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.200
Telling children they’ll bring reproach on Jehovah

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.080
isn’t just emotionally abusive.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.720
It’s a lie.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:33.760
The organisation’s cover-up regarding shunning also fails to qualify as preventing harm or persecution.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.420
It does put the organisation in a very unattractive light.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.120
But it’s an accurate light.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.540
The abusive nature of shunning

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.420
is something the organisation itself
unwittingly acknowledged

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:49.720
in a 2013 Awake! article about the silent treatment.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.760
It noted with disapproval how some people
use the silent treatment

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.580
to punish or to manipulate others into compliance.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:02.100
It even asked readers if that was really how
they want to treat people they love.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:07.220
That question can be thrown right back at
the Governing Body in regards to shunning.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:13.640
The Jehovah’s Witness organisation
is a group wrestling with huge internal contradictions

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:20.229
wanting to project a pure, morally clean image
to an outside world it despises

00:41:20.229 --> 00:41:24.839
and in the process, neglecting and abusing
its own members

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.980
in the most callous, heartless ways.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:46.300
The Biblical passage Matthew 7:16, says:
‘By their fruits you will recognise them.’

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.200
The Jehovah’s Witness leadership claims

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:54.180
that its organisation’s authenticity
can be recognised by its fruits.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:58.780
It asserts that any religion
unable to unite its devotees

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.840
cannot have the key for uniting humankind.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.040
And it claims that the fruits of peace and harmony

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.720
found within its organisation

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.920
is proof that it has that key.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.260
Any group that routinely expels
individuals who criticise or challenge it

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:19.200
will eventually be left with a pool of uncritical, compliant followers.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.540
That isn’t the same as ‘uniting your devotees’.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:27.660
To unite means to bring together
—&nbsp;to eradicate divisions.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:32.340
Eradicating people, as the Jehovah’s Witness
organisation does

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:35.600
only proves its inability to unite them.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.760
Silence does not imply peace and harmony.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.540
Silence can be pregnant with anguish.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.900
For children whose desperate reports of abuse
are repeatedly dismissed as lies

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.620
and who are threatened with expulsion

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.620
for the sin of tainting their religion’s
false image of pureness

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.100
there is no peace or harmony.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.800
David Berg and the Jehovah’s Witness leadership

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.600
had opposing views on sex with children.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.900
But both groups became a sanctuary for molesters.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.660
In Berg’s case, his doctrines
actively condoned abuse.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:13.000
In the case of the Jehovah’s Witness leadership,
even though it denounces abuse

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.719
its maladaptive doctrines work to perpetuate it

00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:20.539
by silencing abused individuals
and their advocates

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:24.760
and teaching smart abusers that by simply
uttering an apology

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.320
they can avoid all consequences
and continue their molesting.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:34.420
In any healthy group, dangerously flawed procedures
are acknowledged and urgently corrected.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:41.900
But in groups that claim timeless divine authority
flaws are preserved in the formaldehyde of faith.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.509
Many individuals abused in dogmatic groups

00:43:44.509 --> 00:43:48.559
like Berg’s Family and the
Jehovah’s Witness organisation

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.540
have been amazed at the warmth, care and support
they’ve received from the outside world

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.760
— a world whose inhabitants they’d been
taught to demonise.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.200
It’s an eye-opening contrast to the cold,
defensive, often accusing treatment

00:44:01.209 --> 00:44:03.920
they received in their former group.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.280
By their fruits, we will recognise
the true natures of groups.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.900
The genuinely benevolent ones
won’t be found concealing abuse.
