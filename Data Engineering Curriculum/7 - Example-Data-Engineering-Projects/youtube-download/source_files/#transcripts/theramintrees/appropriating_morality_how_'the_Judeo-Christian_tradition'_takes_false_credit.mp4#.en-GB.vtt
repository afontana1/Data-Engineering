00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.220
How do we formulate our moral values?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.660
Do we just copy those around us?

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.510
Do we judge our actions to be okay

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.180
if we see other people doing them?

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.660
Do we continue to behave exactly

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.920
how we were trained to behave as children?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.260
Do we allow our values to be decided for us

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.100
by an external authority?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.820
parents, peer groups, professors

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.940
politicians, priests, prophets?

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.460
Do we question the values we encounter

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.750
and construct our own values

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.180
based on critical assessments?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.500
Many members of religious ideologies

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.390
give credit to their religion
for their moral values.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.410
But some go further and take credit
on behalf of their religion

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.720
for the moral values of non-members.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.680
It’s been claimed time and time again

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.369
— and it’s still being claimed —

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.820
that people who live their lives

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.640
without any belief in gods,
religion or the supernatural

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.880
have nonetheless had their morals shaped

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.300
by the dominant religions
of their geographical region.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.180
It’s a predictable claim.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.860
Many religious individuals regard their religion

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.920
as the fundamental or even exclusive source

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.860
of human morality.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.900
For them, if non-believers appear
to lead decent, moral lives

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.640
it must be down to the pervasive influence
of their religion.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.620
In the West, it’s claimed that secular morals
have been shaped

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.440
by something referred to
as ‘the Judeo-Christian tradition’

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.560
— a hybrid of Judaism and Christianity.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.260
So, should we allow the credit
for our core moral values

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.320
to be appropriated in this way?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900
When people claim that secular values

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.140
borrow from the Judeo-Christian tradition

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.820
what’s striking is their decision
to ignore all history

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.560
before the emergence of Judaism and Christianity.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.720
Modern human beings had been in existence

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.400
for over 100,000 years by the time Judaism

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.080
— a much older religion than Christianity —

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.820
was in its infancy.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.880
Are we expected to accept
that until the advent of Judaism

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.460
human beings had developed no sense

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.880
of how to treat each other
to co-exist as social creatures?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.420
Did the values of these religions
somehow spring

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.880
ready-made from a moral vacuum with no reference

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.780
to the values of the local cultures of the time?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.120
Of course they didn’t.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.260
Both religions borrowed from pre-existing

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.800
social conventions and principles.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.920
It’s understandable that those who argue

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.359
for the primacy of Judeo-Christian values

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.290
would want to stop the historical search

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.549
for moral values at their own religion

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.020
but there’s no valid justification for doing so.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.139
Certain principles of moral conduct

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.540
tend to emerge naturally in social groups

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.840
purely because they help to preserve the group

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.910
— for example, the basic principle ‘don’t kill’.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.010
A culture that adopts the principle:

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.720
‘kill as many people as you can indiscriminately’

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.620
isn’t going to survive long.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.200
When a religion comes along and lays down laws

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.390
reflecting social conventions and principles

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.070
already in existence across humanity

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.230
like not stealing and not murdering

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.889
that religion doesn’t suddenly own

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.560
the intellectual rights to those principles.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.980
Religion is not the innovator here,
just an imitator.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.120
Animal studies show that non-human social species

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.600
demonstrate empathy, compassion

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.750
and an awareness of fairness

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.180
which are significant ingredients in morality.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.880
Primatologist Frans de Waal and his colleagues

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.510
found that when given the choice to swap

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.510
different kinds of token
for different food rewards

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.669
chimpanzees and capuchins frequently swapped
‘prosocial’ tokens

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.169
which rewarded both themselves and a partner
of their species

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.200
rather than ‘selfish’ tokens which rewarded
them alone.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.340
Capuchins have been observed to reward partners

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.410
for cooperation in a task to gain food

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.480
even when they have the choice to keep all
of it for themselves.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.410
They’ve also been observed to protest aggressively

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.400
when they see a fellow capuchin receiving
a better reward

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.600
for performing the same task.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.160
After fights, chimpanzees display distinctive
reconciliation behaviour

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.900
stretching out a hand to an enemy,
kissing, embracing and grooming.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.960
Basic equitable behaviour demonstrating
a keen sense of fairness

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.540
has been observed in a range of social species.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.080
To suggest religion is the source

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.040
of this equitable behaviour is plainly absurd.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.260
And it’s no less absurd to suggest

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.800
it’s the source of human equitable behaviour.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.520
What exactly is ‘the Judeo-Christian tradition’
supposed to mean?

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.280
Judaism and Christianity show

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.750
significant overlap in their construction

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.160
holding many of the same
ancient texts as sacred.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.780
The Jewish Tanakh contains 24 books

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.260
that appear in the Christian ‘Old Testament’.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.200
But even though these two branches of religion

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.090
share many ancient texts

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.970
there are significant differences
in their translations

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.700
interpretations, perspectives
and foundational values.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.720
Many Jews and Christians strongly object
to being lumped together.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.880
Writing in the 1970s,
Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits commented:

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.620
‘As to dialogue in the purely theological sense’

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.980
‘nothing could be more fruitless or pointless.’

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.010
‘Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity’

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.740
‘and Christianity is Christianity because
it rejects Judaism.’

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.960
‘What is usually referred to
as the Judeo-Christian tradition‘

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.160
’exists only in Christian or secularist fantasy.’

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.600
The Tanakh contains instructions that are
explicitly rejected

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.580
by the figure of Jesus, the Christian messiah

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.020
and Christianity is repeatedly presented

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.220
as a reformation of older Jewish ideas.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.480
For example, in the Jewish Torah

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.470
the book of Vayikra chapter 24,
verses 19-20 states:

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.860
‘And a man who inflicts an injury upon his
fellow man’

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.640
‘just as he did, so shall be done to him’

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.780
‘fracture for fracture, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth.’

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.460
The Christian equivalent in the Old testament

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.520
book of Leviticus reiterates this.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.520
This is an explicit instruction to reciprocate injury.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.200
And yet in Matthew 5:43, Jesus explicitly
contradicts this law

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.580
saying ‘You’ve heard that it was said’

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.280
‘ “Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.”
But I tell you….’

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.580
‘If anyone slaps you on the right cheek’

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.980
‘turn to them the other cheek.’

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.860
This verse from the Christian New Testament

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.540
contradicts the Jewish Torah
and its own Old Testament.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.780
In the New Testament, Jesus defends and forgives

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.060
those identified as adulterers and prostitutes

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.720
and admonishes those who judge them.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.940
In the Tanakh and the Old Testament

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.900
adulterers and prostitutes
are condemned to death by fire.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.160
Time after time, fundamentally incompatible
principles are promoted.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.020
So from the outset, any attempt to package

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.639
Judaism and Christianity
as some coalition of faith

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.300
creates an unworkable hybrid,
full of moral contradictions.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.200
But it’s worse than that.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.060
As well as basic conflicts of value

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.420
between Jewish and Christian scripture

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.140
substantially conflicting values are found

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.900
in countless areas between the subdenominations
of each religion.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.280
Some Christians believe that accepting the
biblical figure

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.600
of Jesus as their saviour will allow them

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.820
to enter a post-death paradise called ‘heaven’.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.180
Other Christians believe that who will and won’t

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.120
enter heaven has been decided before birth

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.380
and that nothing a person does

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.400
during their life can change that.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.900
Some Christians are strongly separatist

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.780
distancing themselves from
those outside their group

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.860
who they label with words like ‘worldly’.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.700
Other Christians promote inclusivity
and interfaith dialogue.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.380
Some Jews insist the Torah
is the word of their deity.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.000
Other Jews see the Torah as a collection of
fallible human writings

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.160
which changes their relationship to its instructions.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.640
There are also conflicts about rituals.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.460
Some Jews believe women
and men should be able

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.280
to publicly recite a mourning prayer called
the kaddish.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.480
Others believe it should be reserved for men.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.760
These individual denominations
promote incompatible principles

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.040
so to claim they represent a unified moral
tradition is untenable.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.860
Even if we ignore the conflicting values

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.120
of Judaism and Christianity and focus

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.480
on their common ground, we find problems.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.620
When we look at the texts both religions
regard as sacred

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.520
they contain instructions to put a long list
of people to death.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.100
Of course, even the denominations that insist

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.580
their scripture embodies eternal,
unchanging moral values

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.120
don’t carry out these instructions

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.439
which shows a clear disconnect

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.400
between the moral values in the text

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.520
and what Jews and Christians actually do.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.400
Of course, when a holy book tells us to kill

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.680
blasphemers, unruly children, non-believers

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.160
adulterers and same-sex lovers

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.380
better to be a hypocrite and not carry out

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.899
these barbaric instructions
than commit these killings

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.380
just to be morally consistent
with an immoral book.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.640
But, isn’t it best,
when your own moral sense

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:55.699
tells you an instruction is wrong

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.080
to reject the authority of the instruction?

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.560
When a supposedly holy book tells you

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.320
to carry out executions you know to be immoral

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.400
isn’t the clearest solution to recognise

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.680
that the book isn’t holy at all?

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.900
And that its values have
no place in any civilised morality?

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.080
There’s a fundamental split
between scriptural values

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.320
and modern moral values regarding
the importance of deeds.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.080
With few notable exceptions

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.019
— for example, where illness or coercion
is involved —

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:27.990
we judge people as accountable for their actions

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.740
and expect them to accept personal responsibility.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.759
Christianity, in contrast,
discards this core value

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.040
substituting the acceptance of Jesus

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.720
as the sole consideration.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.500
On the surface, the Bible contains
lots of instructions

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:46.180
about how to behave, but ultimately

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.660
deeds don’t count in Christianity.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.920
A lifetime of bad deeds is obliterated
by accepting Jesus.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.820
A lifetime of good deeds is obliterated
by failure to accept him.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.380
Another fundamental split is seen in the contrast

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.060
between commandment-based
religious moral instruction

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.180
which provides no rational
other than divine authority

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.720
and commonly forbids challenge and criticism

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.200
and secular morality, constructed through

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.180
a process of independent reasoning

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.340
involving ongoing critical discussion
and education.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.600
These differences aren’t trivial.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.580
They have profound consequences

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.500
for our whole relationship with morality.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.880
If we’re asked why a specific behaviour
is morally wrong

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.200
and all we can say is
‘Because a god says so’

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.940
or ‘Because my holy book says so’

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.560
or ‘Because that’s what I’ve been
brought up to believe’

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.380
we haven’t provided a moral answer at all.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.920
We’ve just accepted what we’ve been told
to think by others.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.540
If we’re doing as we’re told

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.480
with no intervening reflection,
copying the crowd

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.620
or simply acting out of fear of punishment
or hope of reward

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.880
we’re not exercising
our individual moral agency.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.280
Alan claims behaviour X is morally wrong

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.360
but argues from religious authority

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.160
or tradition to justify his position.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.660
Ben claims behaviour X is morally wrong

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.560
but justifies his position with valid reasoning.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.040
They might share the same view about the behaviour

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.559
but Ben’s moral outlook owes no debt

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.320
of recognition to Alan’s religion.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.040
The fact that religions promote
values doesn’t mean

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.980
those values are supported by valid reasoning.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.300
In fact it’s through the careful application

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.800
of valid reasoning that we continue to expose

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.740
many historically celebrated
religious values as immoral.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.540
Among a wealth of reprehensible stories

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.420
in the Jewish and Christian scriptures

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.500
are its depictions of atrocities towards children.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.779
In the Old Testament’s book of Numbers

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.080
and its equivalent in the Tanakh, Bamidbar

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.420
we find the prophet Moses giving instructions

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.980
to kill every male child of the Midianites

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.660
and preserve any virgin female children
as sexual stock.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.939
This from the prophet famed for delivering
the Decalogue

00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:04.660
—&nbsp;ten purportedly divine commandments

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.440
governing conduct, thought and worship.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.160
Lyrics to the Melodians’ song
‘Rivers of Babylon’

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.300
— later popularised by Boney M —

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.980
were lifted from Psalm 137 of the Bible.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.260
The song focuses on the parts of the Psalm

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:21.480
that express feelings of victimhood

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.929
recounting how the Jews
were carried away in captivity

00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:26.839
by the Babylonians and told to sing songs.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.780
‘Rivers of Babylon’ might not
have been such a hit

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.259
if it had included verse 9 of the Psalm

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:34.899
which delights in a peculiar form of revenge

00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:37.990
against the Babylonians. It states:

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.329
‘Happy is the one who seizes your infants’

00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:43.500
‘and dashes them against the rocks.’

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.080
Some apologists have claimed
that the word ’infants’

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.280
doesn’t refer to literal infants.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.420
It’s just being used like
the phrase ‘children of Israel’

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.740
to refer to the people of Babylon.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.620
But Isaiah 13:16 echoes the passage in Psalms

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.880
and clearly refers literally to children.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.939
Writing in the 1700s, in his Exposition of
the Entire Bible

00:14:04.939 --> 00:14:07.110
Baptist John Gill commented that:

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.380
‘though it may seem a piece of cruelty’

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.060
it was ‘but a just retaliation.’

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.860
He claimed it was not ‘desired from
a spirit of revenge’

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.220
‘but for the glory of divine justice’.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:24.120
The glorification of infanticide is not a
value that shapes our morals today.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.580
Jewish and Christian bibles contain
a vast range of messages

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.440
from stories of great compassion and tenderness

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.040
to salivating accounts
of the most debased brutality.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.180
We have the fluff and we have the snuff.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.940
But even some of the fluffy stuff

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.860
isn’t quite so fluffy on closer inspection.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.620
As a former Christian, I was taught

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.200
to see Jesus as the embodiment of love.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.760
But the fact is Jesus was no respecter

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.600
of loving relationships
that didn’t include him

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.149
jealously declaring: ‘Anyone who loves
their father or mother’

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:58.470
‘more than me is not worthy of me;’

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.480
‘anyone who loves their son or daughter’

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.370
’more than me is not worthy of me.’

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.060
This ‘love on demand’ approach also featured

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.720
in Jesus’s command to ‘love our enemies’

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.240
as well as countless commands to love Yahweh

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.420
employing inducements and threats
to achieve compliance.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.699
The notion of ordering people to love

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.480
denies the autonomous nature of love.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.420
Who today would accept being told
who they should love?

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.620
Talking of relationships, the term codependency

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.880
refers to relationships in which one partner

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.340
depends on the other as an external source

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.140
of self-worth, approval and identity

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.680
instead of being able to nurture those qualities
within themselves.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.420
Codependency is recognised

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.540
as a highly dysfunctional relationship model.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.860
But it’s the ultimate relationship model

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.079
in Jewish and Christian scripture

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.040
where it becomes theodependency.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.540
Here, again, instead of being inwardly cultivated

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.910
self-worth, approval and identity are sought

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.680
from an external source

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.529
—&nbsp;this time, a god —

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:03.399
leaving many followers vulnerable

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.620
to all kinds of abuse and manipulation.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.360
The doctrine of eternal punishment

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.240
promoted by Christianity is deeply immoral

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.580
representing the most extreme possible disproportion

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.000
between transgression and penalty.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.860
By ruling out redemption or rehabilitation,

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.320
it constitutes nothing more than everlasting
gratuitous sadism.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.799
The foundational Christian doctrine
of vicarious redemption

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.100
proposes that the sacrifice of a supposedly
innocent individual

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.120
can atone for the sins of others.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.519
Secular thinkers have denounced this concept

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.820
as a striking perversion of moral responsibility.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.020
Born in the 1700s, Thomas Paine,

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.400
one of the founding fathers
of the United States, commented:

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.360
‘If I owe a person money,
and cannot pay him’

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.100
‘and he threatens to put me in prison‘

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.740
’another person can take the debt upon himself,
and pay it for me.’

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.700
‘But if I have committed a crime’

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.520
‘every circumstance of the case is changed.’

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.340
‘Moral justice cannot take the innocent
for the guilty’

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.840
‘even if the innocent would offer itself.’

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.920
‘To suppose justice to do this’

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.740
‘is to destroy the principle of its existence’

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.980
‘which is the thing itself.’

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.560
‘It is then no longer justice.’

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.980
‘It is indiscriminate revenge.’

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.540
In his book, God Created Humanism:

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.299
The Christian Basis of Secular Values

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:34.380
Theo Hobson seeks to give Christianity credit

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.290
for modern moral thinking. He argues:

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.960
‘Secular humanism very gradually emerged
within Christian culture.’

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.560
‘Which means that the modern humanist principles’

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.140
‘of liberty and equality are rooted in Christianity.’

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:54.440
If self-worth very gradually emerges
from within an abusive family

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.480
is that self-worth rooted in abuse?

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.520
If science very gradually emerges
within a culture

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.320
that rejects science for superstition

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.240
is science rooted in superstition?

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.240
Sometimes values emerge
as an attempt to shake humans

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.220
free of the surrounding culture’s
retrograde influence.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.300
And they emerge despite the best efforts

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.760
of the surrounding culture
to stifle and suppress them.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.340
Hobson states,
‘…. in the mid twentieth century’

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.340
‘the ideal of universal human rights
was launched‘

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.200
’by mostly Christian thinkers and statesmen.’

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.180
A chain of coffee-shops could be launched
by mostly Christian thinkers.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.700
Doesn’t mean the coffee has Christian roots.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.640
Christians do all kinds of things 
—&nbsp;good, bad and indifferent —

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.360
that have nothing to do with their religion.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.160
It’s not enough to say that something was
done by Christians.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.520
In order to give Christianity the credit

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.760
you have to demonstrate a sound ideological
pathway to Christianity itself.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.060
And when we look for that pathway

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.620
we find the problem mentioned before:

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.760
the pathway repeatedly splits
into conflicting directions.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.120
This helps to explain why, historically

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.760
we’ve often seen Christians
on both sides of a dispute.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.620
In the mid-nineteenth century

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.200
on the issue of slavery in the United States

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.960
there were Christian abolitionists
and Christian advocates

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.580
A religion proclaimed as the source
of universal human rights

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:27.060
should unambiguously condemn
the owning of people as property.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.860
But it doesn’t.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.880
Instead, Christian —&nbsp;and Jewish — scripture

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:38.000
explicitly endorses it and even proposes
a set of laws to regulate it.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.820
A religion that stands for everything
stands for nothing.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.720
Hobson writes: ‘Christianity gave rise to
a moral universalism’

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.570
‘that is in a sense more advanced than it’

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.220
‘for secular moral universalism is capable
of being more universalist’

00:19:54.220 --> 00:20:00.620
‘in that it overlooks religious difference
in asserting fundamental human unity.’

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.320
Hobson tries to give the credit for

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.250
the emergence of secular morality to Christianity

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.510
while admitting that secular morality

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.890
in overlooking religious differences

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.770
demonstrates a more advanced moral perspective
than Christianity

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.110
whose doctrines repeatedly exclude and condemn

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.680
those who sincerely see no valid reason

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.940
or evidence for supernatural belief.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.640
Credit for secular moral advances goes to
secular thinkers

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.660
not to Christianity.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.960
The word ‘secular’ is often mistakenly
defined as atheistic.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.420
But secular thinkers can be religious or non-religious.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.500
Secular thinking just means the person isn’t

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.960
bringing religious faith into the matter.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.180
Which is why, in those cases

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.160
credit goes to the thinker
and not to any faith.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.240
He goes on to say, ‘Christianity should
affirm secular humanism’

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.580
‘as a public ideology but also say that
it is inadequate’

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.400
‘it is limited to the practical public sphere,
the surface of life’

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.800
‘it has no strong account
of life’s meaning and purpose’

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.720
‘but gravitates to an evasive shrug.’

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.940
Secular humanism doesn’t have to account

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.540
for life’s ‘meaning’ or ‘purpose’.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.820
Many secular thinkers
don’t agree that life has

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.410
any intrinsic meaning or purpose

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.571
so not providing an account
of these doesn’t represent

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:29.860
a deficiency or an evasion, but a disagreement.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.420
If Hobson wishes to make the claim

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.820
that life has meaning or purpose

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.740
it’s his burden to provide
valid support for his claim.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.700
If he can’t shoulder that burden

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.900
then it’s his position
that amounts to an evasive shrug.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.540
Hobson states, ‘Humanitarian ideals
are not natural’

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.020
‘nor are they rationally deducible’

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.280
‘they are complex cultural traditions,
brewed over centuries.’

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.160
‘And the main ingredient in this brewing
was the story of God’

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.740
‘taking the side, even taking the form,
of the powerless victim….’

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.580
Humanitarianism is about the promotion
of human welfare

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:13.340
and humanitarian ideals can be a mix
of tutored and natural.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.160
As previously noted, we can see
the basic elements

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.560
of empathy and equity
in the prosocial behaviour of animals

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.380
and we have no reason to believe
that humans alone

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.300
require these same elements to be inserted

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.980
magically into them by supernatural means.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.220
Of course ideals do sometimes
require some teaching

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:38.420
often to overcome cultural traditions
brewed over centuries&nbsp;—

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.560
traditions that’ve condemned,
subjugated and executed

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.440
unfathomable numbers of people
based on ignorance, superstition

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.960
and the bogus moral pronouncements
of religious scripture

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.760
like the Jewish and Christian bibles,
which set death penalties

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.560
for a huge range of harmless activities

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.530
including picking up sticks
on the wrong day of the week.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.580
Part of the reason many harmless activities

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.180
were able to be condemned was

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.040
because of the dubious religious term ‘sin’

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.340
which has no accurate secular equivalent.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.180
With sin, we see the invention
of a nebulous category

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.860
that can encompass any behaviour or thought

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.280
on the grounds that it represents

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.240
a transgression against some god or gods

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.510
without having to offer any evidence of harm.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.160
It’s when we apply rational deduction

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.860
— rather than dogmatic
moral pronouncements —

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.220
that we’re able to bypass
all this superstitious savagery

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.040
and see these harmless activities
for what they are.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:42.820
As a former Christian, for years,
I mistook Jesus for a victim.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.500
I became lost in the drama and emotion
of the crucifixion story

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.840
and overwhelmed by the painful sense of guilt

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.480
that was handed to me by my indoctrinators

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.240
who told me Jesus was crucified for me.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.920
When I later tunnelled my way out of my indoctrination

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.160
I realised the character of Jesus
wasn’t a victim at all.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.360
If Jesus was Yahweh in human form

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.620
then Yahweh freely chose to undergo crucifixion

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.820
according to his own premeditated plan.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.660
He had the power to do whatever he wanted.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.980
There was no coercion or necessity.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.160
In contrast, genuine victims
don’t have choice

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.140
or power over their situations.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.880
Being an entirely voluntary exercise

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.940
the crucifixion story amounts to nothing more

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.620
than a divine flirtation with sadomasochism.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:42.780
To characterise Jesus as a victim
is a gross insult to genuine victims.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.000
The claim that people who live their lives

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.860
without any belief in gods,
religion or the supernatural

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.260
have had their morals shaped
by ‘Judeo-Christian’ traditions or values

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.040
can be dismantled on many grounds.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.780
The very notion of Judeo-Christian
traditions and values

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.020
is beset with problems.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.960
Not only do many Jews and Christians

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.620
strongly reject the awkward merging
of their ideologies

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.640
their values and the values
of the individual denominations

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.980
of their religions show significant conflict
and incompatibility.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.860
Individual cases of resemblance
to secular values

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.120
don’t imply that secular values have borrowed
from religion ones.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.000
Secular values can be derived independently

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.120
without reference to any religious scripture.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.140
Animal studies demonstrating basic empathy

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.600
fairness, compassion and reconciliation

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.220
also negate the idea that religions
are the source of our values

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.200
as does the existence
of similar equitable principles

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.960
in independent human cultures around the globe.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.740
Secular moral values can develop
through critical discussion

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.300
allowing course correction
when mistakes are discovered.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.920
Moral judgement relies on an accurate assessment
of relevant information.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.060
So the very principle of adapting in the light
of new information

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.340
rather than sticking dogmatically
to misguided ideas

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.940
is an important value in itself.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.960
In contrast, religious values presented as

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:16.280
eternal, unchanging, perfect…. 
can admit no mistakes

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.810
forcing adherents to invent contorted apologetics

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.410
to try and excuse the inexcusable.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:28.010
Historically, Judaism and Christianity
have both promoted

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:33.300
and implemented scriptural values most of
us find abhorrent today.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.420
Secular thinking has provided moral insights

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.540
and exposed the harm in the values
of those religions

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:43.640
prompting followers to reevaluate
their moral stances on a range of issues

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.140
and opening the way for all of us

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.880
to advance beyond exclusive
religious moral systems

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.340
and continue to develop inclusive human values

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.700
that are relevant and coherent.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.360
Secular thinkers have not borrowed moral capital

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.660
from the incoherent hybrid that is Judeo-Christianity.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.380
We don’t owe Judeo-Christianity a moral debt

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.600
and we shouldn’t put up with any attempts 
on its behalf at appropriating morality.
