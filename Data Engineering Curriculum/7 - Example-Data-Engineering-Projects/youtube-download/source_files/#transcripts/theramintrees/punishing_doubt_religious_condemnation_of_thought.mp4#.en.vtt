00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.360
Doubt is an inevitable part of life for every
one of us.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.400
We experience doubts about ourselves,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.100
about other people and about the ever-changing world around us.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.280
Some doubts are easily resolved; with others,
resolution might seem unattainable.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.680
Some doubts point to significant personal
implications for us;

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680
with others, the implications seem more abstract.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.420
In some cases, we might shy away
from investigating our doubts

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.700
for fear of uncovering realities that seem unbearable.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.160
But generally, we at least feel free to choose
whether or not to investigate.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.979
But sometimes, other people attempt to block
that freedom, condemning the exercise of doubt

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.260
as dangerous, destructive and disloyal.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.780
This practice is observed
in dogmatic, authoritarian ideologies.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.600
Prime examples are found in the realm of religion.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.500
Some Muslim apologists have described doubt
as ‘a disease of the heart’

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.860
and cite passages in their primary text — the Qur’an — stating that true believers have no doubts.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.500
Some Christian apologists have denounced doubt
as a ‘a tool of Satan’

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.460
and cite passages in their primary text —&nbsp;the Bible —

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.360
stating that those who doubt should
expect nothing from their god Yahweh.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.689
Of course, some theists will protest that
they’re completely free to doubt

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.129
and always have armfuls of questions.

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:49.109
Some make themselves out to be
quite the irreverent rebel.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.169
And if they are genuinely free, good for them.

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:56.820
But look closer and you’ll find that many
of these folks aren’t as bold as they like to think.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.960
In fact their questions fit very comfortably
within a tacitly approved list

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.620
of commonly voiced complaints that the
major religions have all developed stock responses for

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.160
— however inadequate or platitudinous
those responses might be.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.660
It’s when you depart from the approved list

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.520
— and the patience and compassion of those around you turn to disapproval and condemnation —

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.840
that the fog begins to clear and the limits imposed
on your freedom become apparent.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.060
Investigating your religious doubts, in the face of prohibition, can feel like walking an intimidating path.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.000
A steep path that might challenge your most deep-rooted preconceptions, your integrity, your stamina.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.880
A rocky path, along which you might experience
criticism, obstruction and abuse from others.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.200
An open-ended path that may — or may not
— seem to offer resolution.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.300
So why take such a path?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.819
That’s what I want to address.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.699
I want to explore this religious condemnation of doubt,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.060
exposing some of the double-standards behind it and the absurdities they lead to,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.820
examining the emotional blackmail that leaves some feeling guilty or disloyal for entertaining doubts,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.220
and explaining the very real dangers involved
when faith is unrestrained by doubt.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.840
When Abraham said: ‘Show me, Lord, how you
will raise the dead,’

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.229
He replied: ‘Have you no faith?’

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.560
He said ‘Yes, but just to reassure my heart.’

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.380
Allah said, ‘Take four birds, draw them
to you, and cut their bodies to pieces.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.600
‘Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then
call them back.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.420
‘They will come swiftly to you.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.920
Know that Allah is mighty, wise.’

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.720
This strange encounter, described in surah
2, verse 260 of the Qur’an,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.360
illustrates a common religious double standard.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.380
Whether it be major world religions like Islam
and Christianity,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.740
or pocket-sized doomsday groups
claiming to channel aliens from distant planets,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.720
we see the same old division.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.860
There are the chosen ones, deemed worthy of
supernatural proof,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.780
and the undeserving hoi polloi,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.780
the common masses who are simultaneously
denied knowledge but commanded not to doubt

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.620
— a double-bind that produces
acute psychological tensions.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.710
Let’s pick apart some of the layers of problems
with this elitist system.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.730
In ‘Towards Understanding the Qur’an’,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.720
Islamic scholar Abul Ala Maududi defends Abraham’s request for a divine demonstration,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.580
explaining that Abraham is looking for the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.720
‘inner peace that one attains as a result of direct personal observation’.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.120
This is a striking acknowledgement of the
inadequacy of faith.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.960
Think of it.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.360
Here we have Abraham,&nbsp;a religious character so iconic

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.960
that Islam, Christianity and Judiasm are collected
under his name as the Abrahamic religions;

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.940
a figure who, according to this story,
even converses directly with Allah.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.400
And still he needs the kind of reassurance that could only come from a demonstration of divine power.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.920
So, why is he granted the peace of mind
that’s denied to ordinary believers?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.380
Maududi’s answer is that: ‘.... the kind of function
that ordinary believers are required to perform

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.940
‘requires of them no more than believing in certain truths without perceiving them through their senses.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.220
‘The function entrusted by [Allah] to the Prophets

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.720
'is such that they ought to have
direct knowledge of the truths.’

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.920
Maududi argues that the prophets had to tell
the world they spoke from direct experience,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.220
possessing reliable information that set them apart from others who employed conjecture, fancy and imagination.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.340
The problem is, even if their experience was genuine,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.300
it would do precisely nothing
to set them apart.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.440
Imagine six prophets who each claim
they’ve been given a guided tour of hell.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.800
These could be the hells of established religions
like Greek religion, Buddhism, Zoroastrianiasm,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.420
or hells as yet unimagined.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.900
For argument’s sake, let’s imagine
one of them speaks from direct experience.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.400
How would you determine which one that was?

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.880
This is a supernatural realm we’re talking about.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.880
By definition, it defies all of our experience
and frameworks of reference.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.480
The fact is we have no criteria for assessing
the reliability of this information.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.920
Direct experience doesn’t set people apart

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.420
because the act of recounting a direct experience transforms it into another currency.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.420
It now becomes a story, an unsubstantiated claim.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.840
This instantly nullifies its evidential value.
Nothing is proved by an unsubstantiated claim.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.800
To restore its value, substantiation is required.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.980
But that’s the very thing denied to the common people.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.040
Obviously, if you want to play dirty

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.420
you can get the common people
to accept your revelation claims

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.420
by manipulation rather than substantiation.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.200
You just drill it into them, from birth if
possible, that your religion is perfect

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.640
while others are corrupt.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.840
You fill their minds with visions of dreamy rewards
and nightmarish punishments.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.360
And you make doubt a thought-crime.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.780
The end result is generally a pleasingly compliant devotee who’ll swallow all your unsubstantiated claims

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.160
while scoffing at those of other religions.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.660
The problem is while you’re busy manipulating
people into your religion

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.180
other folks are manipulating people into theirs

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.840
creating followers who’ll favour their revelation stories and become impervious to yours.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.080
Which leads us to a deeper problem.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.320
Divine characters like Allah and Yahweh are
conceptualised as all-knowing.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.420
If they existed, they’d know that people
indoctrinated into other religions

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.240
are generally immune to all but
their own religion’s revelation stories.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.100
They would therefore also know that to get
through to those people in other religions,

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.490
a much more powerful method of persuasion
was needed than revelation stories

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.870
— ie proof that has the power to transcend
all religious biases and barriers.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.250
Proof that has the power to reach every individual.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.160
For all the centuries of lip-flapping
about all-powerful gods

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.360
not one single religion has produced the goods.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.750
By an astounding coincidence

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.960
every single one of them has instead required
their followers to take their word for it.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.700
So, in the absence of proof, what do we have?

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.340
Here we come the biggest problem so far.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.000
Taking just Islam and Christianity, in both cases

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.760
we have a divine character who’s
content to do nothing

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.680
while millions of human beings,
through no fault or desire of their own

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.200
are indoctrinated into other faiths.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.260
It knows that this indoctrination will create
powerful biases in those humans

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.540
immunising them against its religion.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.900
It then watches as these humans descend
to unspeakable torment in hell

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.400
as punishment for not believing.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.140
What we’re talking about is a holocaust bystander.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.780
To describe this behaviour as ‘callous’
limboes beneath understatement.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.000
But what I want to highlight is its sheer stupidity.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.920
Imagine the following situation.
You’re a night security guard for an apartment block.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.440
You’re stationed in a small hut attached to the block

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.280
with CCTV screens and speaker access to all areas.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.120
There’s a fire in the building that forces
everyone down to a basement area

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.160
where they find a red door and a yellow door.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.140
They debate which one to take.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.020
They can hear traffic noises behind the yellow door.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.300
But then someone sees the faded word ‘EXIT’
above the red door.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.640
The group becomes sharply divided
into Reds and Yellows

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.800
each rejecting the arguments of the other.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.520
You watch all of this on your CCTV screen,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.660
knowing that the red door leads to freedom

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.120
while the yellow door leads
to a dead-end and certain death.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.460
There’s a vent next to your desk
connected to a vent in the basement.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.120
You can see that one of the Reds is standing near it.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.900
If you shout down the vent ‘Take the red door’

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:26.200
she’ll just about hear you and she’ll report
receiving advice from a disembodied voice.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.800
You know the Reds are already predisposed to believe her.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.360
But you also know the Yellows will easily
dismiss this ridiculous ghostly message.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.080
Alternatively, you could use
the public address system at your disposal

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.240
to give an announcement over the basement speakers that’ll be clearly heard by everyone

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:49.640
identifying yourself as the guard from the security hut and telling them to take the red door.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.360
So, do you choose the vent or the PA system?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.400
Allah and Yahweh chose the vent.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.920
I’ve said it before.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.360
All-knowing gods should be geniuses.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.580
But the ill-conceived system of private revelation employed by prophet-based religions

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.740
has the grubby fingerprints
of limited human thinking all over it.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.180
If you want to overcome the doubts of serious thinkers

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.660
you seriously need to up your game.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.360
Many religious people suffer with
tremendous guilt about their doubts.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.880
— guilt that’s often inspired and reinforced by others

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.360
In his book ‘God in the dark: The assurance
of faith beyond a shadow of doubt’,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.980
Christian author Os Guinness identifies nine kinds of doubt that he suggests lead people out of faith

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.020
all of which put the blame
squarely on the doubter.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.760
He talks about doubt from ingratitude,
from a faulty view of his god Yahweh,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.440
from weak foundations, from lack of commitment, 
from lack of growth, from unruly emotion,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.220
from hidden conflicts, from inquisitiveness 
and from impatience.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.380
The possibility that doubt could come from
inconsistencies is dogmatically dismissed.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.620
Scare-mongering imagery is used throughout the book.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.700
For example, a nameless doubt
is compared to a ‘waiting shark’

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.820
that ‘lurks below the conscious mind’

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.960
with ‘no limit to its shadowy potential for destruction’.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.540
Guinness warns that preoccupation with doubt
holds ‘much danger’

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.200
comparing it to preoccupation with sickness.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.880
But preoccupation in both these areas
can lead to positive outcomes.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.560
With sickness, preoccupation can lead to effective treatments.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:35.920
With doubt, preoccupation can expose deception,
expand our knowledge and free us from tyranny.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.260
Later on, I’ll be talking about
the dangers of not doubting

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.760
and I won’t be resorting to hyperbole,
but offering real-life examples.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.060
All these criticisms of religious doubters
are ones many of us have heard before.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.880
The charge of ingratitude was levelled at me
when I expressed my own religious doubts as a child.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.800
I pled — and still plead — not guilty.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.960
It wasn’t that I became ungrateful.
I was just putting my gratitude where it belonged.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.800
For instance, after the recovery of loved
ones from life-threatening accidents or illness,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.380
while some folks have busied themselves telling
everyone about the thanks they gave to their god.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.540
you would’ve found me thanking
the doctors and nurses.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.760
You know? The folks who actually saved
those lives, with their knowledge and dedication.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.380
Sometimes a sense of gratitude can be experienced
without the need to direct it towards any agent

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.280
real or imagined.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.140
When I’m filling the kettle or standing under the shower,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.640
I’m intensely mindful of the fact that access
to running water is a tremendous luxury

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.680
unknown to vast numbers of humans.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.620
When I’m sprinting, either to make up time
or for the sheer joy of it

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.540
I feel deep appreciation for the physical mobility I enjoy.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.160
And when I experience doubt —&nbsp;even crushing doubt —

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.980
I treasure my fundamental freedom
to think for myself.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.640
For many folks, doubts about their religion
get stirred up by distressing life events

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.300
involving illness, loss, injustice, death.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:07.080
At these times, when many cry out ‘Why, Oh Lord?’
and crave robust answers

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.120
it seems all religions have to offer
is a welter of mimsy platitudes.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.620
People are told: ‘God doesn’t give us
anything we can’t handle.’

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.400
In rebuttal, one word: suicide.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.420
When people take their own lives to escape
some anguish

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.720
whether that anguish comes from chronic pain, relentless bullying, insufferable loss

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.620
or an inability to construct a future

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.180
they have, by definition, been given more
than they could handle.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.440
People are told: ‘God doesn’t give you the people
you want. He gives you the people you need.’

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.580
In rebuttal, again one word: pedophile.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.560
Is anyone seriously going to argue

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.100
that their god gave sexually-abused children the paedophiles they needed?

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:54.380
Guinness characterises the question ‘Why, Oh Lord?’
as ‘doubt from impatient inquisitiveness’

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.300
and puts the doubter’s need to know
down to a lack of trust.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.060
A damning accusation.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.800
But does it stand up?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.300
Leaving gods aside, let’s consider
our real relationships with other humans

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.980
specifically, with the people we most trust in the world.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.360
When we ask them questions
about their actions and intentions,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.740
does that mean that we’re impatiently inquisitive,
or that we lack trust in them?

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.060
Of course not.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.480
In fact, very often it’s when we trust people most deeply

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.800
that we feel most confident about
approaching them with troubling inconsistencies.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.120
We trust that they’ll understand the genuine
concern behind our questions.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.820
We trust they’ll be able and willing to
clear things up.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.680
But most of all we trust that they won’t
respond with abuse and emotional blackmail,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.860
accusing us of lacking trust.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:48.000
In fact, it’s when people behave in these defensive
and attacking ways that alarms bells start ringing.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.840
The tragedy isn’t that Christian doubters
lack trust,&nbsp;but often that they have so much trust.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.920
Religious apologists might try to whip up
all kinds of scare-mongering rhetoric

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.260
and emotional blackmail to make doubts seem shameful and dangerous.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.240
But doubt is a perfectly healthy response

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.140
when we perceive problems
in the information we’re working with

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.520
and there’s no reason to feel guilty
for wanting to address those problems.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.860
As for danger, that comes not when we start
to doubt, but when we stop doubting.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.350
HBO’s documentary ‘Mea Maxima Culpa 
— Silence in the House of God’

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.690
showed how religious suppression
of doubt played several key roles

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.190
in the perpetuation of child sexual abuse by Catholic priests.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:34.980
For some victims, the status of the priest as a divine agent put his motives and actions beyond doubt.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.840
They therefore accepted the abuse,
figuring they must deserve it.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:44.360
Other victims who did seek help found it was the adults they confided in — from parents to police —

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.900
who refused to doubt the ‘holy fathers’.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.100
It’s hard for some folks to grasp
the height of the pedestal

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.240
on which the Catholic clergy
were placed in these cases.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.140
Ordained priests were considered
to be transformed into semi-divine humans.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.620
One victim of Roman Catholic priest Alexander Walsh

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.360
reportedly believed he was being touched
by the hand of god.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.960
Priests are attributed with the divine power
of transubstantiation —

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.560
the purported ability to turn wafers and wine into the body and blood of the Christian messiah Jesus.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.380
In some cases, consecrated wafers were reportedly
pressed against the genitals of victims.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:26.180
Priests are also attributed with the power
to grant absolution, the forgiveness of mortal sins.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.680
Some priests used absolution as divine justification for their crimes

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.100
claiming they were taking
the children’s sins on themselves.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:40.280
Absolution could also be used in a more coercive
way, by being withheld if victims didn’t submit.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.160
The church’s aversion to doubt
also played a more far-reaching role.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.140
In a scandal that alienated countless Catholics,

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.380
it was discovered that the Vatican had long
known

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.960
about the endemic problem
of child sexual abuse within its ranks.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.760
Like the Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.000
a religious organisation that also sees itself
as above the reach of worldly laws

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.260
and has maintained a secret database of known and suspected pedophiles within its membership,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:11.020
the Catholic church also had extensively documented knowledge of offenders which it concealed for years.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:16.339
Victims might be privately paid off, sworn
to secrecy

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.779
even coerced into signing official apologies for
the true allegations made against their abusers

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.320
under threat of excommunication.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.420
Why?

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.400
To preserve unquestioning trust in the church.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.480
To suppress doubt.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.280
Some apologists assert that Yahweh has nothing
to do with this unholy mess;

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.160
that these are human acts
for which he’s unaccountable.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.740
But Yahweh isn’t so easily absolved.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.700
We come back to elitism.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.660
According to the Bible, Jesus chose to spread his word

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.080
not through an egalitarian system
of universal revelation to every individual,

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:56.170
but through an elitist system of specially
appointed agents called disciples.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:03.610
The Catholic clergy — from priest to bishop
to pope — continues this legacy of discipleship.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:10.150
In Luke 10 verse 16, Jesus tells the disciples:
‘Whoever listens to you listens to me’.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:15.230
More pointedly he continues: ‘.... whoever
rejects you rejects me’.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:20.990
And just to really drive the point home, he
adds that whoever rejects him rejects Yahweh.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:27.630
So, cutting out the middle Messiah, reject
Yahweh’s disciples and you reject Yahweh.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.570
By introducing this system of elite disciples

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.660
that the common people are directed to trust
as Yahweh’s representatives,

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.840
Yahweh becomes implicated in any abuses
that result from the misuse of that trust.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.600
And as an all-knowing god,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.180
able to foresee every abuse that would result
from this elitist system

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.900
he has no escape hatch.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.060
If he existed, he would absolutely be accountable.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.440
Child sexual abuse occurs in all kinds of institutions.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.660
But the religious suppression of doubt

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:03.360
has given priests a level of immunity
other sexual predators could only dream of

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.280
allowing some to prey
on hundreds of children over decades

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.340
under the protection of a church more concerned with its holy reputation than the suffering of its victims.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.260
Guinness conceptualised
a nameless doubt as a ‘waiting shark’

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.520
with ‘no limit to its shadowy potential for destruction’.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.880
But doubt isn’t the shark.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.220
Doubt is what allows us
to spot the sharks around us:

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:33.900
the deceivers, the manipulators and the abusers
who thrive in spaces that suppress doubt.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.620
Doubt can sometimes put us in a spin.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.160
But lack of doubt leaves us
vulnerable to the spin of others.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.220
The hollow metaphors, the deflections, the doublespeak

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.860
and the emotional blackmail of those who wish
to forcibly confine us in their ideology

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.840
rather than try to persuade us respectfully.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.980
Doubt is the the path out of that confinement.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.520
Ideologies that demand
their followers neither know nor doubt

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.680
put those followers in
an impossible psychological position,

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.300
denying them both certainty and uncertainty.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.920
Sadly, there are still many parts of the world

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.700
where voicing doubts will attract officially condoned punishments up to and including execution.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.820
They might silence some of our mouths,
but we should never let them silence our minds.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.280
‘To find yourself, think for yourself’

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:28.440
This quote, attributed to Socrates, reminds
us that when we allow others to think for us

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:35.240
what we’ll find in our heads are their ideas,
their perceptions, their experiences, their beliefs

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.300
in place of our own.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.580
To find ourselves, we need
to exercise our freedom to think

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.980
and resist ideologies that try to block that freedom
by punishing doubt.
