00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.651
Escaping an abusive environment

00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:30.410
— an abusive relationship, family,
or ideological group —

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.700
can draw deeply on your well of inner resources.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.340
Your patience, your resilience, your integrity

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.620
your determination, your ego.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.559
All of these can be severely tested

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.820
as you disentangle yourself from an elaborate
nexus of false ideas.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.520
Unfortunately, the poison can go a lot deeper
than we think.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.640
As we move on with our lives, we don’t realise

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.080
some of the malignancy we thought
we’d gotten rid of

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.780
has hitched a ride with us.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.820
Without knowing it, we can find ourselves

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.760
copying some of the destructive behaviour
we thought we’d left behind.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.220
It’s understandable.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.200
In abusive environments, unhealthy behaviour
gets normalised.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.800
We learn from bad examples.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.780
We also develop distorted coping strategies
to deal with the abuse.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.420
Ways of shutting down and protecting ourselves.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.540
Sometimes we carry these strategies over into
our new relationships

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.300
not realising how destructive they are,
or how they echo our abusers’ behaviour.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.580
For many former targets of abuse

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.860
the idea that they’re copying their abusers
in any way is repugnant.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.800
But later I’ll be looking at how apparently
opposing mindsets

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.340
can sometimes produce
similar destructive behaviour.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.120
Copying our enemies can have significant knock-on
effects in a few distinct areas.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.280
It can affect our ability to grow as an individual.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.870
It can affect how we relate to other escapees

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.940
who’ve made it out of abusive environments

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.490
and how we relate to the people who remain
inside abusive environments

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.260
including the ways we might try to open their
eyes to the abuse.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.020
I want to explore all these areas.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.160
To give that exploration context

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760
I want to briefly reflect on how we get
drawn into abuse

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.840
and how we escape from it.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.200
Some people are born into abuse.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.520
Some submit to it in their adulthood.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.180
The goal’s the same at any age.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.639
Whether they come in the form of partners,
family members or members of ideological groups

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.040
abusers aim to get us to accept their distorted
version of reality uncritically as the truth.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.180
Over time, child and adult targets have their
individuality progressively suppressed.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.639
Acts of independence are met with shaming
or punishment

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.760
so that targets come to associate individuality
with guilt or fear.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.880
They’re trained not to trust their own senses
and critical reasoning.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.040
They’re taught instead to seek
external validation from their abusers

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.440
who, in effect, become their dealers,
controlling their supply of self-worth.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.400
Abusive systems all push the same message:

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.400
that a sense of worth is only valid
if it’s supplied by other people

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.700
and that when we try to supply our own self-worth

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.040
it’s an inferior corrupted product.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.579
Eventually, targets become fully-fledged actors
on their abusers’ stage

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.520
sticking rigidly to the script
their abusers give them.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.040
Even though they’ve been transformed
almost beyond recognition

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.740
remnants of their former selves remain,
albeit deeply suppressed.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.299
Even people indoctrinated as very young children

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.419
can sometimes later remember
that brief period in childhood

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.180
when they first started thinking for themselves

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.140
and when they felt no concern
about asking awkward questions.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.180
They remember how silly the answers sounded

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.620
and how they felt free to say so.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.200
But then the punishment kicked in hard
and the laughing stopped.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.980
And their connection to that authentic individual
they used to be

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.460
gradually faded from view as they became
immersed in their abuser’s script.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.680
For some of us, that connection
with our authentic selves eventually returns.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.140
It happens differently for each person.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.160
It could be discovering
a question we can’t answer

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.780
a logical contradiction, a hypocrisy, a lie.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.880
It could be seeing people mistreated with
an extremity we weren’t prepared for

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.660
or finding unexpected allies in people we’d
previously been turned against by our abusers.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.940
And so on.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.800
Whatever it is, we realise
there’s a serious problem

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.380
with the version of reality we’ve been handed.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.700
For some folks, the spell is instantly broken.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.360
For others, the process can take
weeks, months, years.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.520
But it’s begun. We’ve identified that
there’s a problem.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.720
Some of us will try to solve it ourselves
— only to find more problems.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.020
We begin to see some of the massive distortions

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.300
used to hold the abuser’s
false reality together.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.520
Without realising it, we’ve kick-started
our independent thinking.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.720
We’ve begun to lean on our own understanding

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.100
to validate our own experience.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.260
Part of our long-suppressed individuality
is waking up.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.740
Many of us make an understandable mistake.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.960
We consult other members of the abusive system.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.060
But chances are, from their angle, the only
thing that seems off is us.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.120
They’ll assume the fault is with us
and explain to us

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.600
how we need to approach the problem
from another direction.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.560
If your problem is that your father is tearing
your family apart with malicious attacks

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.360
you might be told to focus on
everything he’s done for you.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.600
If your problem is that the religion you were
taught to believe

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.180
was all about love is full of promises of
sadistic torture

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.770
you might be told to trust that there must
be good reasons for that torture

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.320
even if you can’t understand them.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.939
If your problem is that the group you believed
was fighting for equality

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.250
is routinely perpetrating gross inequalities

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.760
you might be told some people
are more equal than others.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.479
By consulting our fellow members,
we’re seeking answers from the wrong people.

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.780
To be able to comprehend
the problem we’re presenting

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.920
they would have to go off-script.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.680
Chances are they can’t.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.040
It can be extremely isolating when we start
going against the abuser’s script.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.780
We can forget how powerful its grip can be.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.580
When we share our concerns, we’re repeatedly
met with blank faces

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.920
and treated as if we’re the problem.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.500
As we investigate deeper
darker layers of problems

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.090
it can feel like we get blanked out completely

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.080
as if we’re speaking another language.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.960
Although our concerns are met with silence,
avoidance and denial

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.539
sometimes we’ll later find out we did get
through to some people

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.440
who began to look around at what they’d
been accepting and open their eyes.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.719
Things come into a whole new focus for them

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.600
when they begin to see the problems we’re
pointing out.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.880
But seeing the truth doesn’t mean
they’ll take action.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.460
For them, action might risk levels of discomfort
or loss they’re not ready for.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.120
Instead, they might choose to go along with
the false reality

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.620
and try and find ways to minimise
the problems they saw.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.900
They might tell themselves
that every group has its flaws.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.860
Which is true.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.280
But not every group condones and enables abuse.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.420
Critics don’t last long in abusive environments.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.800
The choice tends to be stark. Comply or leave.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.660
Sometimes the choice is made for us when we
get formally discarded and shunned.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.560
Even though it’s an abusive situation,
leaving can be tough.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.120
We sometimes have to work through
lots of emotions

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.180
and let go of powerful fantasies
that things can be fixed;

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.120
that there’s always hope for change.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.700
These are just forms of denial and bargaining.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.700
Eventually we accept that the abuse
is going to continue.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.040
When we leave an abusive situation

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.380
the ground ahead can seem patchy
and shaky at the start.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.900
But gradually it begins to fill out.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.500
We begin to walk around more confidently
in our new free terrain.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.840
Our life slowly begins to find
some shape again.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.240
But sometimes progress
suddenly seems to stop.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.620
We can find ourselves getting tangled up
in old familiar patterns.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.920
Sometimes we’re dealing with
what are called ‘fleas’.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.560
The term comes from the phrase

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.600
‘When you lie down with dogs,
you get up with fleas’.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.240
Fleas are the maladaptive habits and traits

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.920
we’ve picked up from the abusive environment

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.080
and they vary from person to person.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.340
An example of a flea might be triangulation.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.020
Triangulation is a manipulative strategy
used by abusers

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.420
where a third party is used to play people
off against each other.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.460
Targets might have their achievements negatively
compared with someone else.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.680
An abuser might stir up conflict
between two targets

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.060
by falsely reporting that they’ve made nasty
comments about each other.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.160
Triangulation can be a messy
and destructive business.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.460
But after they’ve escaped their abusers

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.200
targets sometimes find themselves using triangulation

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.960
not maliciously, but because they feel powerless.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.060
Direct interactions might still arouse too
much vulnerability.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.960
Indirect methods can feel safer.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.740
Instead of dealing with relationship problems
assertively

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.680
they might resort to bringing in other people
to defend them, muddying the waters.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.220
Instead of being direct
about their attraction to someone

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.500
they might resort to triangulation by using
a third party to try and arouse jealousy.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.780
Even though there’s no malicious intention

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.460
the triangulated party can still feel
betrayed or manipulated.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.380
When targets of abuse learn to express

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.210
their complaints, their needs and their desires directly

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.760
the urge to triangulate will fall away.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.920
Another flea is emotional volatility.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.540
Targets of persistent abuse have often had
to suppress powerful instincts

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.740
instincts to defend themselves,
to fight, to escape.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.340
Many targets try to suppress their own thoughts

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.460
because they’ve been taught
to believe in thoughtcrime.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.700
Abusive environments are also full
of unacknowledged emotions.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.360
Targets learn to suppress unacceptable feelings.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.440
Which feelings are considered unacceptable
will vary from group to group

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.100
but anger is commonly forbidden.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.820
In healthy situations, emotions like anger
have a volume control

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.340
rising from annoyance to rage
in graduated degrees.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.200
In abusive situations, because anger
is squashed down

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.800
it becomes more like an on-off switch.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.120
Targets’ anger can emerge
in sudden destructive flashes

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.640
just like they did with their abusers.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.080
Other examples of fleas include avoiding accountability

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.000
hypersensitivity to criticism
and trouble with boundaries.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.920
In their abusers, these traits come from
a place of entitlement.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.280
In targets, these traits arise in response
to excessive punishment

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.960
and being shown no healthy respect for their
possessions, privacy and personal space.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.800
When targets see themselves
acting like their abusers

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.200
they often feel mortified and wonder if they’ve
become the thing they despise.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.500
But the fact they feel mortified
shows they haven’t.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.320
Their abusers don’t feel remorse.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.800
All of these hangovers from the abusive environment

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.630
can have a negative impact on future relationships
and personal development.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.900
But identifying them is the first step
to recovery.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.900
All of these anxious habits can be replaced
with healthier responses

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:47.100
with time, awareness and education
about the after-effects of abuse.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.980
Copying enemies can become an issue in our
relationships with other escapees.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.220
In October 2012, I read a newspaper article

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.660
by an ex-Scientologist called Martin Padfield.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.020
He was promoting a conference
a few miles away that day

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.500
called ‘The Cult in Your Backyard’.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.920
I hadn’t heard much about Scientology
back then so I drove along.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.780
I learned that the Scientology organisation
was a pseudoscientific high-control group

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.600
one that shares a number of parallels

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.140
with the religious high-control group,
the Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.140
These include the official promotion
of deceptive tactics

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.780
against outsiders including secular authorities

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.580
and the practice of shunning former members.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.140
I asked the panelists at the conference what
initially attracted them to Scientology.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.840
Hearing their stories back to back underscored
what a diverse bunch they were

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:48.040
in their backgrounds, their experiences and
their attitudes to Scientology.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.340
Some panelists were still holding onto the
central belief system

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.800
practicing Scientology as independent agents.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.980
One practicing panelist
appeared to believe claims

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.580
that some Scientologists had manifested abilities

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.920
like rolling a pencil across a table without
touching it and seeing through walls.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.360
Another panelist claimed
she could leave her body at will.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.760
On the other end of the spectrum

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.920
other panelists were unreservedly scathing
about Scientology’s claims

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.720
including the supposed powers
it was said to confer

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.740
like telekinesis and mastery over illness.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.440
They viewed Scientology as intrinsically damaging

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.700
and disapproved of it in all its forms —
independent or corporate.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.880
What was striking was the respect all of these
ex-members showed each other.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.000
Despite irreconcilable differences
in their positions

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.660
the panel — and the audience — were all
able to express themselves

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.520
without fear of censorship.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.600
There was no coercion, no silencing of opinions,
no personal attacks.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.900
No suppressive persons.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.500
What united the panelists was their focused
condemnation of abuse.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.600
It was a great example of what a mature atmosphere
of free expression could be.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.220
As we all know, relationships between escapees

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.460
from abusive groups aren’t always so smooth.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.040
Some people get condemned for being
too soft and forgiving.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.760
Some are condemned for being
too hard-line and unforgiving.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.040
But what really burns
is when escapees start using

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.060
the abusive tactics of their former group
on each other.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.980
At the ‘Cult in Your Backyard’ conference,
one panelist, John McGhee

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.420
noted that sometimes independent Scientologists

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.680
who’d broken away from the organisation

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.500
still engaged in the practice of shunning,
known as disconnection.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.960
To know the pain of shunning simply for disagreeing

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.500
and then inflict it on others simply for disagreeing

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.700
is an extremely sad example
of copying the enemy.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.380
Some folks I’ve spoken with
have left abusive groups

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.980
that had fixed hierarchical structures

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.400
dividing members into elite
and subordinate subgroups.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.520
Having hoped to find an open, egalitarian
community of ex-members

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.300
they’ve reported experiencing a similar
hierarchical vibe

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.500
from some of their fellow escapees.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.440
There’s a sense that some people have carried
their former roles with them.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.100
It can feel like they’ve jumped
out the frying pan

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.880
into a slightly smaller frying pan.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.340
And it can spark a lot of distressing memories.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:21.580
Sometimes people copy their enemies in insidious
ways that might seem positive at first

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.560
but their coercive style is a clue
that something else is going on.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.440
Some former targets of abuse try to push other
former targets to forgive their abusers.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.780
They continue to press the point, even when
their advice is repeatedly declined.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.420
They argue and insist and pressurise.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.600
They insinuate that a lack of forgiveness
shows some moral deficiency

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.300
or that it’ll somehow backfire
on the unforgiving individual.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:54.160
These are some of the same manipulations
abusers use to extract forgiveness.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.600
These echoes of our abusers are depressing
but understandable.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.020
When we’ve been exposed to certain behaviour
for an extended period

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.680
it becomes a familiar reference model.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.280
Sometimes, without thinking, we fall back
on what feels familiar.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.720
While it’s understandable, it’s important
to recognise these abusive practices

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.300
and to do what we can to eradicate them.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.400
Every time we mindfully reject
the degrading practices

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.560
of our former abusive environments

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.240
we flush out more of the last remnants
of their poison.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.060
Copying enemies can become an issue in our
dealings with our former abusive groups.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.580
Our interactions with them can arouse
a lot of emotions.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.600
To feel anger is perfectly natural.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.880
Some people are against expressing it.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.960
For me the expression of anger in itself
isn’t the problem.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.460
Anger’s healthy and appropriate
when it’s focused on the abuse

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.800
like it was in the Scientology conference.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.160
But it becomes destructive when we begin
to vent wildly and indiscriminately

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.040
attacking innocent individuals who we lump
together with the abusive elements.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.140
Sometimes whole demographics are demonised.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.000
We attack the body instead of the tumour.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.160
The bullied can become bullies,
in the guise of champions.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.520
Thinking of themselves as rescuers
who stand for justice

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.000
they drift into a persecutor position,
actively perpetrating injustice.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.180
Unfocussed anger helps no one —
including ourselves.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.060
Because we can plainly see the false reality
that underpins our old group

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.920
it can feel surreal watching members figuratively
walking around on thin air

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.900
making assertions with nothing to stand on.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.500
Of course from their angle the ground beneath
us can seem just as insubstantial

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.600
as it once did to us.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.380
Getting to a place where both parties can
hear each other can be a delicate process.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.120
It helps if we’re clear about exactly what
we’re trying to achieve.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.800
Why are we doing this?

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.840
To feel better about ourselves?

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.420
To score points?

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.960
Do we want to rip individuals
out of the group at any cost?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.220
Around ten years ago,
an atheist YouTuber told me

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.700
he and some other atheists had held one of
their theist friends captive for several hours

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.600
subjecting him to intense questioning and
refutation over the existence of his god.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.180
He said they succeeded in de-converting
his friend to atheism

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.700
although his friend reported
a great sense of bleakness.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.000
The YouTuber predicted I probably wouldn’t
approve of their method

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.820
but emphasised that it worked.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.400
He was right. I was horrified.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.060
I was horrified because it was done to me
— only in reverse.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.600
There was a time in my childhood
when I was backing out

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.970
of the religion I’d been indoctrinated into.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.660
But I was forced to stay against my will.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.260
Feeling powerless, I surrendered to a kind
of Stockholm syndrome reaction

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.710
embracing a dogmatic ideology
I felt imprisoned by.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.740
I was broken.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.000
Coercive tactics like these have been turned
into a career by some folks.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.300
Born in 1930, Ted Patrick became famous as
a professional deprogrammer

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:13.080
working to break the undue influence of abusive
groups on individuals.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.060
Relatives of targets who’d been recruited
by religious high-control groups

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.540
would approach him to help
rescue their loved ones.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.240
Although Patrick’s intentions were positive

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.200
his methods were extremely controversial.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.590
He’d arrange forcible abductions

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.340
and hold targets against their will
in a secure location.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.840
Family members were brought in

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.420
to appeal to the target to come back to them.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.380
It could be an emotionally chaotic environment

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.820
in which parents were free
to subject their targets

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.620
to threats, mockery and tearful guilt trips.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.080
Although Patrick’s interventions did produce
a few success stories

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.700
many of them backfired

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.080
driving individuals back to their abusers

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.640
with their defences now sky-high.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.360
Steven Hassan, a former recruit
of the Unification Church

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.880
otherwise known as the Moonies

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.980
has also made it his life’s work

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.380
to combat the undue influence
of high-control groups.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.100
Although he’s admitted to sometimes
arranging to meet recruits

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.340
under a slightly deceptive pretext

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.520
his methods differ substantially from Patrick’s.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.480
Recruits come freely
and can leave at any time.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.960
They’re simply presented
with detailed accurate information

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.170
about the group they’ve become
involved with

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.280
and allowed to make up their own minds.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.860
If the information prods that
suppressed individual awake —&nbsp;great.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.600
But even if targets go back
to their abusive groups

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.440
they’re not left with distressing memories
of being abducted.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.060
And the accurate information
they’ve been given

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.780
might start to chime
with their experiences in the group.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.160
They’ve been empowered.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.640
For me, this reflects the prime goal.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.340
It’s not about making people think
what we want them to think.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.720
That’s exactly what abusers do.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:02.260
It’s about empowering people with the tools
to think for themselves.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.880
I wasn’t dragged out of the abusive groups
I’ve found myself in.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:11.140
I walked out by myself because I’d been
able to think independently.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.240
When we take independent thinking
as our starting point

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.190
forceful combative solutions can give way
to nurturing solutions

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.080
centred around the idea of personal growth.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.690
For example, when we see children forced into
the religion of their parents

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.180
some of us might want to try
and outlaw child indoctrination.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:34.140
But another approach is to ensure young children
are educated about all religions

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.240
and about the option of ticking ‘none’.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.500
That way we help to empower them with information.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.760
There’ll always be abusers and dogmatists.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.620
Rather than focus on limiting their behaviour

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.670
we can limit their influence

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:54.540
by educating and empowering our children.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.220
When you lie down with dogs,
you get up with fleas.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.740
When you leave a poisonous environment

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.660
sometimes you take a little poison with you.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.400
But it doesn’t have to be a permanent feature.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.400
Every time we notice
some of that poison in ourselves

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.240
we get the chance to detox
by choosing to grow

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.520
and define ourselves on our own terms

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.180
instead of copying enemies.
