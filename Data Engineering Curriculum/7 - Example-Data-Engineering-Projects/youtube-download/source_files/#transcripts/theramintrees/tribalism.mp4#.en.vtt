00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.120
Tribalism is broadly defined in neutral terms,
as the state or fact of being organized in tribes:

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.400
social groups sharing common
interests or attributes.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.460
The word "tribe" is often used in a positive way
to describe supportive communities.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.040
Individuals from abusive environments are
encouraged to "find their tribe":

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.260
to find others who, like them,
reject abusive relationships.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.860
But tribalism's also taken on another meaning,
referring, typically in a negative way,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.220
to behaviour and attitudes that stem from
strong loyalty to one's own social group.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.760
Group biases have been studied by
social psychologists for decades.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.900
In the 1960s, researchers proposed two main
explanations for group discrimination.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.040
They suggested it arose from
pre-existing competition between groups,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.380
or as an irrational attempt to find emotional
release by scapegoating others.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.220
But in the 1970s, Henri Tajfel found that
neither of these causes were necessary.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.540
All it took to create discrimination was
the act of dividing people into groups.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.200
He took 64 teenagers from the same school,
divided them into two arbitrary groups,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.920
and asked them to assign
monetary reward points

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.220
to anonymous members of
their own group and the other group.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.260
Awarding others instead of themselves
took away direct self-interest.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.700
Not only did subjects assign more money
to their own group than to the other group,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.500
they often maximised
the difference in rewards,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.120
even if it meant their
own group received less.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.440
For example, rather than give 15 points to an ingroup
member and 10 points to an outgroup member,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.540
They might give 11 points to the ingroup member
and 1 to the outgroup member.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.420
So, there was no self-interest, no meaningful
group identity, and no pre-existing conflict.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.320
Being from the same school,
there was a fair chance

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.560
some anonymous out group members
might even be close friends.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.500
But the overriding instinct was
loyalty to a random group.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.780
In his book, Moral Tribes, Joshua Greene
explores this tribalistic response,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.280
in relation to the problem of cooperation.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.900
Greene cites ecologist Garrett Hardin's
‘tragedy of the commons’ problem,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.440
in which some self-interested herders
raise livestock on a common pasture.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.020
To maximise their own profits, they
continue to increase their livestock.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.680
Eventually, the pasture succumbs
to overgrazing.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.840
The grass goes, the animals die,
and the herders are left with nothing.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.620
Hardin's thought experiment
illustrates how

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.000
individuals who act only in their own best
interests can all end up worse off.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.300
Greene frames morality as a set of
psychological adaptations,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.400
that allow otherwise selfish individuals
to reap the benefits of cooperation,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.520
aligning individual interests
with group interests.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.920
He illustrates how a range of elements in
our common human emotional apparatus

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.900
encourages cooperative behavior.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.240
We feel empathy, gauging the experience
of fellow group members,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.020
not just in some abstract way,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.880
but actively simulating their feelings and sensations
in our own brains, from pain to pleasure.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.800
We feel loyalty towards fellow group members,
inspiring us to help and defend them,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.980
sometimes at significant cost to ourselves.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.820
We feel guilt when we assert our own self-interest
against the interests of fellow group members.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.640
On the flip side, we feel contempt for members
who behave selfishly at the expense of others,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.140
like freeloaders, who exploit the group's
generosity without contributing.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.760
These and other reflex emotional reactions reinforce
cooperative behaviours that lead to group benefits.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.300
Further reinforcement comes
from concepts like reputation.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.680
As social creatures, we're highly attuned to information about trustworthiness.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.200
A trustworthy reputation can carry great social value
in helping to forge cooperative relationships.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.280
And, a reputation for consistently punishing
transgressions against the group

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.700
can discourage uncooperative behaviour.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.640
When reputations are damaged, the concept of redemption allows people to repair them,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.660
opening a path back to the group, and restoring
the win-win of mutual cooperation.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.160
Tribalism arises from our attempts to distinguish
cooperative strangers from non-cooperative strangers.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.180
To help make that distinction, we develop social indicators of shared values:

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.340
indicators like social rituals, language, clothes.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.340
We hunt for those indicators in others, and
adjust our behaviour towards them accordingly.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.560
So, the same processes that facilitate
cooperation between group members

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.000
also create sharp divisions between
members and non-members.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.400
This leads Greene to an important qualification:

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.840
morality didn't evolve
to promote universal cooperation.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.160
Our moral brains developed to align
the individual with the group,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.540
but left us with the higher-order problem of
‘the group versus everyone else.’

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.220
We moved from ‘me versus us’
to ‘us versus them’.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.380
Expanding on Hardin's
‘tragedy of the commons’,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.940
Greene presents
‘the tragedy of common-sense morality’.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.840
Instead of individual herders, we have individual groups,
each with its own ideas about cooperation.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.220
Group 1 thinks land should be
divided up into plots.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.560
Members have total freedom
to use their plot how they want.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.580
Herders who prosper through hard work
can purchase neighboring land.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.840
Herders who are lazy or foolish, or who greedily graze,
suffer the consequences alone, including death.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.120
Group 1 forms a council with minimal powers,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.700
simply ensuring property is respected
and promises are honoured.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.620
Group 2 thinks the whole land
should belong to everyone.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.760
Here no individual prospers, but
no individual is left to die.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.000
Group 2 forms a council with extensive powers,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.880
assigning and supervising all work for
group members who have no autonomy.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.240
Hard workers are forced to share
all proceeds with lazy workers.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.280
Both groups believe their own system
represents common-sense morality,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.480
while the other group's system is
irrational and immoral.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.480
But their convictions about their moral values
might not be as solid as they think.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.080
In 2003, social psychologist Geoffrey Cohen
recruited liberal and conservative college students

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.740
with strong opinions on welfare
for a study in group influence.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.120
He presented them with one of
two versions of a welfare policy:

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.580
one provided generous benefits;
the other offered slender, stringent benefits.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.520
Pilot tests confirmed predictions that
liberals would prefer the generous version,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.140
and conservatives would
prefer the stringent one.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.020
In the actual experiment, when one of
the policies was presented to a participant,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.980
half the time it was claimed to be
supported by the Democrats;

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.240
half the time it was claimed to be
supported by the Republicans.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.400
So, half the time the policy and
party support were politically consistent;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.100
but half the time they were
politically conflicted.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.500
Cohen found that when they conflicted,
participants showed a strong tribal bias,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.360
focusing on the party support
rather than the content of the policy.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.000
Liberals strongly favoured conservative policies labelled
Democrat over liberal policies labelled Republican.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.880
And conservatives strongly favoured
liberal policies labelled Republican

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.840
over conservative policies labelled Democrat.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.180
Subjects later denied being
influenced by the party labels,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.080
although many of them believed
other people would be influenced,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.820
especially their ideological adversaries.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:54.900
To know that group identity can effectively nullify
group values in this way should give us serious pause.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.160
It means when we have reasonable,
useful, positive ideas from other groups —

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.460
or unreasonable, corrupt ideas from our own group —

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.900
we might be responding to them purely on the basis
of their group origin, instead of their content.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.480
This helps to explain how subjects
from evolution to climate change

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.220
are sometimes denounced or defended by individuals
with no knowledge or understanding of the evidence,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.780
instead of being assessed on the data
from the relevant scientific disciplines.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.860
Greene notes when false beliefs become
tribal badges of honour, they're difficult to change.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.900
It's no longer just about teaching the facts,
but about combating overbearing group influence.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.720
So, is there any way out of this
tribalistic ‘us versus them’ thinking?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.600
Finding common ground in the
short term is clearly possible.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.200
In the face of a common enemy, many groups
have managed to temporarily forget their differences.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.900
Alan Moore and David Gibbons's
brilliant graphic novel, Watchmen,

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.540
plays with the question of whether an ongoing
common enemy could be artificially manufactured

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.360
to bring about permanent peace
between hostile groups.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.580
The novel is set in an alternative timeline,

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.920
during a nuclear standoff between
the United States and the Soviet Union,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.160
this time populated with superheroes.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:22.840
Retired superhero Adrian Veidt stages a hoax alien
invasion on New York that devastates the city,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.440
creating a truce between the two earthly superpowers.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.480
The movie adaptation has a different twist.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.820
As the novel acknowledges,
solutions based on deception hold big risks.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.760
Discovery of the subterfuge
could destroy the truce.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.480
Uniting against a common enemy can
just create tribalism on a larger scale,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.100
perpetuating all the same distorted thinking.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.420
Sometimes the common enemy might be
a genuine malevolent threat,

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.040
but sometimes we might be demonising
a group that just has different preferences.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.060
The group might be falsely labelled
an enemy for political reasons.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.480
It's easy to become the monsters
we think we're attacking.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.480
When targeted groups lash back in self-defense,
we take it as proof of their aggressive nature.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.680
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy;

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.900
by looking for trouble we create it.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.320
Uniting against a common enemy
doesn't resolve our differences;

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.080
it just puts them on ice.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.420
When the enemy's defeated,
differences can resurface,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.880
and even turn a former ally
into a new common enemy.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.940
Appealing to our common
humanity feels more positive.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.200
But again, things can backfire
if we try to sweep away our differences.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.240
Any unresolved issues we have about our differences
can block our collective progress,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.320
and the most trivial-seeming differences
can arouse unexpected issues.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.020
When I studied psychological
therapies at university,

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.060
during a two-day retreat exploring
a range of personal differences,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.840
We were scored on our preference for
planning, structure, and resolution, versus

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.780
improvisation, spontaneity,
and open-endedness.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.060
The tutor arranged us in a
giant U-shape according to our scores,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.720
with the highest-scoring planner at one end
and the highest-scoring improviser at the other,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.980
then invited us to form small groups with our
nearest neighbors and discuss our preferences.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:18.180
It later emerged that in those private discussions,
improvisers were labelled unnatural by planners,

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.180
and planners were labelled unnatural by an improviser.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.980
These therapy students
were trained in empathy.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.640
But on finding out other folks
didn't share their preferences,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.640
they tried to pathologise
and stigmatise them.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.440
Some valuable lessons were learned
that day about appreciating differences.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.520
We're not all the same, and overcoming
tribalism doesn't entail being the same.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.600
It's about finding enough common
humanity to be able to hear each other

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.080
and discuss our differences rationally.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.480
And let's be real — some folks have a vested interest
in not finding common humanity:

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.220
leaders of high-control groups,
segregationist groups,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.280
doomsday groups who welcome Armageddon
as the fulfillment of their faith.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.160
But finding common humanity
doesn't require everyone's participation.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:11.180
It's a choice any individual can make at any time,
including disillusioned members of separatist groups.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.580
Each person who makes that choice
gets the chance to experience:

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.580
wider communication with people
who might otherwise have been dismissed,

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.460
deeper understanding from information that
might otherwise have been distorted or censored,

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.000
and greater personal autonomy from
an enhanced awareness of our options.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.760
Establishing a common humanity means
overcoming two distinct problems.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.960
One is the tribalistic wiring
of our moral brains,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.820
which naturally favours ingroup cooperation
at the expense of intergroup cooperation.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.880
Another is the clash between
the moral systems of different groups.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.220
Overcoming these problems involves effort,
and possibly some psychological discomfort.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.440
But every individual who overcomes them
makes a difference.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.180
Regarding our tribalistic wiring,

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:01.540
psychologists and neuroscientists have repeatedly
described two different human thinking styles.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.460
A. David Redish calls them
Pavlovian and deliberative.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.680
Daniel Kahneman calls them
system 1 and system 2, or fast and slow.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.040
Joshua Greene refers to them as
automatic and manual.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.120
They all capture the same idea.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.400
We have a reflexive style of thinking,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.880
that's instinctive, effortless, emotional,
and produces automatic responses.

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:26.380
And we have a reflective style of thinking,

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:32.220
that's conscious, effortful, logical,
and allows us to assess alternative responses.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.620
It's not that one thinking style's
better than the other;

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.800
they're just suited to different jobs.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.980
Greene uses the analogy of
automatic and manual camera settings.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.280
For everyday purposes, the camera's
automatic mode will give good results.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.280
It's designed to cater to a range of
common photographic conditions.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.080
But it has trouble outside those conditions.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.880
Photos come out under- or over-exposed,

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.160
colour balance suffers,
images get blurred.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.120
To correct these errors,
cameras have a manual mode,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.160
allowing us to adjust focus,
shutter speed, and white balance.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.860
Takes more time, but produces
much more accurate pictures.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:14.520
Likewise, in everyday conditions, our social brains
tend to do a decent job in automatic mode,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:20.460
using a range of fixed emotional reflexes that
encourage beneficial cooperation with fellow members.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.660
But outside those conditions,
the limitations of our fixed reflexes become clear.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.000
We might falsely denounce some groups as immoral
just because we find them strange,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.160
and our simplistic, automatic thinking
equates strange with wrong.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.820
Like a camera, we can move over to
manual mode to correct our mistakes.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.540
We can widen our lens, take in and
evaluate more complex information,

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.520
and produce a clearer moral picture.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.300
If we find someone strange, instead of responding
with reflex condemnation, we can ask ourselves:

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:55.280
Has this person done wrong?
Has anyone been harmed?

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.400
And we might reach
a different conclusion.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.020
Our capacity for manual thinking
gives us an extraordinary opportunity

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.420
to move beyond the confines
of our limited reflex instincts.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.160
Manual thinking is our ladder
out of tribalism.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:15.060
Unfortunately, that ladder can turn into a
hamster wheel, locking us into tribalism.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.100
This is the double-edged nature
of manual, deliberative thinking.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:25.080
We can use it in a critical, detached way to scrutinise
our moral instincts and correct our tribal prejudices.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.780
Or, we can use it to try and invent elaborate
justifications that confirm those prejudices.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.260
Unfortunately, a psychological phenomenon
called cognitive dissonance

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.820
often pushes us towards the
hamster wheel instead of the ladder.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.900
When we experience conflicting cognitions —
beliefs, emotions, thoughts —

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:48.020
we feel a discomfort that drives us to
reduce that conflict and seek consistency.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.320
In seeking consistency, it's easier
to invent fallacious reasons to confirm

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.940
what we already believe, feel, and think,

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.360
than to do the tough mental work
of questioning our assumptions.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.440
Take the earlier example of asking ourselves if
anyone's been harmed by a person we find strange.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.580
If we can't find any evidence
of injury or damage,

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.300
we might twist the meaning of the word
‘harm’ to prejudice the answer.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.980
We might say the person's
strangeness violates nature.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.280
Even if the person's strangeness is
observed throughout the natural world,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.900
we can still claim it wasn't intended for humans —
only other animals.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:27.820
We might claim the person's strangeness defies the
wishes of invisible supernatural entities, called gods.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.720
We might suggest the person's strangeness
offends the tribes sensibilities.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.820
If we take the easy hamster wheel
of self-justification,

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.620
using our manual thinking
to confirm our prejudices,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.840
we can fool ourselves that
these accusations are valid.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.720
If we take the ladder, using our manual
thinking to challenge our prejudices,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.260
we might notice none of these accusations
identify any injury or damage.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.180
They're all just ways of confirming
that strange means wrong,

00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:00.180
and they can all be arbitrarily applied to absolutely
any activity people want to stigmatise.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.720
Folks who use these
spurious tribal accusations

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.880
might not appreciate that it's in their
own best interest not to use them.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.920
In using them against other groups,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.060
they have no come back when other
groups accuse them of violating nature,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.820
defying other gods, or
offending other sensibilities.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.520
Live by the fallacy,
die by the fallacy.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.900
This is the second problem in
establishing common humanity:

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.600
the clash between the
moral systems of different groups.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.280
Philosopher John Rawls's thought experiment,
‘the veil of ignorance’,

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.020
invites us to construct a moral system, while
imagining we're just about to be born

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:42.620
with no knowledge of what our abilities, preferences,
physical traits, or position in society will be.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:48.220
It's in our interest not to disadvantage any group,
because we could be born into that group.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.500
The idea is that a fair system is
one we'd happily be born into at random.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.360
In discussing morality with other groups,
we could imagine a veil of membership.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.860
Here the task is to explain
our ideas on their own merits,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.300
without reference to the common-sense
notions of any specific group.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.100
Developing a common moral language means
acknowledging that it's pointless

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.040
constructing moral arguments in ways
we wouldn't accept from others.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.860
If we're not persuaded by the supernatural
threats and inducements of other groups,

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.360
why expect them to be persuaded by ours?

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.540
If we wouldn't accept authority-based moral declarations
from the authorities of other groups,

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:30.040
we can't expect others to accept authority-based
moral declarations from us.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.680
If we wouldn't accept bold assertions about rights
and responsibilities from other groups,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.700
we shouldn't make bold assertions about
rights or responsibilities to them.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.520
When we're used to assuming the
common-sense truth of our groups ideas,

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.820
it can be jarring and illuminating to try
to explain them from first principles,

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.140
to move from automatic to manual thinking.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.320
Joshua Greene cites the case of
18th-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.820
who tortured himself for years trying to find grounds
to justify harsh punishments for homosexuality,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.000
which he called an abomination.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.300
But, working through the arguments
against homosexuality in a detached way,

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.820
he finally concluded it represented
no harm or cause for public alarm,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:19.020
and argued for its decriminalisation, catapulting him
centuries ahead of the tribal common-sense of his era.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.360
Detached manual thinking
changes the freedoms we defend.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.300
Some people are surprised when
an atheist defends religious freedom,

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.060
when a Jew defends the freedom of
expression of Holocaust deniers,

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.760
when an ex-Muslim defends
the freedom to wear hijabs,

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.360
when a Muslim defends the freedom
to draw the author of Islam, Muhammad.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.180
Superficially, they might seem to be
working against their own interests.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.400
But they're just thinking on a
human level instead of a tribal one.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.540
Detached manual thinking
changes our loyalties.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.320
When we expand loyalty from tribal to human

00:19:53.320 --> 00:20:00.040
concern for truth and justice can be aligned on all levels:
individual, group, and human.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.480
When loyalty's tribal,
the group is misaligned.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.960
The region of non-overlap could be labeled hypocrisy,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.740
where the group reserves special treatment for itself
that it doesn't extend to other groups.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:17.560
We see tribal loyalty when groups who condemn
child abuse shield molesters in their own ranks,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.880
and when fraudulent politicians are protected
from the jail-time any other citizen would serve.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.940
It's one law for us and another for them.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.560
Detached manual thinking changes our empathy.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.320
It's easy to feel empathy
for members of our own groups.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.240
But to cross the ‘us versus them’ divide, we need to be
able to empathise with people outside our groups.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:44.200
Sometimes we hold back from that because we confuse
empathising with validating someone's viewpoint.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.820
Empathy is just about understanding
why someone feels a particular way.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.780
Without understanding someone's position,
communication is blocked.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.560
Some theists claim
atheists just want to sin.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.120
They fail to understand not only that atheists
can derive morality through secular principles,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.920
but that we have a very
obvious moral motivation:

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.560
to enjoy the benefits of
mutual support and cooperation.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.020
Some atheists claim
all theists are mentally ill.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.240
Rather than arguing that
theists hold flawed beliefs,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.500
they leap to a psychiatric explanation.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.220
We all hold flawed beliefs
and for various reasons.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.160
Sometimes we're mistaken.
Sometimes we're deliberately deceived.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.060
Sometimes we're indoctrinated,
which is how I became a theist.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.320
I required no psychiatric intervention;

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.620
my indoctrination was broken
by detached reflection.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:38.840
I started out on the hamster wheel of self-justification, 
trying to confirm my indoctrination,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.420
but I unwittingly ended up
on the ladder to atheism.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.860
When we expand empathy beyond
the tribal level to the human level,

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.220
false judgments start to fall away.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.595
We start seeing the individuals
behind the group label,

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.220
and communication opens up.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.300
When we form groups,

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:02.360
our social brains are wired to encourage cooperation
and social cohesion within those groups.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.700
An unfortunate downside to that
beneficial wiring is tribalism,

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.860
leading us to elevate
ourselves above other groups.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.320
But, tribalism isn't inevitable.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.980
Our capacity for detached reflection
offers a path out of it.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.140
It involves more effort than
our everyday reflex thinking,

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.080
and it can arouse discomfort when
long-held ideas are challenged.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.440
But the benefit to our collective
moral progress is clear.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.180
It's often said, ‘there's no 'i' in team’.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.920
But there is in ‘tribe’.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.460
And it's a great reminder not to be
swallowed up by our groups,

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:44.520
but to value and preserve individuality,
integrity, and independent thought;

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.700
to always feel able to question our
groups and resist the errors of tribalism.
