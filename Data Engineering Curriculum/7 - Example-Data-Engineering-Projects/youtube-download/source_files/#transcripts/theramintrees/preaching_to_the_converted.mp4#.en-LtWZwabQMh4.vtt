00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.400
‘Nice video. But ultimately pointless .... 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.200
You're just preaching to the converted .... 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.100
Those who disagree with you will never listen anyway.’

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.900
For me, this kind of comment o’erbrims with a world-weary cynicism. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.700
According to this comment people either already agree with you

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.500
in which case you’re wasting your breath .... 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.100
or they disagree with you, in which case they are fixed ....

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.400
and nothing you can say will change that. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200
So you’re still wasting your breath.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.100
But is any of that true?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.000
Where’s the middle ground here? 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.500
Where are the folks who’re undecided on the issue? 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.900
Could they perhaps be an important group, receptive to information? 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Characterise the issue as dichotomous and that’s the information you’ll get back. 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
But when we bother to look closer

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.000
even ostensibly dichotomous issues tend to elicit a spectrum of opinion

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.200
with very healthy, curvaceous distributions.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.000
What about people who’re unaware of the issues being talked about? 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.400
Is it not worthwhile putting the issues out there for those people? 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.400
So that they have the chance to become aware of the issues, and see what they think about them?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.400
If you believe it’s true that all those who disagree never listen

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.100
explain how folks go from being religious fundamentalists to atheists. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.900
How do you account for that transition? 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.900
The very word ‘converted’ implies the possibility of change from one state to another. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.900
Clearly, people who disagree often do listen.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.300
And even if someone doesn’t listen at the time

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.900
putting a video out there — or a book — 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.400
means that it will be available should their preparedness to listen change.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.900
People do change. Not only as individuals, but also on a generational level.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900
Otherwise we’d never have seen this.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
There’s a tacit assumption that discussion with folks who agree with us is worthless.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.900
Personally, I often find discussion with ‘the converted’ very engaging and creative. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.300
I think it can refine our thinking.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700
I think it can illuminate new perspectives. 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.900
It can offer resources. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.700
Some people have a hard time defending their position 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.400
because they haven’t yet thought through a lot of the classic arguments. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.700
If counters to those classic arguments are made available

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100
that can be a valuable resource to draw on.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.900
Purely on the grounds of support — 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.300
I get PMs from many people who feel extremely isolated in some very oppressive communities

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.900
who tell me that it’s good to see people talking about the same stuff.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.100
Videos they see on YouTube make them feel stronger —

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.300
give them more confidence in what they believe, and who they are. 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.000
Is that pointless?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.100
Discussion with people who agree with us can galvinise us from apathy. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.100
To be more vocal, more visible. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.900
And not to succumb to the futility of sentiments like this.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.300
I’m not just preaching to the converted. 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.900
But, like I’ve explained: 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.900
even if I was only talking to the converted, that would be no less worthwhile to me.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.100
Humanity isn’t divided into ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’ and never the twain shall meet. 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.100
Humanity is a spectrum

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.500
with many people undergoing huge, sometimes polar transformations of attitude, during their lifetime. 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.900
Addressing that vast amorphous crowd ....

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.800
being part of that relentless human conversation .... 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.000
seems far from pointless to me.
