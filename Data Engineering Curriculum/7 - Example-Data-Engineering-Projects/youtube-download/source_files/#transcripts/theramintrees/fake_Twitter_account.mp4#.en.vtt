Just a quick note to alert you that a fake twitter account was recently created by someone, using my channel name and channel icon

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.159
and responding to other users as me

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.679
Several friends have reported this violation to twitter

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.799
Obviously this kind of identity theft and online deception is nothing new

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.438
And it just serves as another reminder to be wary of who we're interacting with when we're not face to face

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920
It's not always who we think

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.939
For future reference; I'm not on twitter or facebook

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.599
So you can be sure any profiles claiming to be me, or to speak on my behalf, are fake

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.840
Any genuine links to other platforms will be authenticated by me through this youtube channel

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
Thanks for your vigilance

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.879
peace
