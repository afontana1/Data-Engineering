00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.700
It's a subject psychologists have been investigating
for the better part of a century.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.600
In this video, I wanted to share a couple of the old pioneering studies in this area,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.520
plus a recent neurological study that offers surprising ideas on just how deeply we're affected by group opinion.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.600
I'll end with some personal observations,
and an invitation.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.480
In 1935, in his study of social influences, Sherif made use of a phenomenon called the autokinetic effect.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.660
This is where a stationary point of light in a completely dark room will appear to move.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.920
This happens because the eye makes tiny, involuntary movements all the time.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.680
In a well-lit room with clear reference points, our brain compensates for these involuntary movements, so that the world appears stationary.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.440
But in a totally dark room, we've got no frame of reference to tell our brain whether it's our eye that moved, or the point of light.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.640
Sherif asked individual subjects to estimate how far the point of light moved.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.000
When asked individually, the range of answers given was pretty broad.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.080
Some consistently reported that the light moved about six inches; others consistently reported that it barely moved at all.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.040
But when asked as a group, subjects' answers converged toward an average distance.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.560
Subjects rejected the idea
that they'd been influenced by the group,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.980
but went on, in subsequent individual tests, to give answers consistently close to their group norm.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.620
Sherif's experiment was criticized for using an ambiguous task.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.780
Not knowing for sure how far the light moved, subjects were more prone to change their minds.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.640
But what would happen if the task wasn't ambiguous?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.680
In the 1950s, Asch addressed this question using very concrete stimuli.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.860
He assembled groups of seven to nine college students in a classroom, for an experiment ostensibly about visual judgment.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.600
He then presented a series of cards like this.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.560
Going around the group, participants then had to identify which of the lines on the right matched the line on the left.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.800
The twist was that, in reality, all the participants except one were confederates of Asch,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.240
who'd secretly been instructed to give the wrong answer on twelve out of eighteen sets of cards, starting with the third set.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.140
Asch tested one hundred and twenty-three subjects.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.260
In normal circumstances, subjects gave incorrect answers less than 1% of the time.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.520
With the social pressure of the confederates applied, that shot up to an incidence of around 37%,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.420
with 74% of subjects conforming to the majority on at least one critical trial.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.840
Subjects didn't necessary conform straight away—some started out defying the group for a couple of rounds,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.160
but became gradually more hesitant and quiet, before conformity eventually kicked in.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.160
Asch proposed that conformity could be explained by distortions occurring at any of three levels:

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.540
Perception, Judgment, and Action.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.160
At the action level, subjects believe the majority are wrong, but go along with them anyway.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.040
At the level of judgment, subjects perceive there is a conflict, but reject their own judgment, concluding the majority are right.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.720
At the level of perception, subjects' perceptions are genuinely distorted by the majority answers.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.100
A recent neurological study by Berns and colleagues investigated these three explanations,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.100
using magnetic resonance imaging to examine the brain activity involved in this social phenomenon.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.620
Thirty-two subjects were tested in all, and this time the task involved rotating two 3D objects to decide whether or not they matched.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.380
As with Asch's experiments, the rest of the group were confederates, instructed to give predetermined right or wrong answers.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.540
Consistent with Asch's findings, subjects on average conformed 41% of the time,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.900
but of course the main thrust of this experiment was to see what parts of the brain were associated with this conformity.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.700
If conformity occurred at the level of perception, areas like the occipital and parietal lobes, used in visuospatial awareness, would be expected to show activity.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:56.020
If it occurred at the level of judgment and action, other areas would be predicted, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, used in decision-making.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.880
The MRI scans showed activity in the occipital-parietal network, supporting the perception explanation.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.720
If it's true that subjects' perceptions are genuinely distorted, that means that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.060
group opinion has the potential to affect an individual's information processing on a very profound level.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.740
Now, I'd suggest that it's not possible to generalize these results back to Asch's subjects.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.760
I'd suggest there's a substantial difference in difficulty between the two tasks,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.440
so that with the rotation task, subjects might well be more prone to rely on other people's judgments.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.380
To be sure the same brain processes are at work in Asch's experiment,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.920
subjects would have to be tested doing his single line task.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.300
And even though the perception explanation was supported here,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.860
we know that the other two processes do exist.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.140
We can all think of instances in our lives when we've knowingly gone alone with the majority,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.280
despite private reservations, or preferences.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.240
There are loads of human mechanisms that can work for or against us.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.320
Our pattern-seeking behavior has led to all kinds of scientific breakthroughs, where we've correctly identified patterns in nature.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.440
It's also given rise to all kinds of irrational superstitions, where we've imagined patterns or relationships that have no basis in reality.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.040
Clearly, conformity can have its advantages: it can give social life a convenient structure, predictability.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.800
It allows us to maintain all sorts of helpful social conventions like queuing, without the hassle of constant challenge or renegotiation.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.320
But it begins to work against us when we allow ourselves to be tyrannized by group opinion, in areas where group opinion simply shouldn't figure.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.360
We can end up distorting huge chunks of our authentic selves for absolutely no good reason:

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:41.360
chunks of autonomy, personal desires and preferences that have no impact on others,  valid objections on important issues.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.600
It's my contention that we give up a lot more than we know.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.720
Pressure to conform is pervasive and insidious.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.320
We often feel liberated when we break away from a majority that we realize we've been subscribing to purely because of social pressures to conform.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.960
We form minority communities that seem to represent freedom from those pressures.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.920
We then find that these minority communities can become rife with exactly the same pressures to conform to them.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.320
In a 2007 study into how we assess group opinion, Weaver and colleagues found that

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.880
hearing an opinion repeated three times by the same person in a group had almost exactly the same impact

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.440
as hearing the opinion expressed by three different people in a group.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.240
Weaver argues that we assess an opinion's popularity by how familiar it is to us—how many times we've heard it.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:36.680
And unfortunately, our brains don't always distinguish between an opinion expressed by many individuals and an opinion merely repeated by the same few.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.880
We can be self-defeating in our conformity. Say we have a group of people holding opinion X.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.440
Unbeknownst to the group, half of them secretly disagree,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.480
but due to the social penalties they've seen dished out to a few individuals who have disagreed, they keep quiet.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:01.440
By conforming, we add to the statistics of groups we don't actually belong to, and perpetuate the idea of majorities who may not actually exist.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.560
Imagine if none of us conformed in that way, how that would change the social landscape.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.960
Just knowing about Asch's experiment makes us less susceptible as potential subjects in similar experiments.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.960
The more aware we are of our vulnerabilities to conform on any level, the better we're able to defend against it.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.960
It's easier to be skeptical about groups we don't belong to, or that we've broken away from.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.600
But conformity really kicks in with the groups we identify with.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.760
To get the support and acceptance we might seek from those groups,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.920
we can find ourselves giving up more than we bargained for in return.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.480
Being part of a group doesn't mean agreeing with every part of that group.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.840
We should always feel able to voice legitimate criticisms with any group,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.520
whether that's family, friends, social interest groups, whoever.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:53.320
When we stop feeling able to do that, we give those groups status and authority that they don't deserve,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.600
and that they actually don't possess.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.120
If a group can't handle legitimate dissent,
it's not a group I want to be a part of.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.560
Thinking is the first step. Doing is the next.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.840
Some people spend years reading self-help books, having profound realizations, epiphanies, breakthroughs—in their head,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.240
then they're sometimes deflated to find that, with all that amazing awareness, their life doesn't seem to change.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.440
It doesn't change because, despite their insights, they don't change their behavior.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.200
Awareness is important, but behavior is just as crucial.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.640
Berns' study showed that individuals who went against the group exhibited brain activity associated with emotional arousal.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.680
It feels risky to stand out, but, as with most things, the more you do it, the easier it feels.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.400
I think it's important to push ourselves in life,
to stretch ourselves.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.960
If we don't expect much from ourselves, we can stagnate, but expectations need to be realistic—

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.720
our own expectations,
and other people's expectations of us.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.480
Disappointing people can actually be very humanizing.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.800
It can give those we disappoint the opportunity to realize that their demands might not be reasonable.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.000
So I'm throwing open an invitation to consider some of the things we conceal about ourselves in order to conform:

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.960
Preferences, activities, beliefs, physical characteristics, that violate no one,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.720
but for some reason we submit to a perceived consensus that they're unacceptable.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.000
What kinds of fears lie behind our conformity
on these things?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.600
Are these judgments rational?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.440
You don't like to dance? Don't dance.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:32.200
The ideas, the books, the films, the people that inspire me are the ones that celebrate diversity, individuality, authenticity.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.320
I've certainly never been inspired by anyone who's encouraged conformity to the group,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.520
anyone who's tried to encourage fear, or tried to shrink my comfort zone.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.520
People who come out with this kind of fallacious bullshit. Have you?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:53.920
I say, question this stuff. Question the group.
And let's risk being more fully ourselves.
