00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.430
In November 2012 Australian ex-Prime Minister
Julia Gillard proposed a Royal Commission

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.540
to investigate institutional responses to
child sexual abuse.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.030
It covered a range of institutions including
schools, churches and sports clubs

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.460
in a total of 57 public hearings

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.019
recording the testimonies of nearly 7,000
abused individuals

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.150
around 64% of whom were male

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.940
and 10% of whom said it was the first time
they’d told anyone about their abuse.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.960
There would be testimonies
from people like Hugh

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.100
who was abused around age 10 by a scout leader

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.780
who, after gaining his parents’ trust, had
him over for parties

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.320
where boys were plied with marijuana and alcohol
and molested.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.700
And like Margaret, who was 11 when she was
abused at a Salvation Army children’s home

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.600
by a church captain who not only molested
children

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.990
but orchestrated their abuse of each other.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.060
To conduct the Commission’s investigation,
a panel of six commissioners was appointed

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.160
headed by Justice Peter McClellan

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.160
a former Chief Judge for the Supreme Court
of New South Wales

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.780
and Assistant Commissioner for the Independent
Commission Against Corruption.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.040
In May 2015, the Commission began to investigate
‘case 29’ of their public hearings

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.160
which concerned responses to child sexual
abuse within the Jehovah’s Witness organisation.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.539
Assisting counsel for the Commission was the
formidable Angus Stewart QC.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.290
In a video called ‘concealing abuse’

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.380
I looked at how the Jehovah’s Witness organisation
responded

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.860
to real-life allegations of child sexual abuse
against its members

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.880
and how its policies tend to protect the abuser.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.640
For instance, even if they fully believe the
allegations made against a member

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.140
the congregation’s judicial and spiritual
leaders —&nbsp;known as ‘elders’ —

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.810
won’t take any action unless either there
are at least two witnesses to the abuse

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.900
which is unlikely in view of the private nature
of sexual abuse

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.120
or the abuser confesses voluntarily — which
is again, unlikely.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.000
Even when these exacting demands are met,
justice is far from guaranteed.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.760
While the organisation possesses
the judicial apparatus

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.510
to eject molesters from congregations

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.790
it repeatedly fails to use it.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.140
In a form of excommunication known as disfellowshipping

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.700
individuals judged to be unrepentant sinners
are completely shunned by all members

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.956
including family. But individuals found guilty
of molestation

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.420
can avoid this fate just by apologising.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.020
If they express repentance to their congregation’s
elders, they can simply be ‘reproved’.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.780
All this entails is an announcement being
made to their congregation

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.940
that they’ve been reprimanded for an unspecified
transgression.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.620
And that’s it.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.760
They’ll be left in the congregation, risking
further molestation

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.020
and the constant retraumatisation of the individuals
they’ve abused

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.850
who often feel forced out of their own congregation.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.170
These kinds of misguided policies serve to
protect abusers and punish the abused.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.290
Through its in-depth investigation of individual
cases

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.100
the Australian Royal Commission would expose
a daunting maze of unthinkable additional hurdles

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.700
faced by sexually abused children raised in
the Jehovah’s Witness organisation.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.410
The Commission focused on the experiences

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.540
of two individuals abused by members of the
organisation.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.540
For anonymity, the individuals were codenamed
BCB and BCG.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.400
BCB was the first to take the witness stand.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.430
She testified to the following account:

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.880
She was born in 1967.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.520
When she was 10, her mother
became a Jehovah’s Witness

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.060
and started taking her and her brother to
meetings.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.440
BCB drifted apart from her father who didn’t
attend.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.130
At age 12, she met Bronwyn and Bill Neill

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.170
and became friends with a daughter of theirs.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.530
She would attend meetings at their house and
sleep over.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.509
Mr. Neill discouraged both girls from making
non-Witness friends at school

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.539
based on the idea that ‘bad association
spoils useful habits’

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.760
a sentiment derived from the Biblical passage
1 Corinthians 15:33.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.319
The sexual jokes Mr. Neill started making
in front of her

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.810
would signal the onset of an escalating pattern
of abuse.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.050
At age 14, when she stayed over with the Neill
family

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.059
he started inserting his tongue in her mouth
when he kissed her goodnight.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.140
She would endure these inappropriate kisses
for the next four years.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.120
She felt ashamed and scared, and worried about
upsetting Mrs. Neill.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.460
But Mr. Neill was an elder, and she submitted
to his authority.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.260
When she was 17, he intruded on her while
she was showering

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.800
somehow managing to unlock a locked door.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.360
He left when she screamed ‘Get out’

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.160
but later gave her a vicious belting for making
too much noise in her bedroom.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.020
At age 18, she was subjected to more overtly
sexual behaviour.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.509
He called her a nymphomaniac and a prostitute.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.789
One time, Mrs. Neill caught him tongue-kissing
BCB and stopped him.

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.240
But nothing further was said or done — and
his forcefulness escalated

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.259
culminating in an incident in which he trapped
BCB in the bathroom

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.880
and violated her manually and orally.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.379
The next day, he entered her room and suggested
she’d enjoy full intercourse.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:22.069
She asked him to leave, then packed and returned
to her parents’ farm.

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.250
The next year, when he heard through his daughter

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.110
that BCB had been seeing a couple of boys

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.120
Neill invoked his role as an elder to summon
her to talk about boys.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.360
She felt she had no choice.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.180
He took the opportunity to inspect her physically
and abuse her verbally.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.880
Two years later in 1989, having married

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.979
she confided in her husband and also a friend
about Neill’s abuse.

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.089
The friend then disclosed this information
to someone else.

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:58.060
A week or so later, a young elder called Max
Horley approached her to arrange a visit.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.720
During the visit, he revealed he’d come
to talk about Neill.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.640
BCB gave some details but was too ashamed
to recount the bathroom incident.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.760
Horley invited Neill to BCB’s house, to
speak with her and her husband.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.719
Despite her discomfort at opening up her own
home to her abuser

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.520
she did as she was told on the assumption
that Horley knew the correct procedure.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.420
She didn’t recall having the purpose of
the meeting explained to her.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:27.749
And she felt too inhibited to recount the
full details in front of Neill

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:32.319
or challenge him when he suggested his behaviour
was meant as a joke.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.680
Afterwards, BCB approached Horley and gave
more details.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.849
This led to a second meeting, with the addition
attendance of one Doug Jackson

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:45.939
a circuit overseer — someone who supervises
multiple congregations.

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:49.559
His presence and the purpose of the meeting
weren’t explained

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.580
it was just presented as a ‘committee meeting’.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.399
Neill attempted to blame BCB for wearing revealing
clothes

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.060
but Jackson said the church didn’t accept
that excuse.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.120
Again Neill’s presence inhibited her, as
did being in a room full of men.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.840
She said if a female she trusted from the
congregation had been there too

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.760
it might’ve been easier.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.960
At the end of the meeting, Neill was told
to apologise, which he did.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:23.159
BCB was given no explanation of the meeting’s
outcome or of what would happen.

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:26.529
Jackson gave her an article about child sexual
abuse

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:30.780
published in one of the organisation’s magazines,
called the Watchtower.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:36.640
Not long after this, Mrs. Neill phoned BCB
and told her ‘Bill didn’t abuse you.’

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.680
BCB reported this to Horley, who said he’d
sort it out.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.100
Later that day, he phoned and said:

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.540
‘The Neills have asked that you not tell
any more people about Bill

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.170
out of respect for the family.’

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:54.600
Scared, disorientated and unsupported, she
did as she was told.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.940
It was only years later that she saw the perversity

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.880
of being asked to respect the man who abused
her

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.500
when nobody had offered her the respect or
support she deserved.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:11.120
Weeks later, it was announced that Neill had
stepped down as an elder, with no reason given.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.000
Nobody talked to BCB about her abuse

00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:18.339
and she was still expected to attend study
meetings at the Neills’ house.

00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:23.090
She asked not to go there — but was told
she had to.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.710
Mrs. Neill ignored her.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:31.500
Finally in 1994 she moved from the area to
another congregation.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.760
In 2012, she gave a written statement to two
elders

00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:39.519
including one Joe Bello, summarising her experience

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.660
in an effort to support the case of anyone
else Neill might’ve abused.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.670
Eighteen months later, Bello visited on an
unrelated matter

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.770
and BCB told him she was considering reporting
her abuse to the Royal Commission.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.400
She said Bello later spoke to her husband
and said:

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.360
‘You should ask [BCB] if she really wants
to drag Jehovah’s name through the mud.’

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.520
BCB was dismayed to find that the burden of
Neill’s shameful actions

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.500
had been put on her shoulders.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.060
Although she eventually reported her experiences
to the Royal Commission

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.949
she suffered extreme misplaced guilt about
betraying the organisation

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.819
guilt that manifested in physical symptoms

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:23.750
such as chest tightness, heart palpitations
and difficulty breathing.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.160
She reported that her abuse destroyed her
confidence and self-esteem

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.810
and instilled in her a sense of victimhood and a constant paranoia that people were judging her.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:39.750
She went on to experience suicidal thoughts
and a nervous breakdown.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.339
She said Neill’s position as an elder gave
him power over her

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:47.769
and suggested that if she’d been allowed
to speak to other children outside the congregation

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:51.880
they might’ve reported her abuse to the
appropriate authorities.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.870
She suggested a number of changes

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.540
in the way the organisation dealt with child
sexual abuse.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.079
She said it should take allegations more seriously
and report them to the police

00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:05.250
give proper support and protection for children

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.790
and not require female targets of male abuse

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:13.319
to speak in front of a room full of men, including
their alleged abuser.

00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:17.110
She also noted that no compensation was offered.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.220
The Commission sought to address all of these
issues.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.700
Max Horley was the next to testify, and sworn
in on a Biblical oath.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.680
Not long into Horley’s testimony

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.769
assisting counsel Stewart noted that he seemed
hesitant in his recollections

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:40.100
and asked if this was because of the passage
of time — which Horley affirmed.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.360
Judge McClellan asked Horley if he’d taken
notes.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.610
He said he might’ve at the time — but
they would’ve been destroyed.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.920
When asked why, he said the elders didn’t
want their wives

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.380
knowing what sort of things
they were dealing with

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:58.040
and that it was also to protect the person
involved and the rest of the congregation

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.780
so they didn’t have to know
about these things.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.240
It was not only a deeply patronising rationale
but a dangerous one

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.180
leaving congregations unsuspecting about the
molesters in their midst

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.240
which is exactly what molesters want.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.240
Horley confirmed that destroying notes remained
the current practice.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.560
When asked if he was aware of his obligations

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:23.319
to tell authorities about serious allegations
of sexual assault

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:25.170
Horley showed no awareness

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.400
and said he’d contact his branch for advice
on how to proceed.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.720
Unthinking deference to the branch would become
a familiar stock response

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.480
from the elders called to testify to the Commission.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.639
Horley expressed confusion about what constituted
criminal assault

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.500
and later admitted giving no consideration
to reporting it to the police.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.079
This was an individual invested with the safety
and protection

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:53.170
of an unquestioningly trusting congregation.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.420
A shepherd charged with guarding the flock.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.250
But in the shepherd metaphor, Horley was more
like the sheepdog

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.560
cluelessly obeying the whistles of an unseen
shepherd

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.220
who could just as easily direct him to harm
the sheep as to protect them.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:14.220
The Biblical passage Matthew 18:15 has been
cited by the organisation as a basis

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.310
for requiring abused individuals to confront
their abusers with their allegations.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:25.020
McClellan asked Horley if he realised how
inappropriate this process of confrontation was.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.240
Horley said he could understand it now, but
hadn’t reflected on it at the time

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.040
because he was just following procedure.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.839
He agreed it could be very difficult for people
who’d suffered abuse

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.380
to share everything done to them in front
of their abuser.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.840
He said the organisation wanted to keep Neill’s
abuse as quiet as possible

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.260
not to try to cover it up, but just to stop
the conversation.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.360
But almost immediately, he contradicted himself

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.069
saying they would’ve tried to keep the matter
under wraps

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:57.700
in another words cover it up.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.000
Stewart made the case to Horley
that by directing BCB

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.839
not to speak to anyone in the congregation

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:06.660
he left her with no one to talk to.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.500
Horley suggested that because BCB was still
working in the community

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.889
she could’ve spoken to people outside the
organisation.

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:16.740
But Stewart pointed out that members are advised
not to have

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.629
close friendships or associations with non-members.

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:22.819
Horley affirmed that was true

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.640
but said that whether members took that advice
or not was entirely up to them.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.420
Many of us who’ve experienced abusive environments

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.939
with be familiar with this responsibility-dodging
manoeuvre

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:39.230
in which individuals are given clear instructions
on what to do or what not to do

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.620
then when they suffer as a direct consequence
of following those instructions

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.560
they’re told they didn’t have to follow
them after all.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.420
And they’re blamed for their own suffering.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:53.529
The fact is Jehovah’s Witnesses are warned
in the strongest terms

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:57.209
against what are called ‘bad associations’
with non-members

00:14:57.209 --> 00:15:00.840
which they’re told will result in disaster.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.460
For Horley to suggest that BCB was somehow
supposed to view this

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.800
merely as a piece of advice she was free to
take or leave

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.800
was disingenuous in the extreme.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.240
Stewart put it to Horley that he was saying
two different things.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.120
On one hand, saying BCB couldn’t
speak to people

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.490
then on the other, that she could.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.290
Horley claimed he didn’t mean to cut BCB
off from any support

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.920
but admitted he couldn’t recall arranging
anyone to assist her through the period.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.680
Stewart produced a letter from Horley

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.040
and the circuit overseer Doug Jackson
to their branch office.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.899
The letter said: It appears that a number
of brothers know about the matter

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:42.310
and unfortunately there may be worldly people
who also know.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:47.450
‘Worldly’ is the derogatory term Jehovah’s
Witnesses use for non-members.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.889
Stewart asked why it mattered
if worldly people knew?

00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:56.320
Horley said the organisation didn’t want
anything to detract from their ‘clean’ reputation.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.940
In fact the organisation is heavily invested
in its reputation among outsiders.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.160
It seems perverse that it should be so concerned
about what worldly people think

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.760
considering it despises us as debauched and
degenerate

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.900
characterises us as the instigators of broken homes

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.580
illegitimate births and sexually transmitted diseases

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.460
and countless other emotional and physical woes

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.680
and compares us to what it calls ‘death-dealing’
polluted air.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.319
But of course projecting a ‘clean’ image

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.699
is what the organisation relies on to attract
new members.

00:16:29.699 --> 00:16:33.769
And it has no moral qualms whatsoever about
using deception

00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:36.820
to try and maintain that patently false image.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.460
It even has a formal policy
called ‘theocratic warfare’

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.220
that gives members explicit permission to
deceive worldly people

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.240
on the grounds that they’re not entitled
to the truth.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.220
I explored the perversity of this policy in
my ‘concealing abuse’ video.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.780
What that video doesn’t mention is a particular
exception to the policy

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.220
one of special relevance to the Royal Commission.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.620
Witnesses are told that when they take any
oath to tell the truth

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.250
or are placed on a witness stand, they’re
obligated to speak the truth

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.270
if they speak at all.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.280
In these circumstances,
the only option they have

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.140
other than to speak the truth,
is to remain silent.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.050
It’ll become clear that even this rule was
flouted

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.180
by Jehovah’s Witnesses during the Commission
hearing.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.040
It’ll also become increasingly clear just
how far down in their list of priorities

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.320
came the welfare of the children they were
supposed to protect.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.230
Horley and Jackson’s letter about Bill Neill
to the branch office stated:

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:40.500
‘We recommended to him that he step down
as an elder’ and that ‘He agreed to this.’

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.250
Stewart put it to Horley that it seemed they
had offered Neill

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:48.150
a chance to step down voluntarily, rather
than be forcibly removed.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:52.900
Horley denied this, claiming it was just an
unfortunate choice of words.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.880
But those unfortunate words were consistent
with BCB’s previous testimony

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.630
that Neill had merely stepped down.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.070
In the same letter, Horley and Jackson added

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.210
that they felt no further action or restrictions
need apply.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.950
This meant Neill was free to participate

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.620
in all the same church and Bible study meetings
as before

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:18.080
including meetings at his home which BCB was
expected to attend.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.280
The letter went on to make the bizarrely premature
recommendation

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.270
that once the matter had died down, Neill
should be recommended

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:30.140
as an elder again so he could help the congregation
as he’d done in the past.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.300
Stewart asked Horley if
by the phrase ‘dying down’

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.620
he meant once the controversy has abated.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.840
Horley claimed that the term ‘dying down’
was another case of unfortunate wording.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.560
When Stewart then suggested that Horley’s
prime concern

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.060
was about Neill’s reputation, he initially
rejected the idea.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.490
But Stewart continued along this line

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.410
suggesting that Horley’s concern was about
the functioning of his organisation

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.040
and not about the protection of children in
his congregation.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.780
Horley agreed.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.660
When Stewart put it to him his concern wasn’t
about what support he could offer BCB.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.260
Horley admitted that while that had ‘some
bearing’ for him

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.020
it was more about Neill’s qualifications
to teach.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.420
It was a stunning confession.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.800
Towards the end of his period in the witness stand

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.530
Horley was given a detailed account of BCB’s abuse.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.160
He hadn’t known about any of it and said
it came as a shock to him.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.570
He was asked if he thought the fact it was
only coming to light now

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.760
had something to do with the process he engaged
in when BCB made the initial complaint

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.120
a process in which she had to make her allegations
to her abuser

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.970
and an elder who she knew was friends with
her abuser.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.570
He said he could see the point being made.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.560
When it was suggested BCB needed a more nurturing
supportive environment

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.060
to make a full disclosure, he agreed.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.390
But when asked if he had any thoughts on what
the organisation should do about it

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.400
he reverted to compliant form, saying he had
no comments

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.440
he just followed the procedures.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.760
What came across from the many elders called
to testify at the Commission

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.330
was that they were so immersed in procedure

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.500
they failed to consider the accuser’s experience.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.900
Doug Jackson’s responses clearly illustrated
this lack of empathy.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.260
When it was put to Jackson that BCB was unaware

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.540
of the purpose of the meetings she was attending

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.760
initially he flat-out rejected the idea.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.460
But Stewart took some time to remind him

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.540
that as an elder he had knowledge not given
to the congregation

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.860
knowledge of judicial procedures, standards
of evidence and punitive measures.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.580
Stewart then asked Jackson if he’d accept
BCB wouldn’t know about these things.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.620
Jackson changed his ‘no’ to a ‘maybe’.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.300
Stewart asked if Jackson could see how this
lack of transparency

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.650
would’ve left BCB in a position of vulnerability
and confusion.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.220
Jackson said he did now.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.750
Stewart repeated to Jackson the portion of
BCB’s statement

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.520
in which she was asked in one of the judicial meetings

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.500
whether she had anything more to tell

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.540
and she falsely responded ‘No’ because
of various inhibiting factors.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.520
These included talking in front of a room
full of men

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:18.240
talking in front of her abuser and being afraid
of the consequences of telling the truth.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.770
Jackson accepted that talking about her abuse
to a room full of men

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.760
would’ve been very hard for BCB

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.340
as would talking in front of her abuser.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.160
But when it was put to him that BCB didn’t
feel it was a safe environment

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.720
he said he didn’t know why she would’ve
felt that

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.010
because they tried to comfort her.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.690
He seemed unable to comprehend that his supposed
efforts to comfort BCB

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.560
weren’t enough to magically overcome all
the intimidating factors she identified.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.760
Instead of admitting that he had failed to
comfort her

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.960
his instinct was instead to insinuate that
the failure was hers

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.160
she had failed to receive the comfort he offered.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:00.980
This kind of mindset is common in high-control
groups that deny individuality.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:06.740
Members are slotted into fixed procedures
and expected to give fixed reactions.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.780
When they don’t, the fault is with them
— not the procedure.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.000
McClellan put it to Jackson that the organisation’s
investigative process

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.420
inflicted further trauma on BCB.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.870
Jackson said he understood that now — but
hadn’t appreciated it at the time.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.060
It’s instructive to reflect on the reflex
dismissiveness of the elders

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.030
who testified at the Commission whenever it
was suggested

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:35.300
that the abused individuals in their care
felt unsafe or unsupported.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:41.140
Judge McClellan and assisting counsel Stewart
were two highly skilled communicators.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.030
They also wielded the power of the legal system.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:49.040
But even they had to repeatedly spend exhausting
swathes of time

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.690
walking the elders through their own procedures

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:56.320
trying to get them to empathise with the experiences
of those abused individuals.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.090
If, with their considerable skill and power

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.940
they had to work this hard to break through
the elders’ dismissiveness

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.650
what chance did an unskilled powerless member

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.460
of a Jehovah’s Witness congregation have
of making themselves heard?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.840
Another elder concerned with reputation was
Joe Bello

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.980
one of the elders BCB wrote to years after
the abuse

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.180
in an effort to protect other children from
Bill Neill.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.380
Asked about whether he would ever report a
matter to the police

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.650
Bello fell back on the mantra-like evasion
given by the other elders:

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.800
he’d contact the branch.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.340
Bello confirmed BCB’s account that when
her husband had mentioned

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.570
they were thinking of talking to the Royal
Commission

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.660
Bello had asked what that could accomplish

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.840
other than dragging Jehovah’s name through
the mud.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.900
It was put to him that this would be understood

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.900
as a discouragement against going to the Commission.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.200
He said that wasn’t how it was meant — he
was just thinking aloud.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.180
Although Bello initially seemed to regret
his words

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.250
and reflected that he shouldn’t have said them

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.760
he then revealed that he stood by the underlying
sentiment.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:07.200
Stewart asked him if, within his faith, Jehovah
was considered a loving god.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.980
When Bello confirmed this, Stewart asked if
Jehovah would not also then

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:15.180
be more concerned about the victim than his
own name.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:20.360
Defiantly, Bello replied: ‘Jehovah would
be concerned about the victim

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.900
but Jehovah is concerned about his own name too.’

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.120
Judge McClellan asked Bello if he’d been
following the work of the Royal Commission.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.190
Bello hadn’t — despite knowing a couple
of months previously

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.410
that he would have to give evidence.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.470
He said he might’ve scanned the headlines
of the Saturday paper

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.710
but he didn’t watch the news or listen to
the radio.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.140
His complete lack of interest in the Commission’s
work was abundantly clear

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.050
and consistent with the apathy exhibited

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.360
by most of the witnesses testifying for the
organisation.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.700
Doctor Monica Applewhite was paid by the organisation

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.000
to be an expert witness in its defence.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.660
Applewhite presented herself as an independent
consultant in child sexual abuse

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.370
visiting institutes to make risk assessments

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.760
and develop educational programs and policies.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.800
This included assessing how they prevented abuse;

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.940
how they responded to warning signs;

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.650
how they responded to disclosures of abuse;

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.040
and how they remedied the situation.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.020
Applewhite was an unexpected choice of champion
for the Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.620
because she was an active member
of the Catholic church

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.560
which the organisation has repeatedly dismissed
as a false religion

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.400
characterised as an enemy of true worship

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.380
criticised for its political meddling and
slated for its handling of child sexual abuse.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.200
Leaving aside the strangeness of this alliance

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.920
Applewhite’s testimony was a mess.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.460
Stewart and McClellan noted that many opinions

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.400
offered in her report had no source references.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.780
Applewhite said she was already fully scheduled

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.640
when she started working on the report

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.900
so she hadn’t been conscientious about her
citations.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.700
In fact what emerged from Applewhite’s report
and testimony

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.070
was that her so-called expert evidence

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.360
consisted of browsing online material from
the organisation’s own website

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.680
and speaking to staff from its legal branch.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.160
She said she hadn’t reviewed any specific cases

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.980
and couldn’t offer any opinion

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.240
on whether the implementation
of the organisation’s policies

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.740
had resulted in law-abiding responses

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.980
good practice of child protection
or compassionate care.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.900
As Stewart noted, all she’d basically done
was a documentary review.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.200
Applewhite showed a distinct lack of awareness

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.420
of the power relationship between elders and
congregation members

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.230
erroneously stating that elders were merely viewed

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.400
as ‘fellow workers’ by the congregation.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.440
As Stewart pointed out, elders were very clearly
characterised

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.480
by the organisation as shepherds over the flock.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.560
Their privilege and authority was reinforced
by the belief

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.840
that elders were directly appointed by the
Holy Spirit

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.500
another fact of which she was unaware.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.580
Applewhite stated there was no requirement

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.500
for elders or ministerial servants to be alone
with children.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.560
But Stewart produced a branch document directed
to all elders

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.000
stating that elders and ministerial servants
are put in a position of trust

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.340
that explicitly included being more liberal
about leaving children in their care.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.360
Applewhite was also unaware of the fact that
abused individuals

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.680
were cautioned not to reveal facts about the
congregation in group therapy.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.780
The only stipulation she’d heard in regards
to therapy

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.440
was that the organisation recommended choosing
someone

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.980
who respected their religious beliefs.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.980
As the facts about the actual experience of
abused individuals emerged

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.360
Applewhite began to withdraw

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.100
some of her poorly considered support for
the organisation.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.280
She announced that if it turned out that people

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.810
had to confront their abusers and had to sit
in the room with no support

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.780
that would not meet the standards of care.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.540
She conceded she hadn’t understood that
that was the process.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.260
Applewhite stated that when somebody abuses

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.880
and their internal mechanisms of control had
allowed them to cross that line once

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.720
she didn’t have confidence in those internal
mechanisms of control for the future.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.820
As such, she suggested that the risk
of re-offence was great

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.920
and agreed that positive steps needed to be taken

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.640
to ensure that such a person didn’t have access

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.350
or the opportunity to abuse again.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.350
She said there should be strong and cooperative
relationships

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.390
with child protection authorities

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.880
but had no awareness of the difficult relationship

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.040
the Jehovah’s Witness organisation had with
secular authorities.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.620
The Commission didn’t consider that Applewhite’s
report had assisted their enquiry

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.340
and rejected her opinions on numerous grounds

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.410
including lack of evidence or citations

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.660
but most damningly, because she’d failed
to investigate

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.660
the experiences of a single survivor of child
sexual abuse

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.940
whose complaint was dealt with by the Jehovah’s
Witness organisation.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.950
By the end of this first case

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:02.290
the Royal Commission had already gathered
confirmation of unthinkable negligence

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.350
deeply inappropriate and traumatising procedures

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:10.750
and a cover-up mentality that elevated reputation
far above the protection of children

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:16.500
and led to the use of shaming tactics on abused
individuals to try and silence them.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.460
From this atrocious start, things would only
get worse.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.180
As I’ll be showing in part two

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:27.320
shocking new levels of deception and corruption
within the organisation would be laid bare

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.620
including evidence that some elders had stooped
to breaking their own rules

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.920
in order to avoid exposing abuse.
