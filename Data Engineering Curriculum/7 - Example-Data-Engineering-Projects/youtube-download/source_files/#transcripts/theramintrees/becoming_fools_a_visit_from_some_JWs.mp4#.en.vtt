00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.800
They sat across the table from us
in a palpably heavy silence.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.580
For a while the pair of them looked intensely each other

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.840
as if willing the answer to spring magically
from the other one's mouth.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.660
Then they appeared to catch themselves.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.240
Their expressions softened and they turned to
us with an apologetic simper.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.650
It was a familiar pattern.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.330
After more silence they would assure us that
it was good that we were challenging them to think.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.590
Then more silence.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.520
More potent stares.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.520
Eventually, they'd tell us they'd
have to get back to us on that one

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.040
after consulting their spiritual elders.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.220
And we'd start a new subject.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.600
It was a handful of years after my
brother and I came as atheists

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.640
that, one summer, we invited
the Jehovah's Witnesses in

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.680
for what turned out to be several weeks of discussions.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.000
Pairs of JWs had often rang our doorbell

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.120
proferring issues of their organization's
publication: Watchtower.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.580
Selling strategies varied.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.160
Some came straight out with it

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.460
asking if we were interested in a magazine.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.640
Others acted like insurance sales folks

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.400
cryptically enquiring if we were interested
in making an important investment in our future.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.440
One pair opened with a baffling rant about
not conforming to what they called 'the system'.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.720
It was unclear what this system was.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.200
No mention of politics.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.780
No mention of religion.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.900
No mention of anything much.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.700
It was only the glimpse of a Watchtower in a handbag

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.940
that eventually contextualised this mystifying spectacle.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.840
At which point the door was closed
with a polite 'Not interested thanks'.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.900
But one year, as the frequency of
JW visitations appears to be escalating,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.300
my brother and I began to think, Well, if they
want a discussion why not have one?

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.720
These were the first civil approaches
we’d had to talk about religion

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.380
ever since we left the church.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.880
The christians in our personal lives had
been so snotty and belligerent in their approaches

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.100
that we'd become accustomed to shutting
religious discussions down.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.860
We decided to engage the very next pair
who turned up on the doorstep.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.220
And when Penny and Marcia rang a bell

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.440
we invited them in for what turned out
to be several weeks of discourse

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.440
spanning a range of subjects,
including hours of biblical assessment.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.800
Progress was clunky and riddled with
unexpected points of contention.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.920
For instance, their extreme literalism
combined with their rejection of evolution

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.800
produced a bizarre moment where we watch them
wrestle with the reality of flightless birds.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.520
Marcia just asserted that her god Jehovah
made fish to swim and birds to fly.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.220
to which I’d casually responded, ‘Well,
obviously not all birds.’

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.740
Uncontroversial enough, I thought. But apparently not.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.720
‘Yes!’ she affirmed, ‘All birds!’

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.500
Bemused, I said, ‘What about penguins?’

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.760
They were both completely stumped

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.420
The six weeks were littered
with these brick wall moments.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.980
The JW's consultations with their elders
didn't always produce answers.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.600
Where they did, the answers would prove
just as problematic and often downright strange.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.800
Regarding penguins, Penny and Marcia
came back with the response that

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.340
if you looked at penguins from under the water,
they would appear to be flying over you.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.340
It was a truly grown-worthy contortion.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.000
We put it to them: if flying meant swimming
and swimming flying

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.500
why differentiate between birds and fish at all?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.800
After all if you look at fish from under the water

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800
they'd appear to be flying over you too

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.560
as in fact would any swimming creature
— including humans.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.540
Were humans made the fly?

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.900
Cue silence.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.660
The Witnesses came to feel like carrier pigeons

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.260
flying — or maybe swimming —
between us and some unseen party

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.920
ferrying our responses.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.600
They were always confident that this
unseen party would have an answer.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.980
Halfway through their series of visits, another
witness — Sheila — was brought in to replace Marcia.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.900
Sheila, we were told, was much more adept
at these kinds of discussions.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.660
The carrier-pigeon routine persisted.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.220
As the weeks had gone by, Penny at least
had seemed to become a little more self-critical.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.460
She seemed to be processing
some of the reasons for our objections

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.320
and had even started spotting problems
in Marcia and Sheila's assertions.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.920
Sometimes, before me or my brother
could even respond to one of their assertions,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.120
Penny would turn to her fellow JW and awkwardly
point out the flaw in what they’d just said.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.240
And it was interesting to see how readily
they would concede the point to Penny

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.980
while never conceding a single point to us.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.240
To us, no ground was given.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.139
To us, their attitude was that if one of
our points couldn't be answered by them

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.579
it could always be answered by someone else.

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:48.339
With the unresolved problems piling higher and higher

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.060
one week they left us a book to read for next time

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.560
which they suggested would help answer our questions.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.599
It was a kind of JW FAQ

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.879
telling witnesses how to respond to
various questions and issues.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.140
For instance, if a ‘worldly’ person — ie a non-Witness —
asked why Jehovah allowed suffering

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.940
the book told JWs to explain that Jehovah
wasn't the ruler of the world. Satan was.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.240
Reading the book I recognised a lot of the arguments
Penny, Marcia and Sheila had already offered us.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.460
And suddenly their brick-wall moments
were put in a more illuminating perspective.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.340
These were often the moments when
we'd unwittingly taken them off-script.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.300
If giving us this book was an attempt by the JWs
to lighten their load, it backfired.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.280
We now had an avalanche of
new problems to discuss with them.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.200
When they arrived next week,
we got straight down to business

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.760
asking them about this claim that Jehovah had
given over his rulership of the world to Satan.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.640
In response, Penny launched clockwork into a rehearsed analogy about a teacher and a rebellious student.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.480
A teacher is explaining to his class
how to solve a problem in mathematics.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.420
But one of his students claims he has a better solution.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.600
and persuades some of the other students 
that they should listen to him.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.880
‘What should the teacher do?’ Penny asked rhetorically.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.620
She said the teacher could eject the
rebellious student then and there.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.540
But that might make the others think that
the teacher was afraid of challenge.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.960
So instead the teacher decides to give
his class over to the rebellious student.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.440
When it becomes clear that the
student’s mathematics don't add up

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.840
the others will come to see for themselves
that the teacher was right.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.780
Penny completed her script, announcing
that this was what Jehovah had done.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.200
When Adam and Eve had chosen
to listen to Satan instead of him

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.460
Jehovah had handed them
and the rest of humankind over to Satan

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.440
to demonstrate to them that his ways were wrong.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.880
In the christian denomination into which I'd been
indoctrinated, Satan had merely been an influence.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.800
The JWs’ elevation of Satan to ‘ruler
of the world’ was a new one on me.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.500
It was fascinating to hear their rationalisation
for Jehovah's abdication;

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.140
how they used this to absolve Jehovah
of responsibility for allowing human suffering.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.340
But their reasoning was a mess.

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.449
Allowing the student a little latitude on a maths problem

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:04.180
was in no way comparable to watching with arms
folded as centuries of human suffering play out.

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:07.909
To even up the picture a little,
I continued their teacher analogy.

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:11.829
What if the rebellious student started
inciting violence among the students?

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:15.389
Would it be ok for the teacher
to just stand by and watch

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.149
while students attacked their
classmates right in front of him?

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:20.789
Penny and Sheila agreed that it wouldn't be ok.

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:24.759
I suggested that if it was unacceptable
for the teacher to stand by and watch

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:29.079
the violent results of the student's incitements
then, according to their analogy,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:35.200
it was no less acceptable for Jehovah to stand by
and watch the violent results of Satan's incitements.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.340
But the problem went deeper than that.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.960
The Bible was o’erbrimming with divine interventions

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.260
most of which involved Jehovah
killing people for disobeying him —

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.320
including the flood, in which Jehovah
drowned all but a handful of humans.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.800
In fact, next to the genocidal Jehovah,

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.990
the Biblical Satan came across as relatively innocuous.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.660
For the JWS’ analogy to be accurate, not only would
the student have to incite his classmates to violence

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.480
but the teacher would also have
to constantly interject

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.720
killing students for disobeying him.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.920
To claim the Jehovah had handed over
rulership to Satan

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.639
when the Bible showed Jehovah continuing to impose
his own rule through incessant death penalties

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.360
was nonsense.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.180
After a lengthy silence

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.380
punctuated by the obligatory assurance that
it was good that we were challenging them to think

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.680
Penny and Sheila told us they’d
have to get back to us on that one.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.220
They never did.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.080
The JWs’ analogy was of course
flawed in many other respects.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.620
Modern teachers would have a hard time
recognising the classroom scene it depicted.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.400
What kind of teacher considers
himself unquestionably correct

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.230
so that before even hearing them

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.390
he dismisses his students’ alternative
ideas as necessarily wrong?

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.180
Students do sometimes surpass their teachers.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.330
If they didn't, our knowledge would never progress.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.200
What kind of teacher labels students 'rebellious'
for putting forward unconventional ideas?

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.980
Any conscientious teacher would encourage
students to think creatively.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.400
That's how we discover new solutions.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.680
And imagine the backlash from parents if it ever
emerged that a teacher had ejected a child

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.720
from a classroom, merely for
proposing an alternative solution.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.700
But in the JWs’ analogy, this initial option
was presented as if it was entirely reasonable.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.500
The JW's analogy bore no relation
to a modern classroom.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.740
But it did crystallise the mindset of our visitors

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.500
where the word of Jehovah —
conveyed of course by humans —

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.040
was considered unquestionably correct;

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.060
where thinking was considered an act of rebellion;

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.860
and where expulsion for thinking was
considered a perfectly fair-minded reaction.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.880
In the earthly life, this expulsion meant
shunning a member from the flock.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.339
In the afterlife, expulsion meant death.

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:48.119
In their final week, Sheila said it was
clear they weren't going to convert us

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.820
so they saw no point in continuing.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.120
At that stage it came as no surprise

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.500
that recruitment — rather than honest
discussion — had been their goal.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.820
At the door, we bid them a polite farewell.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.740
As she left, Sheila turned and gave a
reptilian smile, telling me:

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.180
‘Thinking themselves wise, they became fools.’

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.460
I recognised this is a Biblical quote from Roman 1:22.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.820
It was a rather shabby parting shot.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.460
Even Penny, who'd remained respectful throughout the discussions

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.580
looked distinctly embarrassed
by her ill-mannered colleague.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.380
I was tempted to respond with a verse we’d already
referenced when discussing the value of scepticism.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.360
Proverbs 14:15.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.940
‘The simple believe anything,
but the prudent given thought to their steps.’

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.360
But if it hadn’t been processed
when they were sat down at a table with us

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.180
there seemed little point in repeating it
as they were walking out the door.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.680
So I simply told them if that was the note
they wanted to end on, so be it —

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.930
and closed the door.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.970
So was it all a waste of time?

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.040
Learning about the JWs’ beliefs
and practices had limited value.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.440
Yes, there was some distinctive
quirks — there always are.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.460
And for many folks it’s those quirks
that they feel set them apart

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.660
as the authentic expression of their umbrella religion.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.740
For them, the devil is quite literally in the detail.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.340
But having been indoctrinated
into a christian denomination myself

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.380
it was pretty familiar territory.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:19.840
Nonetheless, it was good to hear it all from the horse's
mouth rather than from possibly misinformed sources.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.480
But the main value of the summer of
discussions lay in other areas.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.080
Three come to mind.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.400
Firstly, being my first serious discourse
with theists as an atheist,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.220
it disabused me of a lingering
idealistic fantasy of mine.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.600
My own process of deconversion from religious
indoctrination had aroused many feelings.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.120
Fear. Regret. Anxiety. Paralysis. Pain. Emptiness.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.660
It had been a disorientating
and exhausting transition.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.440
But throughout it all, I'd remained honest.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.580
I'd been prepared to ditch any
justifications for my faith

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.120
that were the product of fallacious reasoning.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.440
Initially, I assumed others would
be prepared to do the same.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.820
The reaction from my religious community
when I came out as an atheist

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.280
put a huge question mark over that assumption.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.920
Without exception, the former
fellow theists in my private life

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.220
who approached me about my non-belief
had all refused to hear me out,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.560
either shouting me down and insulting me

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.480
or pathologising me.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.160
For a long time, I fantasised that if any
of them had been prepared to sit down

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.960
to a calm, civil discussion,
things would have been different.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.440
But our discussions with the JWs really brought it
home to me that there was no reason to believe

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.780
that calmness and civility would
necessarily lubricate honesty.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.160
Secondly, our discussions prompted a greater
appreciation of the formidable denial

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.920
of which we humans were capable.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.200
That was simultaneously depressing and inspiring.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.920
Depressing because I realised that folks
in the grip of really powerful denial

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.480
could be rendered effectively unreachable.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.380
Like a passenger on the Titanic,
who refused to budge no matter what you said

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.160
because they’d been told categorically
by higher authorities than you

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.880
that it was unsinkable.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.320
Inspiring because it pushed me to learn
more about the mechanics of denial —

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.060
not least because I wanted to find ways of
recognising and challenging it in myself.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.260
the idea that I might ever be one of those
intransigent Titanic passengers was chilling.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.620
Thirdly, our discussions with
the JW's deepened my sense

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.740
of some of the tensions that would
run through my interactions with theists.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:26.920
The views the JWs had expressed had often
been immoral — sometimes downright hateful.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.340
But throughout the talks, I found myself
holding back from playing hardball.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.380
The JWs possessed a disarming vulnerability.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:40.640
In fact, the adjective that sprang to mind was
peculiarly apt: they seemed so .... unworldly.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.140
They were like children forced
to brandish antisocial banners,

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.140
expressing vicious messages they
demonstrably didn't understand.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.520
When challenged, all they had were
the hopelessly simplistic, fallacious scripts

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.640
drilled into them by their elders;

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.920
scripts that were easily debunked, beyond which point
they had no substantive material of their own to offer.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.240
Of course they weren't children. They were adults.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.700
And, as such, they were accountable for any message
or act of hate in which they participated.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.019
I don't subscribe to the pollyannish
idea that everyone is fundamentally good.

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:18.499
I think some folks have genuinely antisocial motives.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.500
But with Marcia, Sheila and particularly Penny,
my sense was that these were individuals

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.450
motivated by kindness and love.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.000
Unfortunately, they’d come under the
influence of a supremacist ideology

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.340
that taught them not only to dehumanise
swathes of other kind loving humans

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:40.180
but that dehumanising those humans
was in itself an act of kindness and love.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:45.420
Separating the pure from the impure;
preserving the godly body.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.920
These are the tensions I speak of.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:54.400
Experiencing the zealot’s hateful act while knowing
the misdirected love that often drives it.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.000
Tough to manage those kinds of tensions sometimes.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.420
Dehumanising can be infectious.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.580
When members of supremacist
ideologies dehumanise us

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.780
it's a natural reflex to dehumanise them right back;

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.220
to forget their humanity as they've forgotten ours.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.420
But that leaves us all brutalised, incurious

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.000
and with an impoverished understanding
of the complexity of human experience.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.560
For me, it's when we allow ourselves to
succumb to those kinds of unthinking reflexes

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.680
that we really do become fools.
