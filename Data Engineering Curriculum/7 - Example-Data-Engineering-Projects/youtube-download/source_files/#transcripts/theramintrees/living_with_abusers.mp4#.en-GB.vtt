00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.040
Many of us have lived with people we’d never
choose as house mates

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.200
— people we’ve found persistently disruptive,
argumentative, fussy, tactless.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.000
We’ve endured everything from encroachment
on personal space

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.820
to noise pollution

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.130
to unsolicited life coaching.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.680
Aggravating as this behaviour might be

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.820
there’s not necessarily
any malice behind it.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.300
Maybe a degree of self-absorption,
poor personal boundaries.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.140
Things tip over into abuse when the behaviour

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.360
becomes pervasively controlling and coercive.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.700
Control might mean tracking people’s movements

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.920
forcing their attendance at events

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.760
monitoring their phone calls, texts, emails

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.500
governing their financial transactions

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.470
dictating their physical appearance

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.429
including clothes, hairstyles, body shape

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.750
deciding who they can and can’t see

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.009
including forcing unwanted relationships on them

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.940
and sabotaging their independence.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.000
Coercive behaviour can involve threats
— real or implied

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.110
shaming and humiliation

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.110
raging

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.509
physical violence

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.260
and the destruction of property.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.119
Because of the corrosive impact of this behaviour

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.509
targets are frequently advised to minimise
or terminate contact

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.700
with controlling coercive individuals.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.360
It’s a simple equation.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.619
Fewer encounters means fewer opportunities
for abuse.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.460
But going low or no contact doesn’t always
feel possible.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.500
Many targets find themselves isolated

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.760
in situations where they can’t see an exit.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.300
Whether or not there actually are viable exits
becomes a moot point

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.770
if an individual isn’t able to see them.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.860
To be achieved they have to be perceived.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.080
Even when an exit emerges

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.310
targets sometimes find it suddenly blocked
by factors beyond their control.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.980
I’ve received messages from individuals

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.000
locked in with abusive fundamentalist families,
living in fear

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.960
or concerned about other relatives
in that situation.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.160
Others are being subjected to raging aggression

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.660
from disordered parents and partners.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.280
I want to look at the experience of living
with abusers

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.680
and offer some thoughts
on dealing with the poison.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.400
In particular I’ll be looking at some key
maladaptive habits to break

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.160
and some positive habits to cultivate.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.420
It’s important to make a realistic assessment
of abusers.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.040
What abusive behaviours have you witnessed
from them

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.160
—&nbsp;not just to you but to others?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.220
Are there any you would class as dangerous?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.140
How’s their impulse control?

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.400
Do they demonstrate the capacity to calm themselves?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.360
Or do they ride their rage
for all it’s worth?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.980
Where there’s a plausible physical threat

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.560
targets need to think seriously about taking
decisive action.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.220
Targets who don’t feel ready to call directly
on law enforcement

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.920
can access support and practical guidance
from other confidential services.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.000
Each country will have its own.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.260
In the UK, organisations include

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.160
Refuge, Women’s Aid, Victim Support,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.080
ManKind Initiative and Men’s Advice Line.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.400
Sometimes targets shy away from action
fearing retribution.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.260
But action and inaction both have significant risks.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.180
And in many cases, over time the risks of
doing nothing

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.099
substantially outweigh the risks of doing
something

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.440
as the abuser becomes more chaotic and lethal
with age.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.580
When children are involved, the risks are
further heightened.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.220
The threat of physical violence
isn’t always present.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.680
Sometimes the assault is psychological.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.280
Whatever form the abuse takes, it’s important
to break the silence.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.800
For targets who’ve been trained to hide
their abuse from the outside world

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.700
silence becomes a conditioned reflex;
a maladaptive habit.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.840
Aside from preventing targets reaching out
for support

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.400
silence has a more insidious psychological
effect.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.380
When something’s rendered unspeakable

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.740
it can become implicitly loaded with shame.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.860
It’s one of the perversities of abusive
situations

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.190
that targets take on the burden of shame

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.580
that rightfully belongs to their abusers.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.900
The act of speaking the unspeakable

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.560
works to counteract that shame.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.080
For that reason, any external acknowledgement
of the abuse

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.740
however small, can have value —

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.660
even the act of writing it in a private journal.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.060
Some targets have people in their personal
lives they feel they can talk to.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.030
For others who aren’t sure who they can trust

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.060
anonymous helplines offer the chance to be
heard in confidence.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.060
Anonymous online forums
can work in a similar way.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.240
It’s worth noting that abusers are sometimes
drawn to those forums.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.460
But it’s also worth noting that various
recent studies

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.180
support what many have long suspected —

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.919
that individuals who perpetrate cyberbullying

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.400
tend to show markedly low self-esteem.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.780
Contact with external support can carry risks.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.720
An anonymous correspondent who told me

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.060
he’d been confiding about his abuse with
a sympathetic friend

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.190
said he’d recently discovered his abuser

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.120
listening in on one of their phone calls.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.600
Some abusers go as far as using spyware.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.220
Maintaining your privacy around people who
routinely violate it

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.580
takes some careful and creative planning.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.660
Abusers often provoke strong emotional responses
in targets

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.220
—&nbsp;guilt, anger, fear, shame, contempt;

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.380
confusing combinations of the above.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.920
This works to the abuser’s advantage in
three ways.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.780
First, targets’ emotional responses act
as a constant demonstration

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.650
that their abuser has the power to affect them

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.530
to jerk them around, to keep them preoccupied
with the abuser.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.120
Second, arousing strong emotions keeps targets
off-balance

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.909
making it hard for them to think clearly and
respond rationally.

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.300
Many abusers keep targets on an emotional
merry-go-round

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.840
alternating vicious attacks with overblown
displays of love.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.650
Third, by responding emotionally

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.210
targets stay tangled up in the conflict

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.200
and can end up giving abusers more material
to use against them.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.360
Abusers can appear much larger

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.400
when viewed through an emotional lens.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.360
They seem to cast a long shadow

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.680
and seep into all areas of the target’s life.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.000
For these reasons, clinical detachment

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.629
is an important habit to cultivate —

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:20.860
the ability to stand back and view a situation
with a cold rational eye.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.520
Analysing abusers with clinical detachment

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.490
helps to cut them down to size

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.009
as targets begin to see them

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:32.140
as humans with specific identifiable inadequacies.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.620
It also helps to highlight the fact
that abusers fall

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.419
into a range of very different categories

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.340
with their own distinct driving motivations.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.020
Some instigate the abuse all by themselves.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.200
Some instigate it on the direction of others —

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.900
malignant cultural, political
and religious figures,

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.020
malignant scripture, malignant relatives.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.280
Abusers also lie on a spectrum from order
to chaos.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.759
While abusers at the ordered end might exhibit
various traits

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.180
associated with personality disorders

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.600
— like entitlement and
black-and-white thinking —

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.479
their abuse is often driven by dogmatic fixed ideas

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.380
rather than psychological disturbance.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.240
Authoritarian abusers demand strict compliance
to rules

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.840
at the expense of personal freedoms.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.740
If the rules are demeaning, tough.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.200
It’s all framework, no feeling.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.640
Attempts to challenge their rules are met
with tighter control.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.380
Some of them misguidedly believe their abuse

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.060
performs some virtuous social function;

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.520
that it instils moral discipline in their
targets

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.280
eradicating undesirable attributes

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.300
and, ultimately, building a better society.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.180
They treat their own pet theories

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.680
and personal preference as objective principles.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.540
If they suspect some activity

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.600
— like a creative or intellectual pursuit —

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.589
leads to what they view as moral degeneracy

00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:06.760
the activity is forbidden and punished.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.060
Unsubstantiated hunch becomes law.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.280
Because of this, they impose all kinds of
nonsensical rules

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.020
with no justification or explanation.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.960
As arbitrary as their ideas might be

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.510
they don’t bring the kind of chaos you find

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.950
with some malignant personality disorders.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.780
Many disordered abusers live in a land of
internal conflict and paradox.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.340
They despise targets, but need their affirmation.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.880
They crave praise, but question its sincerity
when they receive it.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.620
They can’t stand solitude, but can’t bear
the company of authentic people.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.670
In short, they want to be surrounded by individuals

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.960
who are devoid of personal needs.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.460
When it comes to categorising abusers

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.920
things aren’t always what they seem.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.360
An abuser might appear to be submitting to
the directions of another agent

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.160
— for example following the dictates of
some tyrannical scriptural god —

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.720
when in fact they’re just using
that other agent

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.570
as a front for their own cruelty.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.600
Targets might want to believe everything would
be okey

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.630
if they could just get the abuser away from
the malignant influence.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.630
But the abuser is the malignant influence.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.430
For targets who suspect their abuser has a
personality disorder

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.230
learning about signs and symptoms

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.060
of antisocial, histrionic, borderline and
narcissistic disorders

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.000
can offer some insight into their experiences.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.020
But there are pitfalls to keep in mind.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.440
Distinguishing between disorders isn’t always
straightforward

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.360
and it’s easy to become invested
in a flawed diagnosis.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.880
If that happens, targets can start projecting
qualities

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.320
onto their abuser that don’t exist.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.720
And missing ones that do.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.720
Abusers can also exhibit comorbidity

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.440
meaning they possess a combination of pathologies.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.820
For these kinds of reasons, it’s wise not
to get overly concerned

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.100
with diagnostic terms
but to keep a rigorous focus

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.720
on the abuser’s actual behaviour.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.660
And ‘behaviour’ is the operative term.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.560
With abusers, words and actions often conflict.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.660
The actions reveal the person.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.560
Cultivating clinical detachment

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.430
not only helps to determine
the abuser’s nature

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.800
it also helps targets clarify their own thinking.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.020
Many targets are susceptible to all kinds

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.340
of wishful thinking and confirmation bias.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.620
It’s understandable —&nbsp;especially when
their abusers

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.180
are people they’ve loved and hoped to be
loved by.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.040
There can be a huge temptation to deny or
minimise the problem

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.269
or fantasise that their abusers will see the
error of their ways

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:54.800
and transform into a decent human being.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.779
These fantasies, hopes and denials all work

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.400
to keep targets stuck in the abuse.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.820
Only when we’re working with good information

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.680
can we expect to respond effectively to a
situation.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.960
Erasing illusions helps to establish psychological
separation.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.019
Targets who previously saw themselves

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:17.910
as trapped inside their abuser’s dysfunctional world

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.600
begin to realise they’re
living next to someone

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.640
who’s trapped inside
their own dysfunctional world.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.900
Even when targets start seeing their abusers

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.320
for who they really are

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.460
it can take a while for some of their own
counterproductive habits to die off.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.660
But over time the absurdity of those habits
become increasingly clear.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.400
If targets could see how their words were
fragmented

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.560
into total garbage by their abuser’s selective
hearing

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.990
made to fit whatever fantasy happened to be
flying

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.010
through the abuser’s head at that moment

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.940
they’d soon stop making any effort.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.760
They’d stop trying to reason with unreasoning
individuals;

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.560
appealing for fairness from people

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.020
who equate fairness with personal disadvantage;

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.120
wanting to be understood by individuals

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.780
who exercise control by misunderstanding;

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.940
being open and earnest with Machiavellian
manipulators

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.320
who have one use for personal information:
ammunition.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.500
These habits come under the heading:
‘speaking a dead language’.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.820
For abusers all these languages

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:36.420
— reason, fairness,
understanding and honesty —

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.839
undermine their power position
by providing a path

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.740
to truth and accountability.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.700
They take refuge in other languages

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:53.560
— non sequiturs, double talk, word salad
and bare-faced lies —

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.040
to maintain their corrupted sense of power.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.900
An anonymous correspondent
told me how her abuser

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:05.440
would repeatedly make not-so-subtle innuendos
and insinuations.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.380
When directly confronted, the abuser would
play innocent

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.560
and protest she was misunderstood.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.500
These exchanges were described as unnerving
and exhausting.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.760
Many targets will instantly recognise this tactic

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.120
which is a particular favourite among more
fragile abusers

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.800
who prefer covert indirect forms of attack.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.720
It’s so common, it even has a name: DARVO.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.339
This acronym lays out the sequence of events

00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:38.199
that happens when abusers instigate an offence

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.300
and get confronted by their target.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.340
First, they deny the offence

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.940
sometimes concocting
groan-worthy cover-up stories.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.400
Then they go on the attack by playing the
wounded party themselves

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.700
reversing the roles of victim and offender.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.260
This role-switching element — sometimes
called the ‘cross up’ —

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.800
is a signature component
of psychological games

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.300
leaving the target in a spin.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.500
Role-switching games come in many forms.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.000
Some games start with abusers trying to put
the target in the role of ‘rescuer’.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.139
They might put themselves down

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.100
or complain about other people attacking them.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.460
The target is then expected
to leap to the rescue.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.760
But any attempts to support the abuser are
never quite good enough.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.139
Eventually the abuser switches from victim
to persecutor

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.740
turning on the target — who gets flipped
from rescuer to victim.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.960
Abusers are like porcupines, loaded with hooks.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.220
And targets repeatedly turn up
wearing chain mail —

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.580
suits of chunky metal rings
waiting to be hooked.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.779
This image reflects how targets often invest

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:50.680
in maladaptive strategies around abusers

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.340
which just get them more entangled.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.420
Each of the rings in the chain mail

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.690
could be thought of as a reflex response

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.840
that can be exploited by the abuser.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.820
Examples might include
the instinct to fend off insults;

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.740
to protest against false allegations;

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.080
to insist on due credit when it’s denied.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.480
The problem with reflex responses is that
they’re fixed and unthinking.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.840
They don’t adapt to different conditions.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.199
In fair-minded rational company

00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:25.240
these reflex responses might work very effectively

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.980
as social nudges that prevent conflict escalation.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.200
In the Bizarro world of abusers

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.800
these reflexes have the opposite effect

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.520
drawing targets into conflict escalation.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.740
Unhooking ourselves from these conflicts

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.900
involves stepping back
and examining our own responses.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.780
When we become aware
of our fixed mindless reflexes

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.620
we can start to replace them with flexible
mindful reflection.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.700
We can control our responses instead of being
controlled by them.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.360
Instead of mindlessly reacting to abusers’
insults

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.970
we can mindfully recognise they just want
to feed off our reaction

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.160
and we can choose to disengage.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.500
If abusers attempt to draw us into false competition

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.440
negatively comparing our attributes and achievements

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.839
to those of their own or other people

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.900
we can choose to detach from those comparisons.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.500
If abusers attempt to smear us to reasonable
fair-minded people

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.659
we can choose to assert our innocence to those
reasonable people

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.900
and mindfully choose not to confront the abuser.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.740
As we start recognising the abuser’s hooks

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.010
we can even put names to them.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.510
Inwardly, we register to ourselves:

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.030
Ah, that’s the competition hook!

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.980
Ah, that’s the false accusation hook!

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.659
Piece by piece, the chain mail
of automatic reflexes

00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:59.330
that previously weighed us down fades away

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.500
allowing the freedom
to step away from the games.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.940
In avoiding one hook, it’s easy to walk
straight into another.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.740
Stepping away from the games means

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.200
not fighting to get the upper hand.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.670
But it also means not making a big display

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.020
of showing the abuser you’re not fighting
to get the upper hand —

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.660
which, let’s be honest,
is just another way

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.680
of fighting to get the upper hand.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.040
The aim is to offer as little as possible;

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.000
to display no emotion; volunteer no opinion.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.480
Just give bland vague responses.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.620
This method of handling hooks
is called ‘grey rock’

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:43.180
because it’s about making yourself as uninteresting
and unengaging as a grey rock.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.660
But there are some points to bear in mind
when using it.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.320
There might be a temptation
to let abusers know

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.600
you’re deliberately grey-rocking them;

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.070
to rub it in their faces.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.700
Besides instantly nullifying the method

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.220
this can inspire more focussed abuse.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.960
High levels of exposure to abusers can mean

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.920
lots of grey rock interactions.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.960
As a result, some targets might occasionally feel

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.960
a little emotionally disconnected.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.060
To reconnect, it’s helpful for targets

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.800
to identify the things that recharge them.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.240
It could be music, nature,
physical activity —

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.020
whatever brings them vividly to life.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.280
Grey rock might sometimes involve pragmatic
gestures of concession.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.790
For example, if an abuser compares you unfavourably
with other people

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.280
there might be times when, instead of responding
in a neutral way

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.320
you might choose to agree.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.280
This agreement isn’t about
pleasing the abuser

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.700
or putting yourself down.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.080
It’s about freeing yourself.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.020
Allowing yourself to express genuine agreement

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.900
can be a great help in ridding yourself of
reflex defensiveness.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.640
If the grey rock responses are too abrupt

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.300
it can attract attention
instead of reducing it.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.700
Sometimes it’s useful to use a variation
I call beige rock.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.539
Here the target’s responses have a little
more colour

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:10.750
to make them less severe.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.740
It might mean using fuller sentences

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.059
instead of monosyllabic shrugs

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:17.890
and allowing slightly longer interactions

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.980
instead of making swift exits.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.659
When we begin to navigate living with abusers
more effectively

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.580
we might feel a swell of compassion for them.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.300
As their hold on us wanes we become charitable,
magnanimous

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.260
especially if we discover our abusers

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.710
were themselves abused in the past

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.360
or if they seem to show a degree

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.160
of self-awareness and remorse.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.180
A word of caution.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.600
We are not our abusers’ therapists.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.659
Attempting to take on any responsibility for
their rehabilitation

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.480
can be the prelude to more abusive games.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.860
Some abusers ask their target to tell them

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.480
when they’re behaving unreasonably.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.300
This might seem like a positive request.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.440
But when the target later points out some
unreasonable behaviour

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.620
the game is revealed —

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:13.020
the abuser uses the criticism to start a fight.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.120
When abusers claim to see
the error of their ways

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.490
and express a desire to change

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.950
for many targets, it’s exactly what they
want to hear

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.500
and there’s a big temptation to let their
guard down

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.020
gush openly about their feelings

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.420
and talk about a new start together.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.900
Unfortunately many targets discover too late

00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:36.870
that it was all a ploy for the abuser

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.500
to find out what they were really thinking.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.760
When abusers claim to have some personal epiphany

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.520
targets are wise to maintain their guard,
if not raise it.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.300
It’s not cruel or mean to distrust people

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.140
who’ve repeatedly destroyed your trust.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.120
It’s rational and healthy.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.840
Abusers who profess a desire to change

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.659
can demonstrate their sincerity

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.180
by taking full responsibility for that change.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.179
Targets are well advised to stand back

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.400
and stay focussed on their own development.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.560
Even in cases of genuine change

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.140
the ground might just be too scorched for
trust to ever grow.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:24.800
In those cases, it’s up to abusers to live
with the distrust they’ve created.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.940
‘What hurt the most
wasn’t the actual abuse.’

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.100
‘It was the fact that when I finally started
talking about it ….’

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.380
’….no one wanted to listen.’

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.540
During my therapeutic work and conversations
with targets of abuse

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.920
that sentiment’s been repeatedly voiced.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.760
Some individuals go through life believing

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.110
that if they ever reported being abused

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.380
their loved ones — friends, relatives or
partners —

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.180
wouldn’t hesitate to support them.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.660
Thankfully, many individuals will never have
to put that belief to the test.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.920
Sadly, many others will discover the human
safety net

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.900
they believed would catch them doesn’t exist.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.960
When they finally share their story

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.260
their loved ones’ response is to back away.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.570
While it might start to feel like a deliberate
conspiracy

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:23.430
it generally comes down to a jumble of common
human shortcomings.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:28.600
Apathy — some people just want a quiet life
with no complications.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.320
Pride —&nbsp;some have been long-term supporters
of the abuser

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.440
and refuse to believe they’ve been fooled.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.659
Fear — some have a sense
of the abuser’s  nature

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.640
and don’t want to become a target themselves.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.080
Ignorance —&nbsp;some lack the experience or
imagination

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.380
to absorb what they’re being told.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.100
The net result is that targets are left in
no doubt:

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.060
they’re on their own.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.360
Going it alone places an uncommon burden on
targets.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.400
As a social species, we’re geared to interact
productively with others.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.899
Through the responses we receive from others

00:24:06.899 --> 00:24:10.559
we get constant feedback about how we’re
being perceived

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.340
which in turn shapes our self-perception.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.220
We act as ‘reality reflectors’
to each other.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.620
In healthy situations where we experience

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.080
decent volumes of good-quality rounded feedback

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.140
we gain and maintain a strong sense of ourselves.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:33.860
In abusive situations, where the feedback
is grossly distorted or negating

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:39.020
targets can develop a grossly distorted or
empty sense of self.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.260
To achieve anything approaching a healthy
sense of self

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.929
targets of abuse have to take extra measures

00:24:44.929 --> 00:24:49.020
to correct the constant bogus feedback they receive.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.980
The analogy I often return to

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.570
is that targets are continually being drip-fed

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.220
from the abuser’s poison well.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:01.800
To dilute the poison, targets have to cultivate
their own clear healthy wells.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.200
And the more wells the better.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.960
Each well represents a source
of healthy reality reflection

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.680
through which targets can gain a clearer stronger
sense of self.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.020
Some of the best sources of healthy reflection
can be other people.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.760
Having just one individual in your personal life

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.580
who sees things clearly can make all the difference
in combating the poison.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.039
Another kind of human well might be an online
community

00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:30.220
who shares similar experiences.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.299
For many targets, listening to other people’s stories

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.340
can be a powerful detox.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.640
And it’s not uncommon for targets to go
through

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.420
periods of binge-watching abuse-related videos.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.080
It’s not about wallowing in misery.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.940
It’s about bathing in the acknowledgement
of reality.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:53.840
Finally, they’re hearing their own previously
denied experiences reflected back.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.340
They’re not going mad. They’re not invisible.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.640
There are people out there
who know what goes on

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.640
behind closed doors and don’t want
to twist it or silence it.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.880
Recording our lives in a journal or video diary

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.510
creates another kind of well

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.740
reminding us that the past really happened.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.580
Personal interests&nbsp;make great wells.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:20.540
Physical activities, fields of study,
creative pursuits.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.200
These things contribute to our sense

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.080
of being a distinct person with our own tastes.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.860
Of course individuality isn’t something
abusers are keen to encourage

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.040
and it’s wise to anticipate some sabotage.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.920
As a child I got into drawing superhero comics.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.420
When I was around seven I decided to write
a complete comic.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.760
For weeks I stuck to my goal of drawing a
page every night

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.640
until one night it was done.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.200
When I proudly took it down to show my parents

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.820
my narcissist mother flicked through it briefly
then ripped it up.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.120
It didn’t meet with her personal vision.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.660
Abusers often work to inhibit, disrupt or
destroy

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.620
whatever the target shows interest in.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:14.100
Some targets&nbsp;learn —&nbsp;like I did — to
pursue their interests in private.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.740
Those who do persist and develop some skills

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.049
will sometimes experience
another twist in later life

00:27:20.049 --> 00:27:23.200
when their abuser attempts to rewrite history

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.940
and take credit for encouraging and nurturing
those skills.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.760
Sadly in the face of aggressive opposition

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.220
many targets just give up on their interests
completely

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.910
helping to starve them of their individuality.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:43.149
Digging for metaphorical water
can take hard work

00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:45.660
just like digging for real water.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.299
Finding and maintaining good reliable sources

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.280
can feel like a struggle at first

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.280
but gets easier with time and practice.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.279
The more interests we develop

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.400
the more facets of ourselves we recover
and discover.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.540
For my brother and I

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.500
the poison well we grew up next to was deep
and wide.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:12.000
Endless psychological traps, outlandish accusations,
constant violent rages.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.600
We can look back and remember
it all very clearly.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.140
But it didn’t define our childhoods.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.120
What defined our childhoods

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.549
—&nbsp;and what we endlessly recall together
with laughter and affection —

00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:29.659
were the multiple healthy wells we cultivated
for ourselves

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.520
that pushed the poison to the sidelines.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.480
When we’re replacing old habits
with new ones

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.490
we sometimes feel conflicted

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.680
even if we’re trying to improve our situation.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.659
Any change —&nbsp;positive or negative —

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.980
can arouse mixed feelings
or unexpected resistance within us.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.600
Portia Nelson’s poem ‘Autobiography in
five short chapters’

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.900
perfectly captures the confusion of the process.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.299
In chapter one, you’re walking down a street

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.560
when you fall down a hole in the sidewalk.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.220
It takes ages to make your way out.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.040
In chapter two you walk down the same street.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.020
You pretend to yourself
that you can’t see the hole

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.240
—&nbsp;and you fall down it again.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.540
You don’t know why.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.700
Again, it takes you a long time to climb out.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.780
In chapter three you walk down the same street.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.100
There’s no pretending now. You see the hole.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.040
And you still fall into it.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.060
But you can see it’s your own fault now —

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.580
something you’re doing to yourself
out of habit.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.340
You climb out fast.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.700
In chapter four you walk down the same street.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.559
Finally you walk around the hole.

00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:58.210
At last, you’ve absorbed the lesson.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:03.620
In chapter five
you walk down a different street.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.380
Some of us will eventually exit the abusive
environment.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.020
We’ll start new lives
with a strict door policy.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.460
But whether we do or not

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.640
there’s no need to put our lives on hold

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.020
while we happen to be living with abusers.
