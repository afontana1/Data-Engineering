00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.000
Thomas and Uma are lifelong supporters of
a major political party in their country.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.260
After five years together, 
they have their first child, Ben.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.120
They invite their friends and family to a
ceremony where the baby’s hand is painted

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.840
in the party colour and
pressed against a ballot paper.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.720
The assembled company cheers its approval
and a minister joyfully announces

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.660
that their political party has just
gained its newest member.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.980
There’s a photographic frenzy to capture
this wonderful moment in Ben’s life.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.480
Year after year, Ben will be taken to weekly
meetings in which he’ll be made to listen

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.680
to speeches and sing songs
praising the party leadership.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.060
Each week, Ben will made to join in with a
election ritual, lining up at a booth

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.340
and voting publicly for the party,
then sipping celebratory champagne.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.120
The same messages will be drilled into Ben
as facts over and over and over and over again.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.440
The party leader is always right.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.020
Those who rebel against the leader
will suffer terrible consequences.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.700
Only devoted members will enjoy a good life.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.320
The messages will be further reinforced when
Ben is sent to a conviction school

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.140
with curriculums designed to keep the students’
political convictions in line with the party ideology.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.100
At school, as with all other public spaces,
he will be made to wear party colours.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.200
As his reasoning skills develop, some of what
Ben hears about the leader will seem nonsensical

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.460
contradictory

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.900
even hypocritical.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.220
At first, he’ll voice these problems unselfconsciously.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.280
But he’ll be reminded that the party is
perfect, so his criticisms must be wrong.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.129
He’ll further be accused of ‘sacrilege’ and
warned of harsh consequences for such talk.

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:07.809
Ben will feel guilty, scared and isolated.

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:11.620
Critical thoughts about his party
will now arouse anxiety in him.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.400
He’ll learn to dismiss his misgivings
as the product of his own ignorance.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.160
Before long, he’ll learn
to block them out altogether.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.400
Conversely, he’ll learn
that compliance gets rewarded.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.520
When he does as he’s told, affirms his political
loyalty, raises funds for the party, and so on

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.040
he’ll be showered with approval and praise,
strongly encouraging more of the same behaviours

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.440
and deepening his sense of identity
as a party member.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.340
In his thirteenth year,
in a special public ceremony

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.740
Ben will confirm his lifelong commitment
to the party leadership

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.480
promising always to campaign and vote for the party

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.500
and affirming that he makes these vows
entirely of his own free will.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.550
Thomas and Uma will look on with pride, 
thrilled that their son made the right choice.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.890
They will genuinely believe
they gave their son a choice.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.350
I suspect very few of us would have any difficulty
recognising this hypothetical scenario as abusive.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.440
I suspect that if politicians tried to encourage
this kind of childhood induction into their parties

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.520
there would be huge public outrage.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.040
So why is it that many of us will accept all
of the above abuse when it comes to religion?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.040
The induction of babies as party members.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.920
The manipulation of children through endlessly
repeated promises, threats, rhetoric and rituals

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.590
they’re are not equipped to evaluate or resist.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.200
The further encroachment on children through
schools, which should be places of education.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.780
Not proselytisation.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.720
How is it possible to hold two such wildly
conflicting sets of attitudes

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.360
towards the same phenomenon of child indoctrination?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.000
Protective toward the child in regard to politics.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.280
Protective toward the indoctrinator in regard to religion.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.180
Child religious indoctrination stands out
as one of the most systematic, self-perpetuating

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.060
forms of abuse humans perpetrate on others.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.329
I want to go through some of the arguments
put to me over the years by its defenders.

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.980
With each one, I invite the viewer to reflect
on how legitimate that argument would seem

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.450
if it was submitted in support of Ben’s
political indoctrination.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.110
I’ll also be presenting a thought experiment
that might help bring the point home.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.160
Over the years, some apologists have argued
that ‘indoctrinate’ is just another word for teach.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.410
Well, open a dictionary and yes, under ‘indoctrinate’

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.640
you’ll find the verb’s archaic definition
of ‘teach or instruct’.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.000
But the modern usage means to teach someone
to accept a set of beliefs uncritically

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.080
which is a very different business.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.760
And it’s the business religious indoctrinators are in

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.100
where religious beliefs are taught to children as truth

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.120
deeply colouring their view of reality

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.640
and where reactions to criticism
range from expressions of disapproval

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.080
to physical punishments
to threats of eternal damnation.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.660
Religious indoctrination
actively encourages ignorance

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.420
unlike teaching which encourages knowledge.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.900
For example, it discourages the investigation
of competing religions.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.580
Some children are simply not told
about their existence.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.200
Some will hear competing religions
explicitly denounced as corrupt

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.400
and will be forbidden to talk about them.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.380
Obviously, if children were taught without
bias about all religions from the get-go,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.780
they might not be so easily herded into the
one laid out for them.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.480
To those who want to characterise religious indoctrination as teaching,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.540
imagine a school where the drama teachers
only ever discuss the works of Harold Pinter

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.000
to the exclusion of all other playwrights;

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
where the music teachers proclaim
Sergei Prokofiev as the true composer

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.280
dismissing&nbsp;any others as corrupt;

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.500
where the maths teachers threaten to behead
students who draw cartoons of Blaise Pascal.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.140
Would you call that teaching?

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.380
More to the point,
would you send your child there?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.440
Indoctrinate does not just mean teach.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.600
Indoctrinators sometimes claim they’re
performing a service for the child.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.180
I’ve had christian apologists tell me they’re ....

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.360
‘helping the child find its christian identity.’

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.360
Paints a philanthropic picture doesn’t it?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.240
It's as if there’s some precious christian identity
hidden deep inside the child

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.740
that it’ll struggle to find by itself.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.400
So the indoctrinator kindly steps in to offer assistance.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.820
But what would we think of political indoctrinators
who claimed they were ....

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.300
‘helping the child find its Democrat identity’?

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.780
Or ‘its Conservative identity?’

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.820
Would it seem like they were doing
the child a service —&nbsp;or themselves?

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.680
What if adults said they were ....

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.420
‘helping the child find its accountant identity’?

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.260
.... ‘its heterosexual identity’?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
.... ‘its violinist identity’?

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
.... ‘its stamp-collector identity’?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.420
We don’t ‘help children find their identity’
by imposing identities on them of our choosing.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.120
We help by exposing them to the rich variation
and complexity of human life

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.940
educating them about all their options,
and letting them discover their own identity.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.020
Indoctrination is not act of philanthropy.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.000
Neither is it an act of love.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.300
On the 2nd of February 2015,
going home from school

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.940
a six-year-old boy from Missouri was reportedly 
coaxed into a pickup truck by a 23-year-old man.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.020
According to news accounts, the boy was
then told he’d never see his family again

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.160
and would be ‘nailed to the wall of a shed’

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.200
— and threatened with a gun
when he wouldn’t stop crying.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.720
When they reached their destination, the boy was
reportedly tied up, taken to a basement

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.200
partially stripped by a woman, and told
he could be sold into ‘sex slavery’.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.300
The twist?

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.310
The woman was his aunt.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.310
The man was her co-worker.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:28.450
Together with the boy’s mother and grandmother, 
they felt the boy was too trusting around strangers.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.350
So they staged the kidnapping to teach him
not to talk to people he didn’t know.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.800
When the boy told a teacher about his experience,
he was taken into protective custody.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.080
A lawyer representing the adults
stated that their actions ....

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.320
‘were born out [of] an intense
and sincere love for the child

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.580
and the desire to protect him from others
by teaching him to protect himself’

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.700
The adults were charged with various offences

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.900
including abuse of a child,
kidnapping and felonious restraint.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.860
Some apologists cite their
personal fear for their child’s soul

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.760
as a justification for inspiring anxiety
and terror in their children

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.700
with threats of exclusion from paradise and
banishment to a realm of unending torture.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.380
Both the Missouri abduction defence and this
religious indoctrination defence

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.020
show how over-protective feelings
can easily lead to destructive actions,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.080
when individuals become so fixated
on averting some perceived danger

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.900
that they don’t consider what damage
they themselves might be doing in the process.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.920
It’s not a loving act to hold a child
so tight you crush its bones.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.560
In the case of both the Missouri abduction
and religious indoctrination

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.200
alternative non-abusive courses of action exist.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.300
The Missouri abductors could have
used role-play games

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.440
getting the boy to fend off
various approaches by strangers.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.100
They could’ve taught him a code word
only given to trusted strangers.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.440
They could’ve asked for advice from teachers,
psychologists, child protection agencies,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.720
even the police.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.760
A range of non-abusive options were available.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.620
Likewise, indoctrination isn’t
the only option available

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.500
if you want to convince your child
of your religious beliefs.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.200
A non-abusive alternative is simple argumentation.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.600
Let your child learn about all religions
— and the option of choosing none.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.720
Teach it without preference. Take it to a range
of services conducted by different religions.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.780
Take it to a humanist assembly to show that
fellowship isn’t the exclusive province of religions.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.920
Let your child learn about logic and logical fallacies;

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.000
about syllogistic reasoning;
about soundness and validity.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.040
Give it practice to build its competence
and confidence in legitimate argumentation.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.300
Let your child learn about manipulation through
emotional appeals and displays of raw conviction

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.470
so that it learns to see through to the substance
of the underlying claims.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.910
Teach it about all the psychological
biases we humans possess

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.340
that can affect the way
we process information and ideas.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.320
In short, do everything you can to help equip
your child with critical thinking skills

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.320
and immunise it against exploitation.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.620
Then make your case for your religion.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.620
Have an honest exchange with your child

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.240
presenting all the reasons
you think it should believe what you believe.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.140
And now comes the important part.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.720
Let your child think for itself.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.980
Those who’re confident they have good reasons
for their religious beliefs

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.300
should have no problem using argumentation
instead of indoctrination.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.440
Those who’re not confident they have good reasons

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.000
shouldn’t be contemplating indoctrination
or argumentation.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.560
Their best plan is to try and figure out why they
themselves hold beliefs they can’t substantiate.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.820
Many argue that religious indoctrination teaches
the child moral values.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.620
This instantly falls flat on its face, when we ask:

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.820
Can children be taught moral values without indoctrination?

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.020
The answer is yes.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.120
To justify indoctrination as an acceptable method
of teaching moral values,

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.560
the apologist would have to show that the invasive and coercive tactics used in indoctrination

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.900
were necessary to get the job done.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.500
The fact these tactics are not necessary
makes them excessive.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.060
Now, that’s all I actually need to say to debunk this defence.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.240
But, like indoctrination, I’m going to be excessive.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.800
I want to take a deeper look at this claim
of teaching moral values.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.660
The stamp of divine authorship often gets
tacked on to precepts like:

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.260
‘don’t lie’, ‘don’t steal’,
‘treat others as we would be treated’.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.140
But these rules of thumb all have secular roots.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.120
They work because they offer ideas
on personal boundaries and personal bonding

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.700
that help social creatures co-exist.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.720
I call them rules of thumb —&nbsp;not ‘moral absolutes’
as dogmatic religions like to present them —

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.480
because the fact is they shouldn’t always be followed.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.480
Lying can be a moral act
where it protects people from persecution.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.920
Even the golden rule doesn’t always hold.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.880
If I enjoy confrontations, it doesn’t mean I should
go round treating others in a confrontational way.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.800
Religions are not the source of any moral value,
but frequently the source of immoral ones.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.620
In Christianity’s Bible, we find the
christian creator god Yahweh

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:57.460
depicted ordering execution for picking up sticks on the wrong day, and for sons who resist their parents.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:03.000
Humans are instructed to burn to death any
priest’s daughter who becomes a sex worker;

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and to stone to death any woman shown not
to be a virgin on her wedding night.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.740
Biblical punishments range from the overblown
to the inadequate to the bizarre

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.960
such as stoning an ox to death for goring a human.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.220
Throughout history, humans’ve been killed in excessively sadistic ways

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.900
by groups ranging from drug cartels
to religious communities to governments

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.460
as a warning to others.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.080
But what can the stoning of an ox
teach the ox community?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.540
This is bloodlust.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.300
A very human phenomenon.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.400
A very Biblical phenomenon.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.360
But not a moral one.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.940
It’s been put to me that
belief in gods is in itself a moral value

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.620
because it adds the weight of supernatural authority to moral instruction

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.500
helping to ensure the individual’s moral compliance.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.880
But belief in gods adds weight
to any instruction —&nbsp;moral or immoral.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.820
Instructions to withhold
medical treatment from children.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.440
Instructions to mutilate their genitals.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.580
Beliefs that help to ensure compliance to any instruction
have no intrinsic moral value.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.780
In defending indoctrination, some people cite
the sincerity of their beliefs.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.780
The argument posits that
if someone believes something sincerely

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.600
then they should be free to act
in accordance with that belief.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.220
For those who don’t quite grasp it,
let’s see the principle in action.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.140
Vivian gets a job at a bank.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.740
On her first day, she refuses to serve Asian customers.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.300
When they complain to her manager that they want her sacked,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.540
Vivian reveals that she believes Asians are
an inferior slave race who don’t deserve money.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.460
Her manager is outraged.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.600
But then Vivian tells him her beliefs are sincere

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.460
and have been held by her family for generations.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.380
Hearing this, he suddenly realises
there’s no problem after all.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.880
Vivian keeps her job and her manager puts up
a sign by her desk saying ‘No Asians’

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.800
so she’ll never be put in this awkward position again.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.980
Make sense now?

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.080
This is the kind of convoluted
nonsense you get into

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.000
when beliefs are indulged
on the basis of sincerity rather than content.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.040
‘Sincerely held beliefs’ has become
a buzz-phrase in religious discourse

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.920
designed to bypass objections to unreasonable,
selfish and abusive behaviours.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.360
But it has no more substance than the plea
of the child who complains to its parent

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.060
‘But I really want it!’

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.360
Some apologists claim indoctrinated children remain ‘free to think’.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.000
Some of them reject
the power of indoctrination altogether

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.260
suggesting ‘children will grow up
to believe what they want anyway’.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.280
How disingenuous can you get?

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.840
Indoctrinators know full well that if they succeed
in dominating the child’s mind in the first few years

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.180
there’s every chance the beliefs they implant will stick.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:41.320
It’s spelled out in the familiar vow attributed to both
Aristotle and Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier:

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.510
‘Give me a child until he is seven
and I will show you the man.’

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.090
This statement shows a clear understanding

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.680
that these first few years
offer an opportunity like no other.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.260
In these early years, children are developing
their conceptual models of how the world works.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.120
If ideas are injected at this stage,
they’ll stand a great chance

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.020
of becoming an essential part
of how the individual views reality.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.500
Injecting ideas in a child’s mind is child’s play.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.020
All kinds of outlandish stories can be presented 
as fact by adults — and they’ll be believed

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.680
with the total trust typical of infancy.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.480
Freedom to think requires the ability to think;
to appraise what you’re told.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.700
Very young children are incapable of this.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.660
Evidence that they’re later becoming capable
comes when they starts asking awkward questions

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.280
showing they’re not merely swallowing
what they’re being handed

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.800
but beginning to process the material critically.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.180
But as I’ve already noted, indoctrination
demands uncritical acceptance.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.280
These questions are not welcomed

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.760
and indoctrinators use a range of power-based manipulations and punitive measures to silence them

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.000
— including warnings about ‘blasphemy’.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.540
These induce guilt and anxiety in the child
and very effectively stop thought.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.060
So much for being ‘free to think’.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.520
Having groomed the child’s mind to accept
the religious ideology

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:05.280
the indoctrinator can now exploit a well-documented human quirk: the desire for consistency.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.780
I explore this phenomenon in depth
in my video ‘bending truth’.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.700
Humans have a powerful aversion to contradictions.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.080
When we experience two conflicting beliefs or ideas

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.900
one will have to be distorted or
denied in some way to resolve that conflict.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:25.100
And unfortunately, research shows the outcome
has little to do with a concern for truth.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.560
What we strive for is consistency.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.520
And when we have a heavy personal investment
in one of the contradictory ideas

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.000
the outcome is loaded from the start.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.460
The police knock at Karen’s door. They’ve come
to arrest her son on several counts of murder.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.140
Karen is faced with two contradictory ideas.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.910
Her son’s alleged guilt and her belief in his innocence.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.980
We could think of these ideas like boxes.
Karen has a ton of investment in the innocent box.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:56.440
Years of complex memories and experiences
and intense feelings of love and protectiveness.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.600
In contrast, she has no investment in the guilty box.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.260
Karen doesn’t know any details yet,
but dismisses the whole thing as police incompetence.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.960
She knows her son.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.960
Karen’s sure she can provide an alibi.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.220
But when she looks through her calendar she sees
her son was out on hunting trips with a friend

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.000
on all of the murder dates.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
She puts it down to coincidence.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.580
In court, a victim who got away
identifies her son as his attacker.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.380
But she knows the man’s lying or mistaken.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.980
She knows her son.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.160
Various videos are found on her son’s computer

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.680
in which he appears with his hunting buddy
who’s seen torturing and killing animals.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.300
Karen is shocked, but it’s obviously
all down to her son’s friend.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.800
Then more videos are found. Both boys are
clearly seen torturing and killing the murder victims

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.580
and laughing at their work.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.220
Karen can’t make sense of what she’s seeing.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.140
But she knows there must be some explanation.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.140
She knows her son.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.780
When we become heavily invested in a belief,

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.320
we don’t just happily give it up
when we’re faced with inconsistent facts.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.760
We’re much more likely
to reject the facts to preserve our belief.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.520
Hence the Jesuits’ confident assertion.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.200
Indoctrination installs an ideology in the
child’s brain

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.040
with muscular connections to major areas of its life,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:16.520
including its sense of identity at every level
—&nbsp;self, family, community, for some nationality.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.640
The child will then automatically defend this ideology against any conflicting ideas,

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.480
without even knowing why.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.240
In fact, indoctrination conditions the child
with a gamut of reflex responses.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.520
Automatic, knee-jerk emotions, attitudes
and behaviours that aren’t even consciously processed.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:42.780
Responses like automatic compliance, denial,
anxiety, guilt, fear, judgements about other groups.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.320
An indoctrinated child is no more ‘free to think’

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.640
than a child whose parents have convinced it there are invisible monsters waiting for it outside the house

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.740
is free to walk out the front door.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.960
Some of us do manage to break the psychological hold of the ideologies thrust on us in childhood

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.960
often because some conflicting idea has managed to work its way through our defences

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.720
and, like a pebble in a shoe,
we can’t quite shake it loose.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.080
When we look to our ideology for answers,
we start noticing flaws we never spotted before.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.020
They begin to multiply.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.440
Before we know it, the ideology is cracking apart.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.680
Then flying apart.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.400
In regard to my own experience of this, I’ve often said
it was like throwing a rock through a spider’s web.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.120
The foundations of reality were ripped apart

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.500
leaving me in a state of limbo.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.320
It can take time to recover
from such all-encompassing disillusionment.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.660
But, when eventually we feel ready to face the task
of rebuilding our world piece by piece

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.700
there are consolations.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.340
We get the chance to lay better foundations

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.400
replacing dogmatic certainty,
mindless compliance and emotional thinking

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.540
with honest doubt,
mindful resistance and critical thinking.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.500
Some of us will even get to see our own children
grow up unshackled by indoctrination

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.060
leaving them genuinely free to think.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.780
When assessing whether an activity is abusive or not

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.340
it’s sometimes difficult to get outside
our habitual ways of thinking.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.940
Sometimes an abuse has become so normalised

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.500
that even if part of us understands intellectually
the injustice of what’s being described,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.400
somehow we just can’t get worked up about it.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.600
Certain thought experiments can sometimes
give us an insight into our rationalisations

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.170
even if only a brief glimpse.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:38.700
One of them is the veil of ignorance, proposed by
moral and political philosopher John Rawls.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.580
He suggested a hypothetical scenario
where we exist outside of a society

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.880
and have to decide what kinds of
governing principles we’d be prepared to accept.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.780
These might focus on divisions of labour,
allocation of resources, the granting of rights.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.540
The catch is that we don’t know what attributes
we’ll have when we enter that society

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:04.700
— what sex, skin colour, nationality,
natural abilities, inherited wealth, and so on.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.100
They’re hidden behind the veil of ignorance.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.780
What this does is remove our self-interest.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.940
Any personal meaning we might’ve attached
to these features is stripped away.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:19.860
Rawls suggested that a just society was one
that we’d be prepared to enter at random.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.180
So. I invite the viewer to imagine
the following two societies.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.660
Society A and society B each contain
the same range of religions.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:35.360
There are sikhs, hindus, buddhists, wiccans, 
christians, jews, muslims, and so on.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.140
There are the same denominations we see
in our world today, from moderate to fundamentalist.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:46.200
‘Christian’ could mean Amish, Mormons,
Jehovah’s Witnesses and so on.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.060
Society A runs on childhood indoctrination.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.990
Here, children are considered members
of their parents’ religion at birth.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.730
They’re taught to accept this religion as the truth

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:02.370
which in the overwhelming majority of cases
will result in their lifelong allegiance.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:06.160
Meanwhile, society B runs on childhood education.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.960
Here, children are informed about all religions
without preference or manipulation

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.940
and left to decide which — if any — they wish to join.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:24.500
In which of these two societies would you
be more comfortable being randomly born
to parents of any religious group?

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.360
The veil of ignorance removes self-interest.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.380
It actually does so simply by reminding us
how every single one of us came into this world.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.300
We didn’t choose characteristics
like our sex, skin colour, nationality.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.700
Something else we didn’t choose was our religion.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.840
But unlike the characteristics I’ve just mentioned,
we should’ve had control of this one.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.520
But that control gets taken away from us when
we’re assigned the religion of our parents at birth

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.560
and taught to accept its ideology as truth.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.680
We then develop a deep familiarity,
connection and loyalty to that religion.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.880
And we forget how utterly arbitrary it was that
we happened to be born to parents of this religion.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.560
We may even think how lucky we were
to be born to parents of the true religion

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.000
and not to parents of any of those
other false religions.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.920
Child indoctrination is an act of subjugation

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.240
colonising a human brain
in its most impressionable state

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.240
with an ideology it’s simply not equipped to process.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:26.100
An ideology that’ll extend a far reach over the child’s life — even down to choice of life partner.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.360
signing up to such ideologies
needs to be a matter of informed consent

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:36.680
not power-based child coercion that
bypasses consent, generation after generation.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.640
We wouldn’t abide it in politics.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.020
We shouldn’t abide it in religion.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:46.480
We need to put an end
to this inexcusable practice of grooming minds
