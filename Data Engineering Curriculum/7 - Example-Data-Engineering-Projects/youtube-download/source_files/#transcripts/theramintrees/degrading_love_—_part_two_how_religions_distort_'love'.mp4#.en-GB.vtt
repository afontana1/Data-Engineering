00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.930
This is the second of a two-part response
specifically for folks who approach me

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.930
with promises of their god’s love, setting out
my reasons for rejecting this apparent gift

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.270
and explaining why all of us deserve better.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.840
In part one, I looked at how
the major world religions encourage us

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.900
to view completely arbitrary life events and
physical sensations as evidence of divine love.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.680
And I highlighted some of the problems
this false love generates.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.800
I also looked at the parasitic nature of god
characters such as Yahweh and Allah

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.580
who're presented as loving parents, but who in fact
give absolutely no love to their supposed children

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.440
and instead constantly demand it.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.720
In part two, I want to expose more of the layers of depravity underpinning this parody of love.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.520
The major world religions are deeply
invested in the notion of free will.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.480
If we determine our own beliefs and actions,
we can reasonably be held accountable for them.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.840
On the platform of accountability, 
religions plant their concepts of sin and virtue

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.140
blaming us for the former and praising us for the latter.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.780
And on this stack of building blocks rest
the ultimate concepts of hell and heaven.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.440
Mess around with the notion of free will
and accusations of heresy soon start to fly.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.080
Within Christianity, emerging in the mid-1600s,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.260
the Jansenists held that humans
were powerless to avoid sinning

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.480
because, following Adam and Eve’s fall
from paradise, humans were deprived of grace.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.800
They further argued that any humans who were subsequently offered Yahweh’s grace

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.820
were powerless to resist it.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.000
This meant humans that humans
couldn't be held accountable

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.580
either for their sinful nature or their redemption.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.800
The Jansenists’ ideas soon aroused
papal condemnation for heresy.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.040
Within Islam, two groups emerged during the
Umayyad period, between the 7th and 8th centuries,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.780
that were both denounced because of their
contentious views on free will.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.260
The school of Jabariyyah viewed humans as
divine puppets whose actions were determined

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.980
by the Islamic god Allah and who
consequently bore no responsibility.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.600
To back up their assertion, they
cited surah 76 verse 30 of the Qur’an

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.200
which states that Allah’s will dictates human will.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.160
In contrast, the school of Qadariyyah

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.580
proposed that humans possessed a free will
completely independent of the will of Allah,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.320
making humans a rival to Allah.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.000
Senior lecturer in Islamic studies
Abdur Rashid Bhat writes that ....

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.320
‘Both these groups were disapproved of
by the Muslim community

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.220
for their rigid, extremist and heretical stands.’

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.200
All this bitter religious dispute to preserve
our freedom to determine our own life’s course.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.820
And what do the gods expect us to do
with this generous gift of freedom?

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.580
Submit ourselves into slavery.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.780
Islam is pretty upfront about its desire to enslave.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.800
The word ‘Islam’ itself means submission
—&nbsp;specifically submission to the will of Allah.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.120
Read scriptural and scholarly Islamic writings

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.449
—&nbsp;or simply talk to a range of Muslims —

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:31.109
and you’ll find the word ‘human’ openly
and unapologetically replaced

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.560
by the words ‘servant’ and ‘slave’.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.420
You’ll find similar language in the Bible.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.260
So — the gods gave us free will
so that we could choose to be slaves.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.620
Anyone spot the fundamental problem with this deal?

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.340
And there’s no room for
half-hearted or grudging submission.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.780
You have to really want to
put on those mental shackles —

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.240
to forgo your critical thinking
in order to defend the master’s stories;

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.220
to limit your human relationships
in order to defend the master’s supremacy;

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.720
to abandon your logical faculties
in order to defend the master’s inconsistencies;

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.780
to waive your moral reasoning
in order to defend the master’s immorality;

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.240
in short, to surrender your humanity
in order to defend your master’s inhumanity.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.560
And if your hunger for this
degradation isn’t strong enough?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.080
You’ll be condemned to everlasting suffering in hell.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.080
So, Yahweh and Allah —&nbsp;supposedly
the most loving beings to exist —

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.540
created us for slavery or torture.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.160
Even the Bible states that love and fear don’t mix.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.380
1 John 4:18 asserts ‘There is no fear in love.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.380
But perfect love drives out fear,
because fear has to do with punishment.’

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.660
Unfortunately, Yahweh seems
determined to have it both ways.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.440
In Matthew 22, Jesus states the greatest commandment
is to love Yahweh with all our heart and soul and mind.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.980
But in books such as Deuteronomy,
humans are repeatedly commanded to fear Yahweh.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.000
So we have an impossible triangle.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.620
Humans are first commanded to love Yahweh;
second, commanded to fear Yahweh;

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.260
and third, told that love and fear don’t mix.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.580
These contradictory angles add up to one big mess.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.640
Turning to Islam, threats
of hellish punishment for non-belief

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.520
contravene surah 2, verse 256 of the Qur’an,
which forbids compulsion in religion.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.720
What greater form of compulsion is there than
the threat of eternal torture?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.760
Of course, with Islam,
threats aren’t confined to the afterlife.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.440
It’s a modern-day disgrace
that over 20 territories on this planet

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.660
have official laws and policies
prohibiting deconversion from Islam.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.240
Apostates are threatened variously
with fines, loss of citizenship or execution.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.000
Several ex-Muslims living in these territories
have shared their personal stories with me,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.600
describing the exhausting,
corrosive psychological pressures

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.400
they’re forced to endure on a daily basis just to survive.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.440
So much for no compulsion.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.680
Of course, compulsion in religion isn’t just a problem
because some passage in the Qur’an forbids it.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.520
Compulsion backfires on Islam — and Christianity —
by destroying their very foundation: free will.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.540
The types of free will typically asserted by religions

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.820
are already difficult enough
to support on philosophical grounds

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.400
as our increasing understanding of the human brain

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.660
exposes increasing complexities and obstacles regarding the concept of choice.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.780
But the use of compulsion in religion,
forcing humans into submission,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.260
destroys any claim of divinely granted free will.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.520
This has a devastating knock-on effect

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.700
destroying accountability, virtue and ultimately
any justification for heavenly rewards.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.060
With their threats of eternal suffering

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.380
the gods huff and puff and blow their own house down.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.760
Divine attacks on free will can be found in
other parts of the Qur’an and Bible.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.400
In the Qur’an surah 2, verse 7, Allah is said to have
fixed a seal on the hearts and hearing of disbelievers

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.320
and veiled their vision.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.700
So disbelievers are divinely
prevented from becoming believers

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.880
and then punished for not believing.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.960
In the Bible, we find a similarly perverse
attack on free will in the book of Exodus.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.740
In chapter 3, verses 7 and 8, Yahweh tells Moses
he’s seen the oppression of the children of Israel

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.080
and promises to deliver them
from their Egyptian masters.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.200
In verses 19 and 20, Yahweh says he’s sure
the Egyptian Pharaoh will not liberate the Israelites.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.620
So Yahweh vows to strike Egypt with wonders,
after which he predicts the Pharaoh will let them go.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.580
But in Exodus 4, we find a bizarre plot twist.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.220
Yahweh tells Moses that he’s going
to harden the Pharaoh’s heart,

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.080
forcing the Pharaoh not to liberate the Israelites.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.660
So Yahweh promises to liberate the Israelites

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.080
then deliberately prevents their liberation
by taking away the Pharaoh’s free will.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.660
We now see why in Exodus 3 Yahweh was so sure
that the Pharaoh wouldn’t let the Israelites go.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:22.600
What this self-defeating divine intervention
means is that Yahweh’s strike against Egypt,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.940
supposedly in response to the Pharaoh’s refusal,
is in fact a response to Yahweh’s own actions.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.240
Given the choice, would you freely choose to be a slave?

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.020
Not only do Allah and Yahweh
want us to submit to slavery

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.240
they threaten us to submit with
promises of unimaginable punishment,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.460
and when it suits them,
they’re even prepared to force submission

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.240
by removing our free will altogether
— as Yahweh did with the Pharaoh

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.160
and then punish us for the consequences.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.460
This conflicted divine behaviour
demonstrates many character traits.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.620
Narcissism. Hypocrisy. Sadism.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.500
Conspicuously absent is love.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.220
Stretching back thousands of years

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.500
the practice of blood sacrifice to the gods
persists to this day on a huge scale.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.640
The rationale for these sacrifices varies.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.100
The world’s largest mass animal sacrifice
is performed by Muslims as part of Hajj

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.600
a vast annual pilgrimage to Mecca in which hundreds of thousands of animals

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.940
— including sheep, goats and cows — are slaughtered

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:42.120
‘in the hope of attaining closeness to Allah’, showing that ‘they are willing to give up some of their own benefits’.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.740
Within Hinduism, the Gadhimai festival has seen millions of devotees descend on Nepal every five years

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.460
for the world’s second largest animal sacrifice

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.400
in which — among other animals —
thousands of cattle are beheaded.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.960
Attendants hope that this torrent
of blood will make their wishes come true.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.900
Aside from the granting of wishes,
and displays of self-denial,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.140
another religious rationale for sacrifice
is substitutionary atonement.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.920
Here, people hope to erase their sins

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.500
by casting them onto a sacrificial subject
who’s punished in their place.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.640
An example of scapegoat sacrifice forms the
basis of Christianity.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:27.580
This sacrifice is cited as a demonstration of Yahweh’s profound love. But it demonstrates no such thing.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.980
Some folks are surprised to learn that the
life of the Biblical messiah Jesus

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.520
not only ends but begins with blood sacrifice.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.120
When he’s born, his parents sacrifice two birds

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.440
in keeping with a divine law set out in Leviticus 12.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:49.400
Not the stuff of school nativities. But it sets
an appropriately bloody tone for what's to come.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.860
Calling himself the son of Yahweh, Jesus infuriates the Jewish authorities.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.680
He’s arrested and tried by the Sanhedrin
— a Jewish judicial assembly

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.740
and condemned to death by crucifixion.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.420
Although he foresees all of these events
long in advance, he allows them to happen

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.220
because, through his death, he’s destined
to pay a ransom for humankind.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.460
Since the fall from paradise, after the first humans 
— Adam and Eve — disobeyed Yahweh

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.080
by eating from the forbidden tree
of the knowledge of good and evil

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.800
every human subsequently born was born wrong;
born as an imperfect sinner.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.420
The sins of every sinner had to be
paid for to avoid damnation

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.840
and for many years, animal sacrifices
were offered as payment.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.020
But then Jesus arrives and offers a deal.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.700
If we ask for his forgiveness, he’ll pay
with his blood, absolving us of our sins.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:50.740
Jesus’s blood is far more precious than
animal or human blood. It has infinite value.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.040
So it can absolve infinite sin.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.760
As a very young child I didn’t
understand this blood magic stuff

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.000
but I found the crucifixion story very distressing.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.680
As I grew up and my involvement
in Christianity deepened

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.300
I’d meditate repeatedly on Jesus’s sacrifice.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:13.540
Time after time, l’d imagine him dying in
agony to pay for my sins

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.760
and I’d cycle through the same overwhelming feelings.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:26.740
Sorrow, contrition, reverence,
incomprehension, powerlessness, thankfulness.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:32.760
It was an emotional mouse wheel
that flung rationality away with centrifugal force.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.680
But in my early teens, in a crisis of faith

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.460
I stepped off that mouse wheel for a moment
and examined this bloody drama with cold eyes.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.460
And I realised this drama was a farce.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.420
Why should we be blamed for being born sinners?

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.580
Why should we pay for some deficiency over
which we had absolutely no control?

00:12:53.580 --> 00:13:00.200
The fact was, in Biblical terms, the blood-hungry
Yahweh was entirely to blame for our sinful nature.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:07.600
When he created Adam, he created him from dust;
from earth. So Adam inherited no human sin.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.040
If Yahweh created every human this way
then no human would be an inherent sinner.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:21.200
But instead, quite bizarrely, having created Adam from
earth, Yahweh now switches to creation from birth

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.540
a completely different method which he knows
will guarantee that every human is an inherent sinner.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:33.740
By commanding Adam and Eve to go forth and multiply,
Yahweh deliberately multiplies human sin,

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.680
multiplies human debt, and multiplies
the need for blood sacrifice.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.520
We have names for people who
deliberately peddle inferior products

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.720
that demand constant, expensive maintenance work.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.020
‘Supreme intelligence’ isn’t one of them.

00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:57.040
John 3:16 tells us that Yahweh loved the world
so much that he sacrificed his one and only son.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.680
Far from showing love, Jesus’s death
is just the melodramatic hook

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.760
to one of the biggest religious scams in history

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.960
designed to arouse a combination
of profound guilt and gratitude,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.460
when we have absolutely no reason
to feel either of these.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.820
Not only is this blood-magic completely unnecessary,

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.900
it makes a mockery of personal responsibility.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:25.740
If people do me wrong, but then apologise and
make personal restoration, and I forgive them

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.800
the matter should be considered resolved.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.880
Not so, according to Yahweh.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.620
In fact, these wrongdoers could compensate me
a hundred times over; a thousand times over.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.980
Makes no odds.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:45.200
If they decline to participate in Yahweh’s blood magic
by submitting to Jesus, they’ll be condemned.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.500
Conversely, If people do me wrong,
but offer me no apology or restoration

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.960
and receive no forgiveness from me,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.560
the matter should be considered unresolved.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.480
Again, not so.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.420
If they use Yahweh’s blood magic, then they’re absolved.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.580
I have decades of experience of countless
Christians from various denominations

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:13.640
who’ve treated people appallingly — repeatedly stirring conflict, lying, bullying, falsely maligning others.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.940
And never making amends for their misdeeds.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:23.280
And yet they go to church each week, recite the Lord’s prayer — maybe confess their sins to a priest

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.420
and they’re assured that they’re forgiven.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.060
Substitutionary atonement destroys personal
accountability.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.400
The wrongs we do each other
are not magically wiped away

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.480
by grovelling to the ghost of some Jew
executed thousands of years ago.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.560
The wrongs we do each other
are resolved through human efforts

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:49.320
with remorse, integrity, patience, empathy.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.340
It can be a messy, uncertain, demanding process.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.160
But, unlike scapegoat sacrifice, it’s an honest one.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.640
And it gives us back what religions
like Christianity try to take from us —

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.780
the adult autonomy to sort out
our own problems and move on from them

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.800
— instead of submitting to a divine protection racket

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:15.760
in which we endlessly pay Yahweh
in blood to protect us from Yahweh.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.560
Religions like Christianity are divisive to the core.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.560
Even if there was only one denomination of Christianity
which everyone followed faithfully,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.660
the religion itself would still work to come
between its followers at all times.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.520
In the first of these two videos

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.600
I looked at Jesus’s demand that
we all love him more than anyone else.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.440
Nothing gentle, meek or mild about that.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.280
And not content with this already overinflated demand

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.760
in Luke 14, verse 26, Jesus really
lays bare the reach of his narcissism.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:01.300
He demands so much love that — by contrast —
our love for everyone else should feel like hate.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:07.220
Unfortunately, some Christians are willing to
downgrade their loved ones much more than this.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.240
Of the promises of divine love
made to me over the years

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.720
a significant percentage has come
from representatives of an organisation

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:21.020
that I regard as one of the least qualified
to talk about love: Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:26.640
The concept of separation is deeply embedded in the psychology of the JW organisation

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:33.320
which claims that the world has been taken over by
Satan, and that all non-Witnesses are morally corrupt.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.420
While you might find JWs interacting
with non-members on a superficial level,

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.240
including acts of kindness and charity,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.340
their desire to remain ‘separate from the
world’ puts a strict limit on these interactions

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.960
and creates an ‘us vs them’ mentality
which allows no middle ground.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.900
If individuals decide to leave the religion,
in line with the organisation’s policy

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:02.900
the entire JW community, including friends and family,
is compelled to dissociate itself from them

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.640
refusing even to acknowledge them with greetings.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.840
The organisation justifies this social shunning
with Biblical passages

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.440
such as 2 John, Matthew 18 and Romans 16

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.860
each of which discourages contact
with those who don’t follow the party line.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.640
JW literature presents shunning as ‘loving discipline’

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.640
designed to make individuals see the error
of their ways and return to the 'truth'.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.340
But comments made by the organisation
in its Watchtower magazine

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.460
give a different rationale for shunning

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.920
asserting that, ‘apostates are ‘mentally diseased,’

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.540
and they seek to infect others
with their disloyal teachings.’

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:49.720
The fact is this shunning is nothing more
than a cruel abuse of social power.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:55.680
Humans are social creatures. As such, we can be extremely vulnerable to social pressure.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.620
The JW organisation exploits this
vulnerability to gain compliance.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.420
Because they’re discouraged from forming
close friendships with non-members

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.800
shunned apostates are often stripped
of their entire social world.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.600
Of course there might be an overwhelming
urge to return to the flock.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.860
Not because the flock represents truth

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.720
but because of the pain of losing everything
and trying to surviving on their own.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.060
Returning to compliance takes the pain away.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.520
The isolationist mentality of this organisation shields its members from reality.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.620
By remaining separate from the world

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:36.420
JWs don’t get to see the lives of the ordinary folks
their organisation routinely condemns.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.900
Their fantasy of a world overrun
by Satan is never challenged.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.900
Yes, the world has problems.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.740
Yes, there are destructive agents operating in it.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:51.560
But there are also deeply dedicated humanitarian
agents working to improve the world.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.940
By extension, JWs never get to see of lives
of the family and friends they shun.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.860
If they did, many of them would have
to face an uncomfortable truth —

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:08.180
that the loved one they’ve shunned is leading a life
that’s just as good and honest and loving as it ever was.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.080
Let’s underscore this point.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.540
Wanda is a Jehovah’s Witness. Lois isn’t.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.120
For forty years, they lead virtually identical lives.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.200
Both make exactly the same mistakes
and do their best to make up for them.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.540
Both give exactly the same time and energy to charity.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.040
Both give exactly the same love to their families.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.700
The only difference is that, as a Jehovah’s Witness

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.480
Wanda asks Jesus to take responsibility for her wrongdoings with his blood

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.640
while Lois accepts responsibility for her own actions.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:46.220
In what way would Wanda be corrupted
by associating with Lois?

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:53.580
Does Lois’s decision to take responsibility for her own actions make her more or less virtuous than Wanda

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.400
who wants someone else to pay for hers?

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.800
Now let’s imagine that the children of both
women reveal that they’ve become a buddhist.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.580
Wanda shuns her child, who will now grow up to marry

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.720
and have children and grandchildren
who Wanda will never know.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.140
Lois holds onto her child,
doesn’t become a buddhist

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:19.480
but does enjoy years of mutually
rewarding relationships with her son, his wife

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.460
their children and their grandchildren.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.540
Bearing in mind the JWs’ complaint about
the destructive forces overrunning the world

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.760
which of these mothers has contributed more love to the world?

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.060
Religions that break up friends and families
have nothing to teach me about love.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.540
In part one, I mentioned that when I reject their promise of divine love

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:55.620
some folks assert that I’ve been somehow ‘damaged’,
and express hopes that I might someday be ‘healed’.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:01.320
If I was at all damaged then it was by
the warped, avaricious, sadistic pseudo-love

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.000
peddled by the religion into which I was indoctrinated.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.340
If I had to heal from anything, it was this.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.880
I had to unlearn the neurotic
thinking style instilled in me —

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.120
the habitual thoughts of unworthiness

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.400
the constant doubt about whether my love was ever good enough

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.860
the feeling that my life was not my own

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.440
the instinctive lack of confidence
in my own moral judgement.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.560
It’s no coincidence that religions
that pontificate endlessly about love

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.280
constantly neglect one of its
most important forms: self love.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.240
It’s the subject of corny songs
and cheesy internet memes.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.120
But for me, self love really
forms the grounding of all love.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.880
Self love isn’t about being proud or immodest.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.920
It isn’t about deluding ourselves that we have some special importance.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.940
It’s about being secure in our self-worth.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.340
When we don’t have an abiding
internal sense of our own worth

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.860
we often end up seeking validation from external agents.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.420
By giving them the power to control our sense of worth,

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.520
we become vulnerable to manipulation by those agents.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.480
Religious agents in particular are all too happy
to prey in that vulnerability.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.460
I was raised on a distorted parody of love.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.240
I didn’t see it was distorted, because everything
else in my life was distorted around it

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.100
to make it look reasonable.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.880
For years, I found ways of ignoring the telltale signs —

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:33.080
the subjugation, the suffering,
the needless overblown sacrifices

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.380
all of which were silently screaming at me:
‘You’re looking at this from the wrong angle’.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.100
But eventually I listened.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.220
The flip in perspective was disorientating.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.440
But things finally made sense.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.080
And I was able to shed years of
distorted thoughts and emotions.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:57.500
I was finally able to solve previously insoluble problems thrown up by these loveless ideologies

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:03.700
like: ‘How do you find a moment’s happiness in heaven
when you’re conscious of loved ones burning in hell?’

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.240
The answer was simple: ‘You don’t.’

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:13.500
Many of us come from generations of folks
who’ve had this corrupt model of love drilled into them.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.220
But things are changing.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:20.300
And I know I’m not alone when I say:
I reject this degrading ‘love’.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:36.080
[a succession of voices affirming:
I reject this degrading ‘love’.]
