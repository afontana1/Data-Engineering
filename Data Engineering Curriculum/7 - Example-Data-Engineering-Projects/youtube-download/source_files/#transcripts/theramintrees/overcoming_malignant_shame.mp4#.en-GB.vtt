00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.800
In my therapy work with abused individuals

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.720
there was always huge variation

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.440
in the emotions experienced by different clients.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.080
Some felt explosive rage.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.240
For others, anger was nonexistent.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.880
Some clients looked back on their abusive&nbsp;
relationships with overwhelming grief.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.080
Others viewed them with cold detachment.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.720
But one emotion was present in&nbsp;
some form in virtually every case.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.720
Common as it was, the nature of the emotion itself

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.360
made it one of the most difficult to discuss.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.240
And some individuals worked&nbsp;
hard to avoid the subject.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.700
Shame.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.840
I want to explore some questions&nbsp;
about this potent emotion.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.640
What are the effects of shame?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.040
What kinds of environments encourage shame?

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.280
Is the practice of shaming&nbsp;
individuals a force for social good?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.320
How do shame-bound individuals&nbsp;— who’ve&nbsp;
become immersed in malignant shame —

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.080
overcome their self-loathing?

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.040
Shame is broadly defined&nbsp;
as an uncomfortable feeling

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.760
caused by an awareness of&nbsp;
some personal shortcoming.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.400
On the surface, it would seem&nbsp;
like a useful, healthy emotion

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.800
conducive to positive social interactions.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.040
After all, feeling some discomfort&nbsp;
about our transgressions

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800
can motivate us to do better.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.880
So what’s the problem?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.480
To understand the special impact of shame

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.760
it can be instructive to look&nbsp;
at a closely related emotion.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.160
June Tangney and Jessica Tracy&nbsp;
explored the relationship

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.000
between shame and guilt

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.440
two members of a group of self-conscious emotions

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.080
that also includes pride and embarrassment.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.040
They note that shame and guilt&nbsp;
are frequently mentioned together

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.880
and characterised as moral&nbsp;
emotions that inhibit behaviour

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.840
considered to be antisocial&nbsp;
or morally objectionable.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.680
In reality, things aren’t so straightforward.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.160
Shame and guilt have some fundamental differences

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.320
that generate very different motivations.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.600
For Tangney and Tracy, it was psychologist

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.160
Helen Block Lewis who captured the distinction.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.240
According to Lewis, guilt&nbsp;
involves a negative evaluation

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.640
of a specific act or behaviour

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.920
whereas shame goes deeper, involving&nbsp;
a negative evaluation of the self.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.880
The person is seen as having a defective,&nbsp;
inadequate, even corrupt nature.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.760
This difference in focus has&nbsp;
a big impact on our responses.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.840
Tangney and colleagues present&nbsp;
a wealth of empirical research

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.520
showing how targeting the&nbsp;
person rather than the act

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.160
is associated with a range of destructive&nbsp;
behaviours and mental health issues.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.400
Susceptibility to shame is strongly&nbsp;
related to defensive anger and aggression.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.760
The aggression could be physical or verbal.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.840
It might be displaced —&nbsp;
directed towards individuals

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.680
unrelated to the source of the shame.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.480
Anger is also often directed inward on the self

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.080
further compounding the problem.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.520
In contrast, susceptibility to guilt&nbsp;
appears to be unrelated to anger.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.880
Where guilt-prone individuals do feel anger

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.000
they’ve been found more likely&nbsp;
to handle it constructively

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.040
with non-hostile discussion and corrective action.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.320
Shame-prone individuals are more likely

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.720
to try and deny or evade the situation

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.840
whereas guilt-prone individuals are more likely

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.080
to engage in restorative behaviour

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.440
including confessions, apologies and reparations.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.680
Jeff Joireman found that shame was&nbsp;
associated with unproductive self-rumination.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.520
Shame-prone individuals can become absorbed

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.960
in unfocussed self-critical thoughts,&nbsp;
resulting in more psychological distress

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.920
and less headspace for empathic reflection.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.080
Joireman suggested that shame and rumination

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.680
feed on each other, creating&nbsp;
a self-reinforcing cycle.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.480
Given all the distortions associated with shame

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.800
it’ll come as no surprise that&nbsp;
susceptibility to shame is strongly linked

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.840
to a range of psychological symptoms and disorders

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.600
including depression, anxiety,&nbsp;
PTSD, eating disorders,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.760
substance abuse, self-harming&nbsp;
and suicidal behaviour.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.560
The evidence is clear.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.600
With its focus on a specific act

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.360
guilt serves various&nbsp;
psychologically adaptive functions

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.760
helping to facilitate positive resolution.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.320
Meanwhile, with its focus&nbsp;
widened to the whole person

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.280
shame serves various maladaptive functions

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.120
sparking aggressive defences&nbsp;
that block positive resolution

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.440
and lead to destruction and disorder.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.640
Targets of abuse often have&nbsp;
a susceptibility to shame

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.000
actively instilled into&nbsp;
them in their earliest years

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.240
through constant subjection to shaming.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.320
This can develop into toxic or malignant shame

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.680
where the shame becomes a&nbsp;
more or less perpetual state

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.200
permeating the target’s thoughts,&nbsp;
actions and experiences.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.840
For the shame-bound individual

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.920
the process of overcoming abuse&nbsp;
can feel like an assault course

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.840
because even the steps they take&nbsp;
towards health can inspire shame.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.200
Of the many kinds of manipulations&nbsp;
abusers use on their targets

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.760
— from gaslighting to&nbsp;
infantilising to double binds —

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.920
shaming is one of the most pernicious.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.560
Different abusers will inject different&nbsp;
strains of shame into their targets

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.560
based on their own hang-ups.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.960
Some abusers are obsessed with&nbsp;
germs and dirt, neatness and order.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.520
Some are preoccupied with body image,&nbsp;
sexuality, gender roles, social status.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.000
But in all cases the&nbsp;
underlying message is the same:

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.160
there’s something fundamentally wrong with you.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.840
Some abusers convey this message directly

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.080
openly telling targets they’re&nbsp;
worthless, rotten, degraded.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.760
Many abusive religious&nbsp;
groups plump for this option

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.640
teaching targets to grovel to gods and ghosts

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.480
to forgive them for their wretchedness.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.680
A more indirect method is to&nbsp;
set impossibly high standards.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.760
Targets are often expected to&nbsp;
exhibit superhuman qualities

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.280
like infallibility, omniscience, telepathy.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.360
They’re expected to know exactly what&nbsp;
to do and say at any given moment

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.000
and punished when they inevitably fall short.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.440
In healthy environments, it’s understood

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.400
that each of us is born fumbling and unprepared

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.640
into a strange and bewildering world.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.160
Mistakes are expected as a natural part

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160
of learning to navigate that world

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.840
and seen as a source of growth.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.960
Malignant shaming environments make&nbsp;
few allowances for inexperience.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.440
Mistakes are taken as proof of innate stupidity,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.240
thoughtlessness, or deliberate troublemaking.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.160
Instead of growing, the target’s world shrinks.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.400
Over time, the abuser’s message is internalised

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.520
changing from ‘there’s something&nbsp;
fundamentally wrong with you’

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.640
into ‘there’s something&nbsp;
fundamentally wrong with me’.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.560
This is where shaming surpasses manipulations&nbsp;
like gaslighting and double binds.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.400
Shaming is an abuse we’re&nbsp;
taught to inflict on ourselves.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.880
Targets absorb the hypercritical&nbsp;
voices of their abusers

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.160
so that eventually the abusers&nbsp;
don’t have to say a word.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.680
The shame-bound individual is like a fox

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.960
that’s been trained to hunt itself to exhaustion

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.680
while the hounds sit back and enjoy the show.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.160
What’s more, the fox often&nbsp;
continues to hunt itself

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.600
long after the hounds have gone.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.680
Unlike gaslighting and double binds which stop

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.640
the moment we cut our abusers out of our lives

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.520
shame can persist long after&nbsp;
we’ve ditched our abusers.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.840
Even after their death.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.280
I want to look at five persistent sources of shame

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.440
commonly reported by targets of abuse.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.320
Many targets feel deeply ashamed&nbsp;
for allowing the abuse to happen.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.520
Even in cases where they were only children

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.960
facing adult abusers with&nbsp;
unfathomable power and resources.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.520
Even in cases where they acknowledge

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.320
that resistance might well’ve&nbsp;
led to more intense abuse.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.200
They still blame themselves for not resisting.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.120
In a similar vein, some targets feel ashamed

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.360
for having being part of a malignant group

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:11.600
—&nbsp;a family, a workplace, a religious sect —

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.000
in which they repeatedly witnessed the&nbsp;
abuse of others and took no action.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.440
Targets sometimes feel ashamed of times

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.840
when they’ve hidden from their abusers.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.880
Someone I’ll call Simon told me he would&nbsp;
secretly disconnect his family’s telephone

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.960
on certain nights of the week to avoid&nbsp;
phone calls from an abusive friend.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.840
He said he was afraid his cowardice&nbsp;
would be discovered by his family.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.040
Many targets feel ashamed of some&nbsp;
of the maladaptive coping techniques

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.880
they’ve used to try and temporarily&nbsp;
anaesthetise their self-loathing.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.840
Like bingeing on drugs, food&nbsp;
or alcohol; self-harming;

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.280
participating in risky sexual encounters

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.600
which sometimes go much further than planned.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.040
Because the coping technique&nbsp;
is in itself a source of shame

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.080
it can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.320
Shame provokes the coping technique

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.080
which in turn provokes more shame.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.080
I want to mention one more common source of shame.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.240
Some years ago when I was&nbsp;
working in a counselling charity

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.240
I saw a client I’ll call Troy who’d&nbsp;
written on his application form

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.920
that he’d recently been ambushed&nbsp;
at knife point by two muggers.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.960
On reading those details, I assumed&nbsp;
he’d come to deal with trauma.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.160
In fact he came to deal with shame.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.360
When the muggers jumped him from&nbsp;
behind, flashing a knife in his face

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.400
instinctively Troy found himself fighting back

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.440
— as he put it — like a cat on drugs.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.720
Within the space of a few seconds

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.240
one of his attackers was&nbsp;
immobilised with a broken leg

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.720
and the other was concussed into unconsciousness.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.440
The emergency services were called

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.760
and Troy’s attackers were&nbsp;
later arrested and charged.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.800
Despite assurances from ambulance and police staff

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.040
that he had no reason to reproach&nbsp;
himself for fending off his attackers

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.040
Troy became consumed with shame at&nbsp;
the injuries he inflicted on them.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.080
He replayed the event endlessly

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.520
beating himself up for not&nbsp;
exercising more self-control.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.280
One of the most twisted kinds of&nbsp;
shame instilled in targets of abuse

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.280
is the shame of sticking up for yourself.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.480
For some targets, overcoming&nbsp;
these five sources of shame

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.720
begins by acknowledging them for&nbsp;
what they are: survival behaviours.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
All of them are classic instinctive&nbsp;
responses to persistent threat.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.840
We shut down. We hide. We&nbsp;
numb ourselves. We lash out.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.360
How perverse is it that our&nbsp;
abusers throw us into survival mode

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.240
and we despise ourselves for trying to survive?

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.400
In one of my first counselling&nbsp;
qualification courses

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.280
one of the course leaders, a woman called Celia

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.920
conducted a counselling&nbsp;
session in front of the class

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.480
with a volunteer student I’ll call Harriot.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.960
Harriot spoke openly about her shame in tolerating

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.080
violent abuse from her family&nbsp;
throughout her childhood.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.960
She said she hated how weak she’d been.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.600
Celia commented, ‘I think that&nbsp;
little girl was incredibly strong.’

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.880
Harriot protested, ‘How can you say that?’

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.440
Celia said, ‘Because she made&nbsp;
it here to tell the tale.’

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.480
In the tears that followed, a&nbsp;
great deal of shame was released.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.880
People who make it out of abusive environments

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.760
sometimes kick themselves&nbsp;
for having tolerated things

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.680
they wouldn’t dream of tolerating now.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.560
But we can’t blame ourselves

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.200
for knowledge and skills we didn’t have back then.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.480
That’s the mindset of abusive shamers

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.880
who expect us to know exactly what&nbsp;
to do and say at any given moment.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.240
Overcoming shame means letting go&nbsp;
of those impossible expectations.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.080
I’m pleased to report that both the individuals

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.600
in the real-life cases I’ve&nbsp;
mentioned overcame their shame.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.920
Troy was able to lay the ultimate responsibility

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.440
for his attackers’ injuries&nbsp;
where it belonged —&nbsp;on them.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.680
They chose to jump a stranger in the street

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.680
and put him in fear for his life.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.320
By creating that volatile situation, they&nbsp;
put not only Troy but themselves at risk.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.720
Unfortunately for them, in&nbsp;
their case that risk backfired.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.520
Simon’s case in particular&nbsp;
illustrates an important point.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400
Eventually Simon ended the friendship.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.160
Sometime later he spoke to&nbsp;
his family about the abuse.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.240
When he confessed to&nbsp;
disconnecting the family phone

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.240
far from judging him to be a coward

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.800
his family just wished he’d told them sooner

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.120
so he wouldn’t’ve had to&nbsp;
struggle with it by himself.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.000
This highlights the&nbsp;
self-defeating nature of shame.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.200
Our fear of disapproval inhibits us from testing

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.600
whether our fear of disapproval is well-founded.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.360
Sometimes keeping shameful secrets&nbsp;
just insulates us from support.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.640
When we’ve been taught to&nbsp;
feel persistent private shame

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.560
— to see ourselves as defective, worthless —

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.760
overcoming that mindset&nbsp;
means retraining our brains

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.960
unpicking the malignant&nbsp;
thinking habits we’ve acquired.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.840
Part of that retraining process is learning

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.240
to recognise the alien saboteur —

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.040
the voice of our abusers that we’ve internalised

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.640
that masquerades as our own.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.200
Instead of giving that voice&nbsp;
our mindless reflex agreement

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.040
we can learn to view it with&nbsp;
mindful critical distance

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.920
and reject any bogus sentiments;

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.680
divorce ourselves from its alien&nbsp;
preoccupations and hang-ups.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.800
An idea internalised by many&nbsp;
targets to varying degrees

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.240
is that they bear responsibility&nbsp;
for everything bad that happens.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.480
Pawel had a particularly&nbsp;
powerful strain of this one.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.400
It was his girlfriend who&nbsp;
suggested he tried therapy.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.640
She said he was always so hard on himself

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.240
and she wondered if he was depressed.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.720
Pawel presented as a cheerful upbeat individual.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.960
He joked that it was probably his girlfriend&nbsp;
who needed therapy for putting up with him.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.800
I asked why his girlfriend might&nbsp;
think he was hard on himself.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.880
He said she hated how he beat&nbsp;
himself up when things went wrong.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.720
She was always trying to convince&nbsp;
him things weren’t his fault.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.640
But Pawel said he was ‘bad luck’.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.920
He joked that he had the ‘sadim’ touch

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.160
which my confused face prompted him to&nbsp;
explain was the Midas touch in reverse.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.720
In our sessions it became clear this self-image

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.880
had been drilled into him by his parents.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.640
From his earliest years, he&nbsp;
was subjected to complaints

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.200
about how much better their&nbsp;
lives would’ve been without him.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.560
He was blamed for their financial struggles,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.160
their feuds with relatives,&nbsp;
even their physical illnesses.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.480
Pawel internalised the idea&nbsp;
he was the source of all bad

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.440
and applied it to his relationships with&nbsp;
other people, including his girlfriend.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.320
He was an affliction, a Jonah.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.920
For all his joking, it was a crushing burden.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.120
But what was weighing Pawel down

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.160
had absolutely nothing to do with responsibility.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.440
Pawel and I spent some time reflecting&nbsp;
on the concept of responsibility

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.680
and how it applied in different situations.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.960
We started out with examples from his own life.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.600
But he found it difficult to be objective.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.320
His mind was powerfully geared to&nbsp;
hunt for reasons to blame himself

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.480
and disregard arguments in his defence.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.520
So we looked at various hypothetical&nbsp;
situations involving other people.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.920
For example, a random stranger with no training

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.640
is put in sole charge of a nuclear powerstation.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.840
If the plant goes into meltdown,&nbsp;
should she be held responsible?

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.600
A museum curator is ordered at&nbsp;
gunpoint to open the museum vault

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.600
and hand over a valuable painting.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.880
Should he be held responsible for the theft?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.200
In the process of articulating his responses

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.920
to these and other imaginary examples

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.680
Pawel began to dig deep into&nbsp;
the concept of responsibility.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.040
Over time, he identified a range&nbsp;
of factors that would affect

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.600
how an individual’s responsibility was assessed.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.400
Factors like knowledge, skill,&nbsp;
autonomy, intention, power.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.360
He recognised that where these&nbsp;
capacities were absent or diminished

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.320
responsibility could be reduced or nullified.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.200
When the time felt right, I put&nbsp;
the following situation to him:

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.560
A couple decide to have a child.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.640
They experience financial struggles, feuds&nbsp;
with relatives and physical illnesses.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.600
How responsible is the child?

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.040
Long pause. Then a laugh.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.160
Then a quiet declaration: ‘I wasn’t responsible.’

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.280
In subsequent sessions, Pawel&nbsp;
dissected many instances

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.840
of false blame heaped on him by his parents.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.920
He began to see the sheer&nbsp;
perversity of their behaviour.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.760
He recalled an old forgotten memory of a time

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.560
when his father was driving and took a wrong turn.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.680
When Pawel pointed out the mistake

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.360
he was scolded and dismissed.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.880
Later, when his father had to&nbsp;
concede he was lost, he blamed Pawel.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.920
If the boy had made himself useful&nbsp;
navigating the journey by map

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.920
instead of just sitting there staring&nbsp;
out the window they’d never’ve got lost.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.560
This is how it went.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.320
His parents would shut down his contributions

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.400
then blame him for not contributing.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.480
With little power comes little responsibility.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.320
Pavel’s case illustrates some useful points

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.040
about overcoming misguided private shame.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.520
As I’ve noted, the stimulus&nbsp;
that sparks private shame

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.360
will vary from person to person.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.760
In Pawel’s case, random&nbsp;
misfortunes triggered the feeling.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.080
But it could be anything from&nbsp;
experiencing sexual desire

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.240
to having critical thoughts about&nbsp;
a religious or political ideology

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.640
to feeling some forbidden emotion&nbsp;
— maybe&nbsp;anger or distress.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.400
These shame responses are&nbsp;
unexamined, automatic, thoughtless.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.400
A powerful antidote to an&nbsp;
unthinking response is thinking.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.680
The more conscious critical thought we apply

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.560
the less misguided shame we’re likely to feel.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.040
And Pawel’s case highlights the&nbsp;
importance of thinking for yourself.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.400
My role in his sessions was not&nbsp;
to do all the thinking for him

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.040
but to provide a socratic dialogue —

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.920
to offer questions to assist him in his thinking.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.320
In the building of his&nbsp;
thoughts about responsibility

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.160
Pawel did his own heavy lifting.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.480
Many shame-bound individuals struggle to&nbsp;
judge for themselves what’s reasonable.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.720
Is it okay to think this?

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.360
Is it okay to feel that?

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.720
In this state of doubt, there’s often a temptation

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.120
to defer to the judgements of others

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.000
to let others do the thinking for them.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400
The most face-smacking problem with this

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.640
is that deferring to the judgement of others

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.560
is often precisely what leads&nbsp;
individuals to become shame-bound.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.560
They’ve deferred to bogus misguided judgements.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.080
If we’re struggling to judge for ourselves

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.840
whether a thought, a feeling,&nbsp;
an action is acceptable

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.880
deferring to what other people find acceptable

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.280
will do nothing to enhance our judgement.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.360
To do that, we have to develop our own thinking

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.480
to become our own Socratic questioner

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.000
interrogating our principles,&nbsp;
exposing our assumptions

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.640
attacking our ideas from all&nbsp;
angles to see if they hold up.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.560
Then we can make our own confident&nbsp;
rational judgements about what’s acceptable

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.800
and let go of our private shame.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.680
And something else will happen.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.840
We’ll be equipped to stand&nbsp;
our ground against the group

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.080
— to resist public shaming.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.240
Our experiences of public&nbsp;
shame are intimately bound up

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.080
with some of our most primitive&nbsp;
instincts around social membership.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.240
When people are found to have gone&nbsp;
against the rules of their group

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.960
remarkably similar responses are seen

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.080
across human cultures around the world.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.360
Individuals withdraw and&nbsp;
attempt to appease the group.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.720
They communicate their&nbsp;
acceptance that their welfare

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.360
is now regarded by others as less important

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.360
and perform various nonverbal&nbsp;
displays of subordination

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.400
which resemble appeasement&nbsp;
gestures found in other primates.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.680
They also show higher levels of cooperation.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.720
The cross-cultural — and in some&nbsp;
cases cross-species — nature

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.120
of these responses points to a&nbsp;
deeply hardwired social mechanism.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.040
Whatever kind of group we find ourselves born into

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.680
whether it’s an enlightened free society

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.800
or a dogmatic ideological backwater

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.200
we absorb its values and fear being&nbsp;
discovered transgressing them.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.880
This is how the phenomenon of shame&nbsp;
feeds into the tyranny of the majority.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.520
In families, ideological communities, nations

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.880
individuals are trained to feel defective

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.880
based not on rightness or&nbsp;
rationality but merely on numbers

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.640
— on what the majority happens&nbsp;
to consider acceptable.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.440
The prospect of public shaming&nbsp;
for perceived transgressions

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.440
is what confronts people who ‘come out’

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.560
— people who reveal an aspect of themselves

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.280
that’s been unjustly&nbsp;
stigmatised within their group.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.400
Often these individuals have resolved&nbsp;
their feelings of private shame

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.840
acknowledging within themselves that&nbsp;
they have no reason to feel defective.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.520
And in the process of coming&nbsp;
out, they deal confidently

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.160
with attempts to humble them with public shame.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.840
But it’s worth mentioning that for some&nbsp;
individuals things don’t go to plan.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.560
In the midst of their declaration, they&nbsp;
find their previous confidence collapses.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.720
They watch themselves&nbsp;apologising, appeasing,

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.480
compromising and accepting inferior status.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.080
Later, they wonder what happened.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.680
It felt like they were taken over.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.640
And it’s possible they were —

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.880
by the aforementioned human instinct

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.520
to submit in the face of group disapproval.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.720
These hardwired social instincts&nbsp;
can have a powerful grip on us.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.840
But if we’re consciously prepared for them

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.840
we can often keep them under control.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.920
It’s especially easy for instinct to&nbsp;
take over when things get aggressive.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.880
And in some cases that instinct is a good thing.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.760
In recent years, some people who’ve&nbsp;
shared their coming out experiences

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.000
reported being physically attacked and&nbsp;
having dangerous objects thrown at them.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.880
By who? Their parents.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.600
Some tried to appease them.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.760
Some ran out of the house.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.000
Later on, some of them were&nbsp;
annoyed that they backed down.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.080
My response is I’m glad they&nbsp;
made it out in one piece.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.320
For me the pressing issue would be:

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.120
do people who provoke raw survival&nbsp;
instincts deserve any place in your life?

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.400
Sometimes public shaming can&nbsp;
take individuals by surprise.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.280
But even though they’re unprepared for it

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.680
it can really serve to clarify things for them.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.000
Some real-life cases.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:14.000
Ruth was born into a religious community&nbsp;
in which the women only wore dresses.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.600
In her twenties, tired of&nbsp;
this sartorial restriction

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.120
she started wearing trousers.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.920
She knew plenty of women outside of her community

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.520
who wore them and in her mind,&nbsp;
it hadn’t seemed a big deal.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.600
She was shocked to find herself&nbsp;
insulted and pathologised

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.720
by several members of her&nbsp;
family and the wider community.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.160
Throughout his childhood,&nbsp;
Virgil was violently molested.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.640
His abuser was an older cousin

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.520
who had an illness that&nbsp;
shortened his life expectancy.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.960
To the rest of the family, Virgil’s&nbsp;
abuser was an innocent tragic figure.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.560
And after his death in his early twenties

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.640
the family began to picture him as&nbsp;
a guardian angel watching over them.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.040
They would call out for his help

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.360
and thank him when good things happened.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.440
Eventually Virgil told his family&nbsp;
what their guardian angel did to him.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.720
His revelation was met with a&nbsp;
silence that persisted for days.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.480
When he pushed for some response

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.640
his mother said he’d ruined everything&nbsp;
and he should’ve kept it to himself.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.120
Some weeks later, some relatives suggested&nbsp;
the abuse was just innocent play.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.040
Some suggested Virgil initiated it.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.040
He realised they were slowly bringing&nbsp;
their guardian angel back to life.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.080
In her thirties, Jacqueline cut all contact&nbsp;
with her abusive parents and siblings

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.000
keeping in touch only with&nbsp;
members of the wider family.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.080
When a much-loved uncle died,&nbsp;
Jacqueline attended the funeral

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.000
taking a friend for moral support.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.760
Both of them experienced a barrage of insults&nbsp;
from Jacqueline’s parents and siblings

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.240
who told her she should be&nbsp;
ashamed to show her face.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.400
After the funeral, they continued their abuse

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.120
following Jacqueline and her&nbsp;
friend back to their hotel.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.800
Some months later, her mother died.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.320
Jacqueline didn’t attend the funeral.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.040
Through the wider family grapevine&nbsp;
she heard that her father complained

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.480
how shameful it was that&nbsp;
Jacqueline didn’t show her face.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.760
But, without Jacqueline’s presence

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.880
he seemed to lose steam and soon fizzled out.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.680
For Ruth, her community’s attempts to shame her

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.800
opened her eyes to how they&nbsp;
falsely moralised non-moral issues.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.800
She had always seen the practice&nbsp;
of wearing dresses as a tradition.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.120
But they elevated it to a moral law

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.120
which they tried to justify to her

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.720
with fallacious nonsense about gender and virtue.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.680
As Ruth noted, it’s the role of traditions&nbsp;
to serve the people who perform them

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.720
—&nbsp;not the role of people to serve traditions.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.360
And wearing dresses wasn’t serving her.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.440
The incident brought out a side&nbsp;
of her family and community

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.040
she hadn’t seen before and&nbsp;
began an unravelling process

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.960
that eventually led to her departure.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.960
Virgil came to realise his&nbsp;
family was more invested

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.920
in preserving illusions than in his welfare.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.680
For all their lip service&nbsp;
about the importance of family

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.320
— about its ‘unbreakable bonds’ —

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.760
not a single individual had shown any empathy

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.040
for the pain and shame he’d&nbsp;
carried for so many years.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.840
Instead they focused on&nbsp;
resuscitating their fantasy image

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.560
of his abuser as an innocent angel.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.000
In contrast to his family, Virgil&nbsp;
didn’t try to preserve his illusions.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.640
He realised how brittle his family was.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.520
They couldn’t deal with reality

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.840
and the emotional mess it sometimes brought.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.480
He recognised these weren’t people&nbsp;
he could look to for support.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.360
And he drifted into appropriately distant contact.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.040
For Jacqueline, it was no surprise&nbsp;
that her family criticised her

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.000
for showing her face then&nbsp;
for not showing her face.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.400
It was a perfect example of the no-win&nbsp;
double-bind abuse she endured growing up

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.840
where the rules could be reversed&nbsp;
at any time to put her in the wrong.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.800
But being attacked at her uncle’s funeral

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.760
what struck her for the first time was&nbsp;
how desperate for drama her family was.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.800
Before she’d cut them out of her life

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.320
they’d always been so careful&nbsp;
to abuse her in private

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.000
and maintain a happy family&nbsp;
image to the outside world.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.840
But the funeral was like a feeding frenzy.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.160
They were so hungry for blood they&nbsp;
forgot all about their public image.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.840
It was eye-opening.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.640
She realised how dependent they’d&nbsp;
been on her as a source of drama.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.640
It was eye-opening for many&nbsp;
members of the wider family too.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.360
Some of them reached out to Jacqueline

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.400
and her relationships with&nbsp;
them took on a whole new life.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.280
In families, in communities, in nations

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.920
it often takes incidents like these

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.520
—&nbsp;savage public displays of abusive shaming —

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.840
to wake people up to what’s going on.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.040
When we’re confronted with&nbsp;
public shaming from a group

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.080
it’s easy for us to merge&nbsp;
everyone together in our minds

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.560
— to see them as a faceless mob.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.920
I’ve been subjected to abusive&nbsp;
public shaming twice in my life

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.440
—&nbsp;both in my teenage years.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.880
The first time, like Ruth, Virgil and&nbsp;
Jacqueline, it took me by surprise.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.640
It was such a surreal, twilight zone experience

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.280
my overriding feeling was morbid fascination.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
The second time I was prepared.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.720
Both times, I found myself&nbsp;
quietly observing these people.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.560
I took a long cold hard look at each of them.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.840
While the behaviour of individuals who submit

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.040
to public shaming from their&nbsp;
group is extremely similar

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.000
behaviour from the actual group itself

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
often shows significant variation.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.440
Within my community, some individuals&nbsp;
attacked me with genuine rage;

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.040
others attacked me with sadistic pleasure

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.280
clearly taking amusement in my abuse.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.080
Some people ignored me with an&nbsp;
attitude of obvious contempt;

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.640
others ignored me with an&nbsp;
attitude of apologetic awkwardness

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.320
as if they just didn’t know what to say.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.920
Some individuals would appeal to me to repent;

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.440
others would quiz me for hours, trying to find out

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.840
what had happened to me to steer me off course

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.200
—&nbsp;and failing to listen to a single word I said.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.440
And in some cases, individuals would hop around

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.800
between different approaches

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.840
— threatening then guilt-tripping then pleading.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.560
The phrase ‘can’t see the forest for the trees’

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.480
refers to situations where people&nbsp;
are so focused on minor details

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.560
that they fail to see the bigger picture.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.920
But sometimes it helps to&nbsp;
stay focused on the trees

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.400
—&nbsp;to see the individuals instead of the group.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.480
There’s no wisdom of crowds&nbsp;
in abusive public shaming.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.240
Just a collection of confused, misguided

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.840
and, in some cases, sadistic individuals.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.800
When we’ve been trained to feel malignant shame

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.280
retraining our brains can take time.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.160
And it can help to find&nbsp;
good supportive communities

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.200
who reinforce healthy critical thinking habits.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.720
But it’s worth noting that sometimes

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.960
when we think we’ve overcome our shame

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.040
and feel able to stand our ground

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.080
it can start creeping back&nbsp;
in subtle insidious ways.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.320
Some people who’ve been historically shamed

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.040
by their family come to an uneasy truce.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.760
Not wanting to lose the person

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.520
family members makes a&nbsp;
superficial show of acceptance

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.400
—&nbsp;but continue to communicate their discomfort

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.960
and disapproval in indirect ways.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.080
The unspoken bargain is:

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.760
‘We’ll tolerate you if you don’t&nbsp;
talk about that part of you....’

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.920
It’s a kind of shaming by stealth.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.080
For people who’ve struggled with shame

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.880
it‘s wise to think about&nbsp;
limiting the time you spend

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.480
around people who constantly&nbsp;
work to re-energise the idea

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.880
that there’s something&nbsp;
fundamentally wrong with you.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.480
Wherever you are in your journey

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.960
—&nbsp;taking your first steps or&nbsp;
a fair way along the road —

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:51.840
I wish you success in overcoming malignant shame.
