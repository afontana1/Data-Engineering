00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.540
In the first video
I looked at the illusions

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.008
we construct to deny death

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:08.967
and how they lead

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.839
to divisive and disproportionate
emotional responses to folks

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.441
who don't share those illusions.

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:14.579
In this second video,

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.767
I'll be exploring several
other grave subjects,

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:19.436
including the label of
'pro-mortality atheist',

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.862
the demands of immortality,

00:00:20.862 --> 00:00:23.172
the claim that there are
no atheists in foxholes,

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:26.404
and the possibility of peace of mind
without recourse to illusion.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.978
Clearly, inventing illusions to deny death

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:33.601
hasn't brought the peace of mind
we might've hoped for.

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.803
Our poorly-constructed
fantasies of immortality

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:40.570
unable to withstand scrutiny or challenge
have inevitably created deep divisions

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.200
which remain despite
attempts to smooth over them

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.567
with a veneer of multiculturalism.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.819
A veneer that can swiftly dissolve
when death raises its bony head.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.366
So what about aiming
for literal immortality?

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:56.184
A few months ago QualiaSoup and I
were labelled 'pro-mortality atheists',

00:00:56.184 --> 00:00:58.748
because we pointed out
that while death brings endings

00:00:58.748 --> 00:01:01.152
for which we often feel
unprepared or ill-equipped,

00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:03.591
without it, there'd be
no space for new life.

00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.815
But this isn't a pro-mortality position.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:09.626
It's a practical recognition of the fact
that our resources are not limitless.

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:11.245
If we're going
to try and introduce

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:13.283
a limitless demand
within a limited system,

00:01:13.283 --> 00:01:15.548
we need to address the mechanics of that.

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:17.216
And let's be honest with ourselves.

00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:19.701
we're already buckling
at the limits of our resources

00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:21.468
sustaining mortal existence.

00:01:21.468 --> 00:01:24.154
As wildlife is displaced to meet

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:26.622
the demands of our sprawling
agricultural crops,

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:30.597
many species are being pushed toward
- and beyond - precarious levels.

00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:33.398
We're nowhere near
sustained survival in space,

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:35.498
let alone the colonisation
of other planets,

00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:37.798
so at the moment,
this Earth is all we have.

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:42.303
Will we be able to discipline ourselves,
prepare for these thresholds of expansion,

00:01:42.303 --> 00:01:44.710
and try to work within our current limits?

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.423
Or are we going to deny
the existence of those limits

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:50.787
and walk obliviously towards
unknown levels of crisis.

00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:53.482
Engineer Saul Griffith
conceptualised the problem

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:55.214
in terms of energy consumption.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:58.710
At the moment, our global
energy consumption is 13 terawatts.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.677
In our population of around 6 billion,
that averages to 2.2 kilowatts per person,

00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:06.698
although national
averages vary hugely.

00:02:06.698 --> 00:02:10.057
Consumption in the US is
11.4 kilowatts per person.

00:02:10.057 --> 00:02:14.033
Assuming an equal consumption
of 5 kilowatts per person by 2035

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:15.842
- that's 30 terawatts in total -

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:18.279
Griffith set about showing
the level of resources

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:22.066
that kind of demand would require,
if we exclude fossil fuels.

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.339
If we aim to achieve
5 terawatts of that total

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.204
through conventional nuclear energy,

00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:29.865
that requires 5000 nuclear
reactors over 25 years.

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:32.143
Getting another 5 terawatts
from wind energy

00:02:32.143 --> 00:02:36.920
would require a new, full-size
3-megawatt wind turbine every 3 minutes,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.480
eventually covering 2% of all land area.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.625
Finding 10 terawatts through solar energy

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:45.467
would mean manufacturing 250
square metres of solar cells per second.

00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:48.050
And if we apportion
2 terawatts to bio fuels,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.529
we'll need to generate
4 olympic swimming pools

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.078
of genetically engineered
bacteria per second.

00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:55.898
That still leaves 8 terawatts
unaccounted for.

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:59.491
But something else we've failed
to account for is population growth.

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:01.712
While the current figure
is around 6 billion,

00:03:01.712 --> 00:03:05.683
by 2035, that's expected
to increase to around 8 billion.

00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:10.153
If no one died starting today,
that would soar to over 10 billion.

00:03:10.153 --> 00:03:12.828
This highlights the issue of reproduction.

00:03:12.828 --> 00:03:15.136
If we were able
to put off death indefinitely,

00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:17.141
would we go on producing children?

00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:24.987
If so, how many would we spawn
in our lifetime? Hundreds? Thousands?

00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:28.212
Saul Griffith's statistics
are based on our current lifestyles.

00:03:28.212 --> 00:03:31.967
Of course immortality doesn't necessarily
mean immortality in our present form.

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:33.652
But whatever our proposed form,

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:36.659
immortality would require
two essential conditions.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.131
The first is eternal sustainability.

00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.150
That means the immortal
system can't be subject

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.570
to terminal degenerative
processes such as ageing.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.360
We have already encountered
human cells with this property.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.655
The HeLa cell came from the cervical cells
of one Henrietta Lacks in 1951.

00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:54.963
Where most human cells are limited
in the number of times they can divide,

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:58.550
the HeLa cell seems to have bypassed
this natural in-built senescence.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.406
It's been reproduced
in gargantuan quantities

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:05.178
and involved in all kinds of research
including tests for polio vaccinations,

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:10.253
the effect of zero gravity on human cells,
gene mapping, and cancer research

00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:12.002
which is appropriate considering

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.503
the cervical cells in question
were cancer cells.

00:04:14.503 --> 00:04:18.471
Perhaps unsurprisingly, growth control's
been cited as a major issue,

00:04:18.471 --> 00:04:22.999
with the HeLa cell becoming a significant
contaminant among other cell cultures.

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.894
But even assuming stable
sustainability could be met

00:04:25.894 --> 00:04:28.942
in whatever biological
or non-biological form

00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:33.021
we come up against the second
essential condition: indestructibility.

00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:35.963
To achieve immortality,
the agent must also be impervious

00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:38.584
to all fatal damage from external agents.

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:40.689
We have identified a life-form

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.403
with extraordinary resilience
to environmental extremes.

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:46.491
The tardigrade reaches up to
one-and-a-half millimetres,

00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:48.789
and can survive within
a huge temperature range,

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.489
from almost absolute zero
to around 150 degrees centigrade;

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:54.269
they can withstand doses of radiation


00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:56.929
hundreds of times beyond
the threshold of other animals;

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.642
they've reportedly endured pressures

00:04:58.642 --> 00:05:00.975
around six times that
of the Mariana Trench,

00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:02.826
11 km below the ocean's surface,

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:05.731
and survived for days
in the vacuum of space.

00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:09.002
But all this is nothing compared to
the demands of immortality,

00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:11.933
which necessitates
the endurance or avoidance

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:14.769
of every conceivable environmental hazard.

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:17.594
We have, in effect
to become universe-proof.

00:05:17.594 --> 00:05:19.493
Aside from the more dramatic phenomena

00:05:19.493 --> 00:05:22.256
like black holes and
the collision of galaxies,

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:24.321
there are the more mundane problems.

00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:27.254
If we found ourselves encased in rock
for thousands of years,

00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:29.509
what might that do to us psychologically?

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.375
But let's race by these concerns
and skip to the finish.

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:36.086
Ultimately we begin to refer
to end-of-universe events,

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.692
like the big crunch, or heat death.

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:42.491
When we begin to acknowledge any
universal end which we can't surpass,

00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:46.915
the discussion shifts from immortality
to indefinite longevity.

00:05:46.915 --> 00:05:51.003
In the absence of indestructibility
a counter-intuitive irony emerges.

00:05:51.003 --> 00:05:53.364
Far from decreasing
our anxiety around death,

00:05:53.364 --> 00:05:55.711
we raise it to its highest possible level.

00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:58.299
If we hope for 70 or 80 years of life,

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:01.013
losing a few years,
maybe even a few decades,

00:06:01.013 --> 00:06:02.859
can feel a substantial loss.

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:07.149
But if we achieve eternal
ageless individual sustainability,

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:11.212
the prospect of death is raised
to an indefinitely vast loss.

00:06:11.212 --> 00:06:12.951
In part one of this series,

00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:16.236
I explored some of the divisive and
destructive psychological defences

00:06:16.236 --> 00:06:18.216
we currently employ to deny death.

00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:23.737
Imagine the extremity of defences needed
when that loss is multiplied indefinitely.

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:27.431
Neither I nor QualiaSoup
are pro-mortality.

00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:31.561
Acknowledging the limits we live with is
not equivalent to being in favour of them.

00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:35.748
But we are mindful of the fact that any
bid for significantly enhanced longevity

00:06:35.748 --> 00:06:39.625
will require a considerable rethink
in regard to our physical resources,

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:42.764
as well as considerable
psychological preparations.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:50.025
In 2008 my partner of ten years
was diagnosed with lymphoma

00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:52.301
- cancer of the lymphatic system -

00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:56.993
and within hours of that diagnosis
descended to full life support.

00:06:56.993 --> 00:06:59.939
We were all told to expect the worst.

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:03.807
For days, we did what we could
to prepare for the end.

00:07:03.807 --> 00:07:07.306
I noticed superstitious ideas
bubbling up inside me all the time.

00:07:07.306 --> 00:07:11.650
Ideas like: 'Don't change your route
to the hospital. Change equals death.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.459
If you stick to the same route,
nothing'll change.'

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:16.282
I knew what these thoughts were about.

00:07:16.282 --> 00:07:20.146
They were my attempt to find some
tiny sense of control over a situation

00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:22.822
in which I felt utterly powerless.

00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:27.877
So I changed my route to the hospital
and I resisted several similar notions.

00:07:27.877 --> 00:07:30.700
But eventually I did succumb
to a supernatural comfort.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.435
I began to fantasise about
a magic button I could push,

00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:35.495
that would instantly swap our places.

00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:38.269
I'd be the one in that hospital bed,
about to die.

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:40.849
I longed for that button to materialise.

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.345
Throughout those days, I just kept
pushing my thumb down on thin air.

00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:45.986
The dissonance was tremendous.

00:07:45.986 --> 00:07:48.244
I wanted so desperately for it to be true,


00:07:48.244 --> 00:07:52.034
that my awareness that
it was a fantasy became painful.

00:07:52.034 --> 00:07:56.417
Then the day finally came
when I didn't need the button any more.

00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:59.310
With a last-ditch
experimental drug combination,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.811
the doctors achieved
what no superstition can.

00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:04.614
Through the application
of scientific knowledge and skill,

00:08:04.614 --> 00:08:06.598
they prevented death.

00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:11.019
My partner made a full recovery
and we were married later that year.

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:13.244
Throughout that entire experience,

00:08:13.244 --> 00:08:16.728
the idea of any life beyond this one
never crossed my mind.

00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:19.016
All I could stretch to was a death swap.

00:08:19.016 --> 00:08:20.484
After that experience,

00:08:20.484 --> 00:08:24.117
facing my own possible death in these
last few months was a walk in the park.

00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:26.723
Not a single superstitious
fantasy this time.

00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:30.066
It's simply not true that
there are no atheists in foxholes.

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:32.802
But those who regurgitate
this thought-terminating cliché

00:08:32.802 --> 00:08:35.446
unwittingly concede a remarkable own goal.

00:08:35.446 --> 00:08:37.018
Even if the odd atheist did find

00:08:37.018 --> 00:08:39.904
divine ideas frothing up
in their mind in their last moments,

00:08:39.904 --> 00:08:43.028
are those desperate, irrational,
psychological defences,

00:08:43.028 --> 00:08:47.036
mobilised by a fear of imminent death,
actually being defined as 'theism'?

00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:49.212
Let's boil down
what's being proposed here:

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:53.622
an atheist clutching at straws
in a state of fear is a theist.

00:08:53.622 --> 00:08:57.538
What an extraordinarily revealing
commentary on the nature of faith.

00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:02.536
Some people have asked how I've found
peace of mind in regards to my own death.

00:09:02.536 --> 00:09:06.814
For me, it's about fully embracing
the fact I have nothing to prepare for.

00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:10.223
As humans, we have a peculiar
vulnerability to anxiety.

00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:12.788
We're not confined to reacting
in the here-and-now.

00:09:12.788 --> 00:09:16.002
We've developed the capacity
to look deeply into the future.

00:09:16.002 --> 00:09:18.714
To anticipate problems
and prepare for them.

00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:22.873
Where preparation's possible,
we can act purposefully and productively.

00:09:22.873 --> 00:09:24.712
But when preparation isn't possible,

00:09:24.712 --> 00:09:27.843
we have nowhere useful
to channel our energies.

00:09:27.843 --> 00:09:32.120
If our drive to prepare persists,
we descend into neurosis,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.904
obsessive, unproductive,
impotent thoughts and actions.

00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:38.972
But there is another option.
To stop preparing.

00:09:38.972 --> 00:09:42.097
To bring our thoughts and actions
in line with reality.

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:44.651
There are few times in life
when we get to be absolved

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:46.867
of all possible responsibility
for something.

00:09:46.867 --> 00:09:49.456
Death provides that
liberating opportunity.

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:53.306
If we're honest with ourselves,
and manage to let go of our denials,

00:09:53.306 --> 00:09:57.901
we'll acknowledge the fact that death lies
intrinsically outside of our experience.

00:09:57.901 --> 00:09:59.869
Just like the time before our birth.

00:09:59.869 --> 00:10:02.693
We don't look back on that
pre-conscious time with intense emotion.

00:10:02.693 --> 00:10:04.977
And we needn't do so with death.

00:10:04.977 --> 00:10:08.258
This sentiment's been echoed
by many writers over the centuries.

00:10:08.258 --> 00:10:10.728
Mark Twain, for instance,
who famously said:

00:10:10.728 --> 00:10:12.364
"I do not fear death ...

00:10:12.364 --> 00:10:15.460
I had been dead for billions
and billions of years before I was born,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.879
and had not suffered
the slightest inconvenience from it."

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:23.285
Over two thousand years ago, Lucretius put
forward a similar 'symmetry' argument,

00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:25.477
that those who fear future non-existence,

00:10:25.477 --> 00:10:27.712
should contemplate their
past non-existence.

00:10:27.712 --> 00:10:30.702
If we allow ourselves to contemplate
that past non-existence,

00:10:30.702 --> 00:10:35.146
we might find our fears about
returning to it simply fall away.

00:10:35.146 --> 00:10:38.448
Far from being incompatible
with a realistic awareness of death,

00:10:38.448 --> 00:10:41.139
peace of mind can come
as a direct result of it.

00:10:44.954 --> 00:10:48.925
Therapy works by bringing what's
out of our awareness into our awareness

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:52.723
exposing our illusions,
our assumptions, our defences.

00:10:52.723 --> 00:10:55.376
Sometimes we come to therapy
because coping strategies

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:58.273
that once seemed helpful
are no longer working for us,

00:10:58.273 --> 00:11:00.343
or actively working against us.

00:11:00.343 --> 00:11:03.939
When we become conscious of these
inner conflicts and how they hold us back,

00:11:03.939 --> 00:11:07.025
we have the chance of letting go of them
and moving forward.

00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:10.633
It's not an easy process,
our defences are there for a reason,

00:11:10.633 --> 00:11:14.783
and sometimes removing them will put us in
touch with great pain and vulnerability.

00:11:14.783 --> 00:11:17.668
The prospect of facing that,
after years of comforting denial

00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:20.983
can feel daunting,
sometimes overwhelming.

00:11:20.983 --> 00:11:24.880
Even clients who seem genuinely motivated
can start sabotaging their own therapy

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.624
finding excuses not to put
a plan of action into work,

00:11:27.624 --> 00:11:29.962
maybe even forgetting
to turn up to sessions.

00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:33.549
Sometimes a move towards health
can feel like a backward step.

00:11:33.549 --> 00:11:35.530
It might mean
taking more responsibility,

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.912
getting less attention,
feeling less powerful, less special.

00:11:39.912 --> 00:11:41.324
As Freud noted:

00:11:41.324 --> 00:11:44.869
'The patient wants to be cured,
but he also wants not to be'.

00:11:44.869 --> 00:11:48.374
We see echoes of these processes
played out on a global scale.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.652
Illusion and denial
covering pain and fear.

00:11:51.652 --> 00:11:54.391
Dysfunctional cultural
coping mechanisms, like religion,

00:11:54.391 --> 00:11:56.664
which once might've seemed
to offer great peace,

00:11:56.664 --> 00:11:59.367
but which have become
their own problem to be coped with,

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:01.200
actively stifling our progress,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.630
holding us back at a primitive stage
of development we've long outgrown.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.383
Mechanisms we perpetuate,

00:12:06.383 --> 00:12:09.374
by injecting them into our children
before they can even think,

00:12:09.374 --> 00:12:11.393
forcing them to share our denial,

00:12:11.393 --> 00:12:14.968
never giving them the chance
to experience the pain of realistic loss,

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:18.082
and work through it
in a productive and healthy way.

00:12:18.082 --> 00:12:22.387
And making it all the more devastating
when they discover it's all lies.

00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:24.059
Like the client in therapy,

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:27.614
some of us wish to let go
of these illusions and move forward,

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:29.584
while others resist.

00:12:29.584 --> 00:12:33.535
Again, a move towards health might seem
like a backward step to some

00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:38.321
making some of us feel less special,
taking away some power, some attention,

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.601
requiring greater personal responsibility,

00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:43.266
as our trespasses are not
magically forgiven,

00:12:43.266 --> 00:12:47.286
our guilt is not transubstantiated
into innocence.

00:12:47.286 --> 00:12:49.447
Giving up these false comforts,

00:12:49.447 --> 00:12:52.714
dismantling these fantasies,
is no mean feat.

00:12:52.714 --> 00:12:57.093
They are the most seductive,
beguiling ideas humans have invented,

00:12:57.093 --> 00:13:01.949
drilling right down into
our deepest fears and vanities.

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:05.354
Are we ready to bring these illusions
into our collective consciousness?

00:13:05.354 --> 00:13:08.628
To confront our fears,
rather than recoil from them?

00:13:08.628 --> 00:13:11.929
A few years ago in a video
exploring my transition to atheism,

00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:13.759
I included a brief contemplation

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:17.022
on the tasks involved in leaving
a comforting illusion.

00:13:17.022 --> 00:13:19.072
Many of us have made that transition.


00:13:19.072 --> 00:13:22.018
I hope many more will find
the strength to do so.
