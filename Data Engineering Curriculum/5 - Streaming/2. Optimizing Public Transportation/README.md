# Project: Optimizing Public Transportation
This project constructs a **streaming event pipeline** around **Apache Kafka** and its ecosystem. Using public data from the [Chicago Transit Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/). We will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.


## Project Architecture
The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has asked us to develop a dashboard displaying system status for its commuters. We have decided to use Kafka and ecosystem tools like REST Proxy and Kafka Connect to accomplish this task.

Our architecture will look like so:
