# Dashboard in a Django application
This sample shows how you can create a reporting dashboard in your Django project. The data from an SQLite database is transferred to the client-side data visualization library ([Flexmonster](https://www.flexmonster.com/?r=git_vr)) using Ajax.


# How to run the project

To run the Django development server, execute the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

Next, open the following URL in your browser:
