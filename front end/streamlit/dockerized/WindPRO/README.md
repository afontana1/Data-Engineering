## Features

- **Machine Learning-Enhanced Wind Forecasts**: WindSurfPro uses historical measured wind data to train machine learning models that provide more accurate and reliable wind forecasts for local windsurfing spots. By analyzing patterns and trends, the app can predict wind conditions with improved precision.

- **SQL Database**: As part of your learning journey, WindSurfPro utilizes SQL to manage and store historical wind data. You'll gain hands-on experience with SQL database design, querying, and data manipulation.

- **Cloud Services (AWS)**: This app runs on an AWS server, giving you the opportunity to explore cloud computing and AWS services. You'll learn how to set up, deploy, and maintain applications in a cloud environment.

- **MLOps**: WindSurfPro incorporates MLOps principles, enabling you to practice best practices for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models in production.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Embrace the world of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment by setting up a CI/CD pipeline. Automate the deployment process and ensure that your application is always up to date.

- **Wind Alerts**: Users can receive wind alerts based on the forecasted conditions. This feature demonstrates how to notify users in real-time and keep them informed about the best times for windsurfing.

- **Natural Language Descriptions**: Leveraging a Language Model, WindSurfPro generates natural language descriptions for the wind forecast. This adds a human touch to the forecasts, making them more accessible and engaging.
