## LangChain for LLM application development 

* How to use LLM embeddings and "Retrieval Augmented Generation" to answer questions on proprietary data stored in a vector database
(`lesson-5-QnA.ipynb`)
* How to create "agents", in which one uses the ReAct prompting strategy to allow LLMs to reason and take actions, 
such as calling web APIs and running python code (`lesson-7-agents.ipynb`)
