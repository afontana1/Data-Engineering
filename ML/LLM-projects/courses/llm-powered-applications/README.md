[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart.html) is a leading framework 
for orchestrating the interaction between users and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks that highlight how LangChain 
can be used to build user-facing applications,
in which LLMs are used to reason and to automate tasks. 
See the READMEs in the individual folders for more details.
