## Course Summary
In this course, you will explore the implementation of six applications using vector databases. Here's what you can expect to learn and experience:

1. 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Create a search tool that focuses on the meaning of content for efficient text-based searches on a user Q/A dataset.
