Case1019,followed,Silk Bros. Proprietary Limited v State Electricity Commission of Victoria [1943] HCA 2 ; (1943) 67 CLR 1,"considerations apply to the heading of Division 13A of Part 2 of the Migration Act which also contains the word 'offences.' Pursuant to s 13(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act a heading of a Division is part of the Act. In Silk Bros. Proprietary Limited v State Electricity Commission of Victoria [1943] HCA 2 ; (1943) 67 CLR 1 , Latham CJ said at 16: The headings in a statute...can be taken into consideration in determining the meaning of a provision where that provision is ambiguous, and may sometimes be of service in determining the scope of a provision... ""But where the enacting words are clear and unambiguous, the title, or headings, must give way, and the full effect must be given to the enactment"" ( Bennett v. Minister for Public Works (N.S.W.) [1908] HCA 50 ; (1908) 7 C.L.R. 372 at 383). The Court finds that there is no ambiguity in the text of s 261A. The section speaks of the contravention of the Migration Act as a whole. Ambiguity might arise when that section is read with the heading to the Division, but as observed by Latham CJ, the headings may provide guidance only when the provision itself is ambiguous. Following from the finding that the provision is unambiguous the text of the heading must give way. It may be assumed that if Parliament had intended automatic forfeiture to occur only where 'offences' existed, it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have so provided, taking into consideration the choice of the word 'offences' in the heading of Division 13A of Part 2. It follows that the operation of the automatic forfeiture provision in s 261A of the Migration Act is not limited only to contraventions of the offence provisions of that Act nor is it dependent upon a conviction for an offence. The Court reiterates its finding at [31] of Tran No 1 . Has there been a contravention of the Migration Act ? As has been outlined in [18]-[20] of this judgment, ordinarily the Court cannot revisit a previous judgment that it has made. In Tran No. 1 at [31] the Court found that the Migration Act had been contravened by the applicant. However, a reading of that paragraph also records that the Court provided such answer within the context of a submission by the applicant that 'contravention' in s 261A should be made to be equated with 'offence' in order to enliven an automatic forfeiture. This Court, as stated at [33] of this judgment, finds that the word 'contravention' in s 261A means contravention of the Migration Act generally and not only of the offence provisions, and that contravention is not to be interpreted as being confined to conviction for an offence. The applicant has made a different submission at the subsequent hearing. The applicant now submits that, as a consequence of the acquittals or discontinuance of actions against the applicant, Mr Lai and Mr Nguyen, the automatic forfeiture never took place because the facts giving rise to automatic forfeiture under s 261A , namely contravention of the Migration Act , were never present. Such a submission does not depend on contravention being equated to an offence, nor to conviction of an offence. As was stated at [30]-[31] of Tran No. 1 , following the decision of French J in Olbers , for the automatic forfeiture to arise the Court ' must be satisfied to a high degree of probability ' that contraventions of the Migration Act exist. In Tran No. 1 the Court stated that it was so satisfied but only in the narrow context of that which was submitted relating to the meaning of the word contravention. The new submissions justify the Court considering the new submissions separately to the decision already made even though a different interpretation of the same facts may result in a conclusion incompatible to the answers already given in Tran No. 1 ."

The ship was validly forfeited. No question of payment of compensation arises where the forfeiture results from the incidental exercise of power under the Migration Act since s 51(xxxi) ' applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms ': see Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited and Another v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another [1997] HCA 38 ; (1997) 190 CLR 513 per Gummow J at 595; see authorities referred to in Tran No. 1 at [51]-[53]; see also Mutual Pools &amp; Staff Pty.

Case1022,followed,Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ; (2008) 103 ALD 290,"16 June 2008 the Court delivered its findings in respect of specific questions which were asked of it pursuant to O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth): see Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ; (2008) 103 ALD 290 (' Tran No. 1 '). Since the facts and legislation are set out in that decision, the present decision should be read in conjunction with Tran No. 1 . In Tran No. 1 the Court found that s 261A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Migration Act ') operated to effect an automatic forfeiture of the ship Hao Kiet BL91693TS ('the ship') on or about 1 July 2003 when the ship entered Australia carrying persons who held no valid Australian visas. To answer the specific questions the Court was provided with an agreed statement of facts. The determination of such questions did not finally resolve the rights of the parties since an automatic forfeiture brought about by s 261A of the Migration Act remains contestable: see Tran No. 1 at [45]. The continuation of the hearing in respect of which this judgment is now delivered provided the applicant with the opportunity to provide any evidence upon which he relied to dispute that forfeiture of the ship had occurred. In Tran No. 1 the Court referred to the automatic forfeiture as ' the purported forfeiture ' (at [49]), only as a means of indicating that in these proceedings the applicant could challenge the forfeiture under the mechanism explained in that decision, that is, through the condemnation process. On 9 September 2008 the applicant filed a Further Amended Application seeking a declaration that the ship is not forfeited, or, in the alternative, a declaration that any forfeiture ' including under s 261A of the Migration Act , is revoked ' and further declarations relating to the right of the applicant to possession of the ship. The Further Amended Application also seeks declarations relating to claims for damages arising from the alleged unauthorised destruction and/or loss of possession of the ship. A Further Amended Statement of Claim was also filed on 9 September 2008. The Further Amended Statement of Claim raised the following claim (at [4]): At all material times the Applicant was responding to a sudden and extraordinary emergency and believed that each of the Vietnamese citizens who so fled from Vietnam to Australia were entitled to receive protection from Australia by virtue of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugee ['the Refugee Convention ']. For these reasons the applicant submits that there is no relevant contravention of the Migration Act , and that in the absence thereof there has been no forfeiture and accordingly the Court should not confirm the automatic forfeiture. The applicant invites the Court to revisit its findings in Tran No. 1 in light of its further submissions. The applicant claims that there has been a trespass to his property or intentional or negligent interference with his property and that just terms are payable under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) in respect of the loss of the ship. The claim for damages is itemised in the amount of $307,274.85."
Case1023,referred to,Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council and Others [1982] HCA 41 ; (1982) 149 CLR 672,"considering the substance of the applicant's claims, it is to be observed that ordinarily the Court cannot revisit its findings. In Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council and Others [1982] HCA 41 ; (1982) 149 CLR 672 at 684 Mason ACJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:- ...the circumstances in which this Court will reopen a judgment which it has pronounced are extremely rare. The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution. Generally speaking, it will not be exercised unless the applicant can show that by accident without fault on his part he has not been heard. Similarly, Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc. and Another v Dyason and Others (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 303 said that the power of the Court to reconsider judgments would not be exercised for the purpose of ' re-agitating arguments already considered by the Court ', nor ' because the party seeking a rehearing has failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might have been put '."
Case1024,cited,Whim Creek Consolidated NL v Colgan [1991] FCA 467 ; (1991) 31 FCR 469,"appeal (see Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth and Another [2004] FCAFC 262 ; (2004) 143 FCR 449) the Full Court explicitly adopted the findings of French J that forfeiture under s 106A of the FMA took place without conviction for any offence. As to the condemnation procedure provided by s 106B to s 106G of the FMA, the Full Court in Olbers [2004] FCAFC 262 ; 143 FCR 449 , adopting the reasoning in Whim Creek Consolidated NL v Colgan [1991] FCA 467 ; (1991) 31 FCR 469 at 477-478, determined that such provision enabled the recording of the forfeiture having already occured: see Olbers [2004] FCAFC 262 ; 143 FCR 449 at [16] - [17] ; Tran No. 1 at [43]."
Case1025,discussed,Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) [1987] HCA 26 ; (1987) 162 CLR 645,"Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vict.) [1987] HCA 26 ; (1987) 162 CLR 645 Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ discussed the origins of the modern law of self defence. They observed that such defence arose out of a context in which two kinds of defence to homicide, a defence of 'justification' and one of 'excuse', were available. The consequences of each defence were distinct, as their Honours considered at 657-658: Justifiable homicide carried with it commendation rather than blame and accordingly entitled the accused to total acquittal, entailing no forfeiture and requiring no pardon... Excusable homicide, on the other hand, was not entirely without blame and merely excused rather than acquitted, requiring, at first, a pardon and involving, for a somewhat longer period, forfeiture. Such distinctions no longer exist, but this context led their honours to find (at 658) that self defence, ' as we now know it, was essentially exculpatory in origin '. The difference between the defences considered above demonstrates that, at the common law at least, one might be said to a have contravened the law even if a defence to a charge were available. There can be no doubt that the Criminal Code was intended to provide a principled and logical analytical regime for Commonwealth criminal law and thus substantially remove inconsistencies found in the common law. For example, the defence of necessity at common law did not apply to murder: see R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273. However, the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency is not so limited in the Criminal Code and it applies to all Commonwealth offences. The Criminal Code codified a basis for criminal responsibility distinct from that at common law as discussed in R v Oblach [2005] NSWCCA 440 ; (2005) 65 NSWLR 75. Spigelman CJ said of the structure of the Criminal Code (at [28]): Criminal responsibility under the Code arises from the combined effect of the presence of the elements in Pt 2.2 [General Principles of Criminal Responsibility] and the absence or failure of the elements in Pt 2.3 [Circumstances in which there is no Criminal Responsibility]. This structure differs from the position at common law in which it is appropriate to treat certain matters as ""defences"", for example, self defence is ""exculpatory"". ( Zecevic (at 658-659)). [Emphasis added] In an article published in Judicial Review entitled ' The Commonwealth Criminal Code : An Introduction to the General Principle s' the author Ian Leader-Elliot wrote:- Proof of the necessary physical and fault elements does not, of itself, establish guilt. Though all elements of an offence are established against a defendant, guilt may be defeated by reliance on a defence. Chapter 2 [of the Criminal Code ] adopts a binary structure in which ""responsibility"" is a compound resulting from proof of all elements of the offence, combined with disproof or failure of all defences that are open on the evidence... There are, it should be said, significant departures from the common law in the articulation of a number of offences. [(2002) 5 Judicial Review 4 at 301] On such analysis, if the requirements of s 10.3 are satisfied it must follow that there can be no criminal responsibility and therefore no offence."

Case1037,applied,Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57,"Only the first two of these causes of action are relied upon by the Applicants in a claim for interlocutory injunctive relief against the Respondents. The Respondents have sought to meet that claim for interlocutory injunctive relief not by the giving of particular undertakings but rather by submitting that, having regard to the principles which attend the granting of interlocutory injunctive relief, no claim for such relief is made out. Those principles are not in doubt. In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 at 81-82, [65], Gummow and Hayne JJ, with whom Gleeson CJ and Crennan J agreed in this regard (at 68, [19]) stated: ""The relevant principles in Australia are those explained in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618. This court (Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ) said that on such applications the court addresses itself to two main inquiries and continued: 'The first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to a relief ... The second inquiry is ... whether the inconvenience or injury which is the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted.' By using the phrase 'prima facie case', their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial."" 10 Whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction requires the exercise of a discretion informed by the application of these principles to the circumstances of the case as revealed by the material before the court at the time of the application. 11 The Applicants' claim for infringement of copyright is not, in my opinion, a strong one on present materials."

At best, it might perhaps be inferred that, as a matter of business practice, it was mutually understood as between Linmac or its alleged successive assignees and third parties that the drawings contained at least some confidential information."

Case1042,cited,Ocular Sciences Limited v Aspec Vision Care Limited [1997] RPC 289,"Another cautionary note was sounded by Laddie J in Ocular Sciences Limited v Aspec Vision Care Limited [1997] RPC 289 at 359: "".. it is well recognised that breach of confidence actions can be used to oppress and harass competitors and ex-employees. The Courts are therefore careful to ensure that the plaintiff gives full and proper particulars of all the confidential information upon which he intends to rely in the proceedings. If the plaintiff fails to do this the Court may infer that the purpose of the litigation is harassment rather than the protection of the plaintiff's rights and may strike out the action as an abuse of process."" . 31 The Respondents do not seek that the proceedings be struck out. That is not to say that the sentiments voiced in the passages just quoted are irrelevant. The First Respondent is certainly embarked upon a path that may see it come to be a competitor of the Applicants. It is a serious thing to allege that persons have breached a duty of confidence in respect of confidential information. There is force, in my opinion, in the Respondents' submission that there is no evidence that any of them have misused or are going to misuse any confidential information of the Applicants. It must be observed as well that similar difficulties to those which I have highlighted in relation to the breach of copyright claim attend the proof of the Applicants' ownership of the allegedly confidential information. Further, just what is said to constitute the information having the necessary quality of confidence is not identified with precision on the present state of the evidence. That in itself is telling as a person to whom injunctive relief is granted ought not be put in a position of doubt as to what is enjoined. 32 In short then it seems to me that, on the present state of the materials, the basis for there being a serious question to be tried is at least weak but better regarded as wanting."

Case1046,referred to,Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608,"By order made herein dated 7 November 2007 I appointed Mr Colin Nicol as receiver to deal with certain funds which had been held in the names of the respondent, the Terra Nova Cache and the Principality of Camside. The circumstances in which the receiver came to be appointed are explained in my judgment in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. Mr Nicol entered on his task promptly. He has discovered various funds which are additional to those which are identified in Schedule A of the order made on 7 November 2007. He has also identified a large number of persons who claim to have made deposits in the Terra Nova Cache. He has sought the co-operation and assistance of the respondent in identifying depositors and the whereabouts of moneys contributed by them. He has received very little assistance from the respondent in response to these requests. 2 By an Amended Notice of Motion dated 4 February 2008 Mr Nicol seeks various orders to assist him in the performance of his duties. I heard argument on the Amended Notice of Motion on 6 February 2008. Following argument I indicated that I would make orders in the terms of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Amended Notice of Motion and would publish reasons for doing so at a later date. I reserved judgment on whether orders in the terms proposed in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the Amended Notice of Motion should be made. What follows are my reasons for making orders 1 to 3 and my reasons, following further consideration, for determining that orders in the terms proposed in paragraphs 5 and 6 (with some minor variations) should be made. 3 The first order sought by Mr Nicol is the addition of a number of funds to those identified in Schedule A of the order which I made on 7 November 2007. The evidence established, in each case, a reasonable basis for the conclusion that the source of the moneys in those funds was contributions made to the Terra Nova Cache or the Principality of Camside. Counsel for the respondent did not direct any specific argument to the question of whether order 1 should or should not be made. It is appropriate that the order should be made. 13 Counsel for the receiver argued that these orders should be made because the respondent had, during the period of the receivership, failed to respond to requests made by the receiver that he provide relevant documents to the receiver. In particular the receiver relied on the failure of the respondent to comply with paragraph five of the orders made on 7 November 2007 which required the respondent to provide to the receiver ""all bank statements, books of accounts, receipts, invoices, correspondence or other documents in his possession, custody, power or control relating to monies received from members of the public for deposit in the Terra Nova Cache."" The receiver's solicitor had written on numerous occasions to the respondent requesting that he comply with the Court's order. The respondent had not done so. He had, through his solicitors, made general claims that he could not be required to produce any documents because of the protection afforded him by the privilege against self incrimination. In one letter the respondent acknowledged that he had three documents (bank statements) which fell within the terms of the order. He also provided the receiver with a copy of documentary evidence tendered in the course of the trial of the principal proceeding in which the order appointing the receiver was made: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. The respondent has failed to advise the receiver whether there are additional documents, which although not in his possession, are within his power or control. 14 Counsel for the respondent opposed the making of the proposed orders. He made what he described as ""an in limine objection"" to the making of any order that would require the respondent to swear an affidavit of documents or discover any documents on the ground that to do so would infringe his right to protection against self incrimination. 15 In making the in limine objection counsel for the respondent relied on an affidavit, sworn by the respondent, in which he deposed that: ""3. It has been alleged that with respect to the Principality of Camside and Terra Nova Cache, I am in breach if the Banking Act , sections 7 and 66 , which are respectively an indictable offence and an offence. Such allegations have already been tried herein and found proven on a civil basis, and it has been maintained by APRA, a Commonwealth instrumentality, that the right to bring criminal charges against me with respect of the alleged breaches of the relevant sections remains extant. 4. The documents requested clearly relate to the alleged breaches of the Act and, accordingly, I object to producing the same pursuant to the right against self incrimination."" It is noted that the respondent makes an in limine objection to production. He does not identify the documents for which a privilege claim is made. He does not explain why their production would tend to incriminate him. Moreover he offers no reason why he should not be required to swear an affidavit of documents. 19 As already noted counsel for the respondent sought to argue that the circumstances which confronted the respondent in this case were such as to bring it within the exceptional category which Deane J referred to in Refrigerated Express. I invited counsel to articulate with precision the rare and exceptional circumstances which rendered the present case one which fell within the exception to the ordinary rule. He submitted that his client had been found, in Siminton (No 6) , to have contravened ss 7 and 66 of the Banking Act . These findings had been made on the civil standard. His client apprehended that he might, at some time in the future, be charged with having committed criminal offences by contravening those provisions. He contended that the mere acknowledgement by the respondent that he had in his possession, custody or control documents of the character referred to in the proposed order could be used in evidence against him in such a criminal proceeding."
Case1047,followed,Refrigerated Express Lines (A/sia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (1979) 42 FLR 204,"Counsel acknowledged that the circumstances in which an in limine objection to making an affidavit of documents, in a case such as the present, might be upheld are extremely rare. He contended that the circumstances of the present case brought it within the rare exception, the existence of which was recognised by Deane J in Refrigerated Express Lines (A/asia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live Stock Corporation (1979) 42 FLR 204. In Refrigerated Express Deane J held that, in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding in which the imposition of a pecuniary penalty was sought, a Court should not order a respondent to give discovery or produce documents for inspection. In other forms of proceeding his Honour recognised that the general rule was that a party ought not to be excused, in limine , from giving discovery on the ground that production might tend to expose him to a penalty. His Honour held that there might exist ""exceptional"" cases in which ""the only means of protecting the right against self incrimination ... [would be] to excuse a party in limine from discovery ..."" (at 211) (Emphasis added). His Honour said that such cases would be ""rare indeed."" He said (at 211) that: ""The cases where the making of an order for discovery or interrogatories will, in itself, involve exposing a party to self incrimination ... must, however, be rare indeed in view of the fact that the party will remain entitled to refuse to answer questions asked or produce documents discovered if the answers or production might tend to incriminate him or expose him to a penalty."" Deane J's judgment was referred to in the joint judgment of Mason A.C.J., Wilson and Dawson JJ in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1983) 152 CLR 328 at 336. Their Honours noted that: ""There [in Refrigerated Express] his Honour drew a distinction between discovery in a mere action for a penalty and discovery in an action which was not for a penalty the result of which might be used to establish a party's liability to a penalty in other proceedings (50). In the first situation, the court should, in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary, refuse to make any order for discovery, production of documents or the provision of information for the reason that an intended consequence of the discovery, production of documents or provision of information is the imposition of the penalty, this being the object of the action ... But in the second situation the order will be made and the party against whom the order is made may object to the production of particular documents or to the provision of particular information on the ground that it may tend to expose him to a penalty."" 17 In Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 Lindgren J reviewed a series of cases in which Deane J's decision in Refrigerated Express had been applied or followed. He summarised his conclusions as follows (at 388): ""Although the course of authority since Refrigerated Express is not all one way, there has been a strong disposition in a proceeding not itself concerned with the imposition of a penalty for an offence or a civil penalty, in favour of ordering discovery, reserving the issue of self incrimination to the stage of production for inspection, and also reserving liberty to apply in relation to the degree of specificity with which a document is to be described in the individual's list of documents."" 19 As already noted counsel for the respondent sought to argue that the circumstances which confronted the respondent in this case were such as to bring it within the exceptional category which Deane J referred to in Refrigerated Express.

Case1052,cited,Auskay International Marketing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458,"preliminary attack was made on the use of the concept of point of origin or destination of a service as a reference point able to be used in the Notices. It was contended that the Notices (even if confined to outbound services) did not sufficiently describe a matter involving a contravention of the Act, particularly in failing to describe the market in Australia. I accept that just because services cover the movement of goods in or out of Australia, does not necessarily indicate that there is a relevant market located in Australia in respect of those services: see Auskay International Marketing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 at [19] and [21] per Tracey J. However, as I mention later, the Notices when properly construed adequately describe matters capable of involving a contravention of the Act and by reference to a market in Australia. I make one further observation as to the Notices. The identified matters concern the alleged contravention of s 45 of the Act and concentrate on the supply of the international air cargo services. However, as I have alluded to earlier, it is important to observe that the description of the matters in the Notices concern price fixing as defined by s 45A of the Act, and it is upon that provision attention should be focussed in interpreting the Notices. Justice Tracey in Auskay FCA 1458 did observe that '[b]uyers and sellers of goods and services must negotiate and enter transactions in an area in which suppliers are engaged in close competition with each other' and '[t]hat area must be located within Australia' (at [19]). However, his Honour also referred to the importance of the place where the relevant competition takes place, and where parties compete to obtain contracts (at [21]). I do not read his Honour's comments (made in the context of a pleading dispute) as dictating that in determinating the geographic location of the market one is confined by the location of the making of the contract for the subject services. Once it is accepted that the place of contracting is not determinative, then in view of the above reasoning, it cannot be concluded that the particular conduct complained of is not capable of constituting a contravention of the Act. We are not then dealing with a market that is wholly outside Australia, but rather, with a possible contravention s 45 of the Act in relation to inbound and outbound services in a market in Australia. Therefore, upon construing the Notices in the manner indicated, I do not regard them as invalid on the ground that the matters the subject of them extend beyond conduct that is capable of constituting a contravention of the Act."
Case1053,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976,"notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): Although the notion of a ""market in Australia"" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a ""market in Australia"" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era. Justice Lindgren went on to conclude that the definition of ""market in Australia"" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. As other aspects of the decision in Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 proceeded upon agreed facts, however, that case provides little assistance in determining the other issues raised before me which involved 'a concrete dispute reached after contest in argument': see Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [62] (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ)."
Case1054,cited,Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127,"principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: (a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. (b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. (c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J. (d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]). (e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein. (f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J). (g) In Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 136 ALR 453 , Lindgren J said (at 468): It is for an applicant to make out its case of ""failure to take into account"", but the circumstances may be such that the applicant will be aided in this task by an absence of evidence from the decision-maker on a particular matter, such as an absence of evidence giving rise to an inference of a failure to make further inquiries when a genuine taking into account would have called for them."
Case1055,cited,Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446,"accept that evidence that was not before the decision-maker may be admissible if it is relevant to a particular ground of review, such as unreasonableness: see, eg, Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 , 564-66 per Weinberg J; but see Aronson M, Dyer B, and Groves M, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 2009) at 256-58. In addition, sometimes it will also be necessary to have established the facts upon which legal issues can be resolved. In the Singapore Airlines proceeding, the parties filed a statement of agreed facts concerning the supply of international air cargo services, which included the following statements and facts: The following facts are agreed between the parties for the purpose of s 191 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Unless stated otherwise, the facts are applicable as at all relevant times, being the period 1 January 2000 to date. 1. Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) is incorporated in Singapore. SIA supplies international air transport services to passengers on routes between many different countries, including on routes between Australia and other countries. The hub of SIA's international passenger services is in Singapore. Prior to 1 July 2001, SIA operated a Cargo Division which supplied air transport services for cargo on routes between many different countries, including on routes between Australia and other countries. Air freight is transported either in the 'bellyhold' or lower deck of passenger aircraft or in cargo 'freighters', i.e. planes dedicated to carrying cargo. Prior to 1 July 2001, SIA's Cargo Division supplied international air freight services using both passenger aircraft and cargo freighters. Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd (SIAC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of SIA. It is incorporated in Singapore. With effect on 1 July 2001, SIA transferred to SIAC the assets, liabilities, cargo-related contracts, operations and business activities of the Cargo Division of SIA. With effect on 3 July 2001, employees of the Cargo Division of SIA ceased to be employed by SIA and were transferred to SIAC. Since that time, only SIAC has supplied international air transport services for cargo within the Singapore Airlines group of companies. SIAC conducts business in 57 countries worldwide including Australia and SIA or SIAC operate aircraft in 38 countries. SIAC or its general sales agents operate out of 76 stations located at international airports to or from which SIAC will carry or arrange for the carriage of cargo. A list of those countries and stations is annexed and marked ""A"". Each station provides services in relation to the airport at which it is located. In Australia, SIAC currently operates stations at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth international airports. The stations that SIA previously operated at Cairns and at Darwin were closed in March 2001. To supply international air transport services for cargo, SIAC purchases from SIA all non-passenger baggage space in the bellyhold of SIA's passenger airplanes and also operates cargo freighters. The operating fleet of SIAC as at 31 March 2007 comprised 14 B747-400 cargo freighters. SIAC also purchases cargo space from other carriers, or carriage services by road transport operators. Typically SIAC will do this in order to deliver freight to airports which are not serviced by either SIA or SIAC aircraft or to allow stations to access available cargo space on SIA or SIAC aircraft which are operated from another station. Singapore is the main hub and freight distribution centre for SIAC. Charts depicting the routes flown by SIAC freighter aircraft and SIA passenger aircraft as at March 2007 are shown in the routing charts annexed and marked ""B"". SIAC can offer a freight service from any of its origin ports to Australia, routed through Singapore. The types of freight that are shipped from different countries and different cities can differ substantially. Carriers offer different types of air freight services from different locations in order to meet the requirements of the particular types of freight that are transported from those locations. For example, much of the freight shipped out of Melbourne is perishables such as meat, fruit and vegetables. This type of freight may need to be transported quickly and kept at special temperatures. ... (The annexures referred to above are not annexed to this judgment.) A substantial amount of additional evidence was adduced by the parties in both proceedings, and the ACCC cross-examined a number of witnesses called by Emirates and Singapore Airlines. Evidence received in each proceeding was to be treated as evidence in the other. Some objections were taken to certain evidence sought to be tendered by the parties, which in light of the approach I adopt, need not be ruled upon. No attack was made upon the credit of any witness, although the ACCC submitted that the evidence was far from conclusive and should not be relied upon as contended for by the applicants. Some of the evidence was of a confidential nature and appropriate orders were made under ss 17 and 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In giving these reasons for judgment I have not found it necessary to refer to this evidence other than in a general way. The primary purpose of the evidence led was to provide the factual background concerning the markets in which international air cargo services are ordinarily supplied. Such evidence was said to support the argument that the Court could be satisfied that international air cargo services on routes into Australia, and between two points outside Australia, are not competitively provided in a market in Australia. Evidence was also led concerning what became known as the 'burden issue'. That evidence dealt with the steps required to be taken by Singapore Airlines and Emirates to comply with some of the notices. It also concerned the manner and extent to which Mr Samuel had regard to the burden imposed on the recipients, and what considerations he took into account in deciding to issue the Notices."
Case1056,cited,Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372,"principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: (a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. (b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. (c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J. (d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]). (e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein. (f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J). (g) In Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 136 ALR 453 , Lindgren J said (at 468): It is for an applicant to make out its case of ""failure to take into account"", but the circumstances may be such that the applicant will be aided in this task by an absence of evidence from the decision-maker on a particular matter, such as an absence of evidence giving rise to an inference of a failure to make further inquiries when a genuine taking into account would have called for them."
Case1057,cited,Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581,"is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information ""relating"" to one or more ""matters"" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary ""relatedness"" is not to be approached in an ""over-technical or hypercritical way"": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the ""relatedness"" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have ""reason to believe"" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J. It follows that the Chairperson or other officer must believe that the person to whom the notice is directed is capable of furnishing information relating to the facts known or suspected: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. (iv) The word ""matter"" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words ""may constitute"" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not ""idly speculate"" or ""draw on improbable circumstances"" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may ""reasonably be suspected"" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an ""over-technical or hypercritical approach"" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice ""plead"" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. (viii) Information which tends to negative a suspected contravention or liability to conviction or which tends to exculpate a person suspected to be a party to a contravention, is within the ambit of s 155(1). It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74 If the Notices were properly framed and only referred to services in relation to outbound routes, then on the applicants' case, the fact that there may be acquirers of those services outside Australia would not affect the validity of the Notices on this primary ground of attack. It would be accepted there is a market in Australia. No suggestion would be made that the Notices are enquiring into a matter not the subject of the Notice in reliance of the principles outlined in Bannerman [1984] FCA 156 ; 2 FCR 581 , Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 and Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd [1912] HCA 69 ; 15 CLR 333."

In any event, for the reasons I have already given, whilst the burden of some of the Notices, having regard to the original time limit, was objectively harsh and oppressive, the decision to issue such Notices was not so unreasonable (or illogical or irrational) that it could not have been made in the circumstances. Even if I looked to the question of 'proportionally', it seems to me that having regard to the very nature, breadth and extent of the investigation, the consequences of the burden were not such as to demonstrate unreasonableness so as to impugn the decision: see discussion in Bruce 45 NSWLR 163, at 184-5 per Spigelman CJ. I would reach this conclusion even on the basis of the evidence sought to be tendered by the applicants on the burden issue, although its relevance may be questionable&#8212;see above [13]. A final point was raised by the ACCC that if the applicants succeeded only in relation to their arguments on burden, I should not grant the relief sought as the initial time frame for the Notices in contention has been extended by a variation to the Notices. That such variations have occurred is not in contention. The only attack of the applicants is on the decision to issue the Notices and the Notices in their original form. No complaint is now made as to the extended time frame, there being no attack on the decisions varying the Notices."

In proceedings of this nature I would not expect Mr Samuel to provide direct evidence: see eg Korean Air Lines v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2008] FCA 701 at [116] per Jacobsen J. The only available evidence suggesting that Mr Samuel might have taken into account the effect of issuing the Notices on the applicants is derived from the Reason to Believe papers, and the objective matters available to Mr Samuel at the time of the issuing of the Notices, including the Notices themselves. Many identical s 155 notices were issued at the same time to many airlines. The Reason to Believe papers seemed to be prepared in standard form for each such notice. This also applied to the 'burden' of the Notices. No allowance seems to have been made for the different burden that may have been imposed on different airlines by reason of the fact that their operations differed in scale and geographic scope."
Case1066,cited,Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163,"is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ). In addition, regard may be had to the identity of, and the knowledge available to, the recipient of the notice: see Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , 189 at [75] (per Sackville and Emmett JJ). It is important to keep in mind that it is an investigative power which is under consideration in these proceedings. As stated by the Full Court in Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd [1980] FCA 94 ; 47 FLR 163 (at 174): The investigative power may properly be exercised by inquiring into the existence of facts which do not themselves constitute a contravention or deny the possibility of a contravention. The power may properly be exercised to ascertain facts which may merely indicate a further line of inquiry, or which may tend to prove circumstances from which an inference can be drawn as to the existence of other facts which have a more immediate and proximate relationship to the matter under investigation. The applicants are involved in international activities, and decisions and discussions concerning the matter under investigation may readily be accepted as having occurred overseas, as well as in Australia. The conduct of the applicants wherever occurring could be relevant to the investigation of the matter as defined in the Notices. It is not for this Court to confine or restrict the course of an investigation if the powers conferred by s 155 have not been exceeded. In relation to the interpretation of the Notices, the applicants allege that the definition of 'Fuel Surcharge' is wide and unclear. However, to the extent that the applicants have responded to the Notices, they appear to have had no difficulty at all in understanding the meaning of the term. It seems to me that the applicants should be, and in fact are, well versed in the concept of 'Fuel Surcharge'."

Similarly, Mason J in Peko Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; 162 CLR 24 said (at 40): The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind. It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator. Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion, and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned: ( Wednesbury Corporation , at 228)."
Case1069,cited,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"seems to me that the 'burden' sections of the Reason to Believe papers were pro-forma statements. This is not necessarily to be unexpected. The use of such standard paragraphs is not fatal in itself. However, if a verbal formula is used 'to cloak the decision with the appearance of conformity with the law', the use of that formula will not save the decision from invalidity: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 266 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. The 'burden' sections of the Rason to Believe papers in dealing with the time for compliance specifically refer to the magnitude of the burden imposed and to the time in which the recipient could provide the information and documents. Consideration was then given to the burden generally and, specifically, to the time in which a recipient would need to make the necessary searches and enquiries, collate the material necessary and obtain legal advice. Significantly, Mr Samuel was reminded that he needed to consider the magnitude of the burden. This indicates that the Reason to Believe papers did not contain the only information relied upon by Mr Samuel, although they contained recommendations. I am not satisfied that the requirement to comply within a certain limited time was imposed without regard to the ultimate burden which it would impose on the recipient, even on the facts as I have found as to the burden objectively imposed."
Case1070,cited,NT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power and Water Authority (2004) 219 CLR 90,"the operation of s 45 of the Act, a key concept is 'market'. There is a plethora of case law regarding the meaning of that term, but the High Court has warned that attempts to define 'market' too precisely are dangerous. In NT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power and Water Authority (2004) 219 CLR 90 , the High Court advocated a broader approach, stating (at 117): The Act is seeking to advance the broad goal of promoting competition. Certain provisions of the Act, particularly in Pt IV, necessarily turn to a significant degree on expressions which are not precise or formally exact. One example is ""market"": there can be overlapping markets with blurred limits and disagreements between bona fide and reasonable experts about their definition, as in this case. Other examples are ""substantial"", ""competition"", ""arrangement"", ""understanding"", ""purpose"" and ""reason"" (which need only be a ""substantial"" purpose or reason: s 4F). It is not appropriate to subject the application of this type of legislation to a process of anatomising, filleting and dissecting... . (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)"
Case1071,cited,Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 65 ; (1982) 152 CLR 460,"observed by Gibbs CJ in Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 65 ; (1982) 152 CLR 460 , '[t]he power [under s 155] is a drastic power and is capable of abuse and must be exercised with care' (at 468). The time for compliance has statutory significance. The recipient is obliged to furnish the information sought within the time specified in the notice, and must produce the documents sought in accordance with the notice: subs 155(1). It is an offence to fail to comply: subs 155(5) and (6A). These are matters that needed to be considered by Mr Samuel, as they undoubtedly were, as part of the statutory context of issuing the Notices and as part of the consequences of non-compliance. Once one reaches the conclusion that the decision to issue the Notices was exercised with care, took into account the relevant considerations, and was not to be impugned on the basis of the principles in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 , then the reference to the statutory significance of compliance takes the argument no further."
Case1072,followed,Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368,"is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information ""relating"" to one or more ""matters"" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary ""relatedness"" is not to be approached in an ""over-technical or hypercritical way"": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the ""relatedness"" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have ""reason to believe"" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J. It follows that the Chairperson or other officer must believe that the person to whom the notice is directed is capable of furnishing information relating to the facts known or suspected: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. (iv) The word ""matter"" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words ""may constitute"" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not ""idly speculate"" or ""draw on improbable circumstances"" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may ""reasonably be suspected"" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an ""over-technical or hypercritical approach"" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice ""plead"" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. (viii) Information which tends to negative a suspected contravention or liability to conviction or which tends to exculpate a person suspected to be a party to a contravention, is within the ambit of s 155(1). It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74 If the Notices were properly framed and only referred to services in relation to outbound routes, then on the applicants' case, the fact that there may be acquirers of those services outside Australia would not affect the validity of the Notices on this primary ground of attack. It would be accepted there is a market in Australia. No suggestion would be made that the Notices are enquiring into a matter not the subject of the Notice in reliance of the principles outlined in Bannerman [1984] FCA 156 ; 2 FCR 581 , Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 and Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd [1912] HCA 69 ; 15 CLR 333. It then remains to address the application of the principles enunciated in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 . Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ there observed (at 377-8): There remains to be considered the availability to the appellants of the grounds upon which they object to a particular requirement to produce documents, namely, that it is harsh, oppressive and unreasonable. The mere fact that compliance with a requirement to furnish information or to produce documents would be burdensome will not invalidate that requirement in a s.155 notice (see Melbourne Home of Ford v Trade Practices Commission (No. 3) ; Riley McKay Pty Ltd v Bannerman ). Nor will objective harshness, unreasonableness or oppressiveness of a requirement in such a notice constitute an independent ground of invalidity. If invalidity by reference to these qualities is to be established, it must be by reference to the implied general limitation upon the power conferred by s 155(1) of the Act to which reference has already been made, namely, that it is a condition of a valid exercise of the power that it be used in good faith for the purpose for which it was conferred and with regard to the effect that the exercise of the power will have upon those affected thereby. It is only if the harshness, oppressiveness or unreasonableness of a requirement in a s 155 notice is, in all the circumstances, such as to warrant the conclusion that the requirement could not have been imposed in good faith or could only have been imposed to achieve a collateral purpose or without regard to the burden which it would impose upon the recipient, that harshness, oppressiveness or unreasonableness will result in invalidity. (Emphasis added, citations omitted.) I have already concluded that Mr Samuel had regard to the burden imposed on the applicants. It now remains to consider the question of good faith, and a possible separate issue of unreasonableness. To a certain extent, the issues of failing to take into account the burden, good faith and unreasonableness overlap. Obviously, a requirement may be harsh, unreasonable and oppressive, and still not result in invalidity. As observed by Gibbs CJ in Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 65 ; (1982) 152 CLR 460 , '[t]he power [under s 155] is a drastic power and is capable of abuse and must be exercised with care' (at 468). The time for compliance has statutory significance. The recipient is obliged to furnish the information sought within the time specified in the notice, and must produce the documents sought in accordance with the notice: subs 155(1). It is an offence to fail to comply: subs 155(5) and (6A). These are matters that needed to be considered by Mr Samuel, as they undoubtedly were, as part of the statutory context of issuing the Notices and as part of the consequences of non-compliance. Once one reaches the conclusion that the decision to issue the Notices was exercised with care, took into account the relevant considerations, and was not to be impugned on the basis of the principles in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 , then the reference to the statutory significance of compliance takes the argument no further. I now turn to the separate ground relied upon of unreasonableness. It may be that the concept of unreasonableness is caught within the principles of Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368. Nevertheless, I do not consider that approaching the matter on the basis of unreasonableness, even if a separate ground to consider apart from the approach taken in Pyneboard , further advances the arguments of the applicants in support of their applications."
Case1073,cited,Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177,"addition Dawson J observed in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 (at 198-99): Lying behind both of those questions is the concept of the market, a concept which is sometimes dealt with in a more complex manner than is necessary. A market is an area in which the exchange of goods or services between buyer and seller is negotiated. It is sometimes referred to as the sphere within which price is determined and that serves to focus attention upon the way in which the market facilitates exchange by employing price as the mechanism to reconcile competing demands for resources: see Stigler and Sherwin, ""The Extent of the Market"", (1985) 28 Journal of Law and Economics vol 28 (1985) 555 at p. 555. In setting the limits of a market the emphasis has historically been placed upon what is referred to as the ""demand side"", but more recently the ""supply side"" has also come to be regarded as significant. The basic test involves the ascertainment of the cross-elasticities of both supply and demand, that is to say, the extent to which the supply of or demand for a product responds to a change in the price of another product. Cross-elasticities of supply and demand reveal the degree to which one product may be substituted for another, an important consideration in any definition of a market. This is reflected in s 4E of the Trade Practices Act which provides: ""For the purposes of this Act, 'market' means a market in Australia and, when used in relation to any goods or services, includes a market for those goods or services and other goods or services that are substitutable for, or otherwise competitive with , the first-mentioned goods or services"" (My emphasis.) Important as they are, elasticities and the notion of substitution provide no complete solution to the definition of a market. A question of degree is involved &#8212; at what point do different goods become closely enough linked in supply or demand to be included in the one market &#8212; which precludes any dogmatic answer. See Times-Picayune v United States . (Citations omitted.)"
Case1074,cited,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59,"separate allegation of unreasonableness, particularly in the statutory context of s 155 of the Act, needs to be approached with caution. As Gleeson CJ said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [5] : ... to describe reasoning as illogical, or unreasonable, or irrational, may merely be an emphatic way of expressing disagreement with it. If it is suggested that there is a legal consequence, it may be necessary to be more precise as to the nature and quality of the error attributed to the decision-maker, and to identify the legal principle or statutory provision that attracts the suggested consequence."
Case1075,followed,Re Tooth &amp; Co Ltd [1978] FCA 9 ; (1978) 31 FLR 314,"my view, the Court does have a discretion to refuse relief in such circumstances, even to the extent the application is brought under s 163A of the Act: see, eg, Re Tooth &amp; Co Ltd [1978] FCA 9 ; (1978) 31 FLR 314. As I have said, time for compliance has been extended. This time frame is not in dispute. Documents have been delivered by the applicants to the ACCC by reason of some or all of the Notices. The applicants did not challenge the decision to issue the Notices or the Notices before supplying those documents. Some delay occurred before the applicants brought their applications in this Court. There is no suggestion that any prosecution is intended based upon the Notices and the original time frame for compliance. These would all be reasons for refusing as a matter of discretion the substantive relief sought by the applicants. In view of the above reasons, the applications should be dismissed. I will make orders to facilitate the parties reaching an agreement as to costs. In the event that no agreement is reached, then orders will be made as to the exchange of submissions on the issue of costs.

Case1076,approved,Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608,"notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): Although the notion of a ""market in Australia"" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a ""market in Australia"" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era. In my opinion, Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 was correct in concluding that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products (or services). However, I do not take the reference by Hill J to a global market which includes Australia as arguably a market in Australia 'if sales are made [in Australia]' ([2002] FCA 1608 at [22] ) as making it a requirement that the contract under which services are supplied in Australia must be entered into in Australia or that the transactions themselves must be entered into in Australia. In my view, Hill J was simply proffering an example of how one might identify the possible location of competition, and was not providing a definitive statement that buyers and sellers of services must enter into transactions in Australia."
Case1077,cited,Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53,"Lindgren went on to conclude that the definition of ""market in Australia"" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. As other aspects of the decision in Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 proceeded upon agreed facts, however, that case provides little assistance in determining the other issues raised before me which involved 'a concrete dispute reached after contest in argument': see Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [62] (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ)."
Case1078,cited,S A Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357,"the outset I indicate that 'as a matter of logic and without the necessity to have all of the facts' it may be concluded in any given case that particular conduct is not capable of constituting a contravention of the Act: see S A Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357 at 377 per Wilcox J. Evidence may be admitted to show conclusively that, even without all of the facts, the particular conduct as described in a s 155 notice would not be capable of constituting a contravention of the Act. However, evidence could not be led to show that there is in fact no contravention, assuming the particular conduct as described in a s 155 notice was capable of constituting a contravention of the Act. It is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ). In addition, regard may be had to the identity of, and the knowledge available to, the recipient of the notice: see Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , 189 at [75] (per Sackville and Emmett JJ). The applicants' evidence does not eliminate (as it must) any reasonable hypothesis which is inconsistent with the contention that the market is wholly outside Australia even if one focuses on the inbound services in isolation: see S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 370 and Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 at [9] and [52]. There are many reasons for this, but I provide a non-exhaustive list:"
Case1079,cited,SCAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397,"faith normally involves a lack of an honest or genuine attempt to undertake the statutory function allocated to the decision-maker: see, eg, SCAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397 at [19] per Heerey, Moore and Kiefel JJ. There is a very heavy burden upon any applicant seeking to demonstrate bad faith."
Case1080,followed,Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170,"is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information ""relating"" to one or more ""matters"" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary ""relatedness"" is not to be approached in an ""over-technical or hypercritical way"": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the ""relatedness"" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have ""reason to believe"" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J.

In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. (iv) The word ""matter"" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words ""may constitute"" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not ""idly speculate"" or ""draw on improbable circumstances"" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may ""reasonably be suspected"" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an ""over-technical or hypercritical approach"" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice ""plead"" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370.

It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74 The correct starting point is to determine whether the matters identified in the Notices are incapable, after allowing for undiscovered facts, of constituting a contravention of s 45 of the Act by reference to the deeming provision of s 45A. As noted by Sackville and Emmett JJ in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 '[u]ltimately, the question is whether the matter identified in the Notices ""may constitute"" a contravention of the [Act]' (at 184). The substantial challenge to the decision to issue the Notices, and to the Notices themselves, seized upon this concept of 'matter'; specifically, Emirates argued that the Notices should be set aside because they: relate to, and purport to require [the applicants] to furnish information and produce documents relating to, matters that cannot constitute a contravention of s 45(2) of the [Act] . Those matters concern alleged agreements or understandings relating to the supply of air cargo services on routes into Australia and routes between two or more points outside Australia. Such services are not supplied in competition in a market in Australia. By virtue of s 45(3) and 4E of the [Act] , it is only services supplied in competition in a market in Australia that can possibly found a contravention of s 45(2). Singapore Airlines essentially made the same submission. It was accepted by Emirates and Singapore Airlines that the evidence adduced in these proceedings was not intended to, nor would it enable, the Court to conclude whether all international air cargo services are supplied in a single global market or in many different markets and the boundaries of those markets. It was said by Emirates, at least, that: (a) the Notices allege an arrangement containing provisions that fix the price of international air cargo services supplied by the parties throughout the world; (b) regardless of whether a conclusion is ultimately reached that international air cargo services are supplied in a single global market or many different markets, the supply of those services outside Australia to acquirers outside Australia cannot occur in a market in Australia within the meaning of the Act; (c) in so far as the alleged arrangement contained a provision fixing the price of international air cargo services supplied outside Australia to acquirers outside Australia, it does not satisfy the elements of s 45A; and (d) the conclusion in para (c) holds regardless of whether the parties to the arrangement also supply international air cargo services of the same kind in Australia to acquirers in Australia. It is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ). In addition, regard may be had to the identity of, and the knowledge available to, the recipient of the notice: see Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , 189 at [75] (per Sackville and Emmett JJ). The applicants' evidence does not eliminate (as it must) any reasonable hypothesis which is inconsistent with the contention that the market is wholly outside Australia even if one focuses on the inbound services in isolation: see S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 370 and Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 at [9] and [52]. There are many reasons for this, but I provide a non-exhaustive list:"

It involves fact finding together with evaluative and purposive selection. In any given application it describes a range of economic activities defined by reference to particular economic functions (eg manufacturing, wholesale or retail sales), the class or classes of products, be they goods or services, which are the subject of those activities and the geographic area within which those activities occur. In its statutory setting the market designation imposes, on the activities which it encompasses, limits set by the law for the protection of competition. It involves a choice of the relevant range of activity by reference to economic and commercial realities and the policy of the statute. To the extent that it must serve statutory policy, the identification will be evaluative and purposive as well as descriptive."

Case1083,cited,Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323,"principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: (a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. (b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. (c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J. (d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]). (e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein. (f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J). (g) In Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 136 ALR 453 , Lindgren J said (at 468): It is for an applicant to make out its case of ""failure to take into account"", but the circumstances may be such that the applicant will be aided in this task by an absence of evidence from the decision-maker on a particular matter, such as an absence of evidence giving rise to an inference of a failure to make further inquiries when a genuine taking into account would have called for them."
Case1084,cited,Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (No 2) (1979) 40 FLR 83,"in Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (No 2) (1979) 40 FLR 83 Fisher J said (at 111): The Trade Practices Tribunal considered the concept of market in some detail in Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd (1975-6) 8 ALR 481 at 517, where the members said: ""A market is the area of close competition between firms or, putting it a little differently, the field of rivalry between them. ... Within the bounds of a market there is substitution substitution between one product and another, and between one source of supply and another, in response to changing prices. So a market is the field of actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers amongst whom there can be strong substitution, at least in the long run, if given a sufficient price incentive"". It is significant to note that consideration must be given to both actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers in identifying the 'field of rivalry' between competitors."

Case1086,affirmed,BRGAE of 2006 &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 182,
Case1087,cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1,"mere lack of resources does not of itself give rise to the kind of lack of state protection that is necessary to establish a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. As McHugh J observed in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 at [33] : ' [t] he inability of Australian governments to eliminate [death or serious injury from motor car accidents] does not determine whether the fear [of death or serious injury from a motor accident] is well-founded.' The second ground of appeal concerns whether or not any part of the Tribunal's reasons were based upon information that should have been disclosed to the appellant pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act. Leave is required for the appellant to raise this ground as it was not argued before the Federal Magistrate. It is submitted by the appellant that s 424A(1) of the Act applies in this case in two ways. First, there was a reference in the Tribunal's reasons to country information that had been before the Delegate. The country information included the response of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to a series of questions apparently asked by the Tribunal concerning the status of women trafficking in Mongolia ('the response'). The appellant accepts that if the response was information of a kind to which s 424A(3)(a) of the Act applied it did not need to be disclosed to the appellant. However, the appellant submits that because the response commenced with the words ' SEVERAL FEMALE APPLICANTS CLAIM TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PROTESTING AGAINST WOMEN TRAFFICKING IN MONGOLIA ON BEHALF OF A LOCAL WOMENS SUPPORT GROUP ' (emphasis added), the information must be ' specifically about the applicant or another person ' and not ' just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member ' (s 434A(3)(a)). It is clear to me that when one looks at the response in its totality, the information relates only to a class of persons. All of the answers to the questions and the questions themselves relate to a class of persons, being victims of women trafficking or persons participating in protests against women trafficking, and not to any individual. Accordingly, even if that did form part of the information upon which the Tribunal relied, the Tribunal was not obliged to disclose the response to the appellant."

Case1090,referred to,Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473,"In the appellant's submission, this approach demonstrated that the Tribunal was distracted from the question that is at the heart of any enquiry as to whether a person is a refugee, namely does the person have a well-founded fear of future persecution should that person be returned to their own country. This is the crucial issue and, as Gummow and Hayne JJ have noted, persecution in the past is neither necessary nor sufficient for an affirmative answer to that question. A person could have a well-founded fear of persecution even if there is no likelihood that those responsible for past persecution would be able to mete out similar treatment in the future or even if there had been no persecution in the past; Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [72] - [74] . 30 The Tribunal found that the appellant had a reputation as a troublemaker and that it was likely that this was at the root of his past treatment. That being so it was not sufficient to find that those responsible for that treatment would not seek him out in other parts of Egypt. It was necessary for the Tribunal to ask if the appellant is likely to continue with the conduct that marked him as a troublemaker in the past and, if so, whether that conduct would, in the future, evoke a similar response from others. The Tribunal is not entitled to base its prediction on an expectation that the appellant will modify his behaviour on his return to Egypt; Appellant S395/2002 at [40] per McHugh and Kirby JJ and at [80]-[82] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. 31 The appeal must be allowed with costs. I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone .

Case1091,discussed,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"The Minister urged a 'beneficial' construction of the Tribunal's reasons and referred to comments made in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259, in particular at 271-272. The phrase 'beneficial construction', as used in Wu Shan Liang has a specific meaning, and was certainly not intended to mean that any ambiguity in the Tribunal's reasons be resolved in the Tribunal's favour. Rather, the construction of the Tribunal's reasons should be beneficial in the sense that the Tribunal's reasons would not be over-zealously scrutinised, with an eye attuned to error. In this sense a 'beneficial' approach to the Tribunal's reasons does not require this Court to assume that a vital issue was addressed when there is no evidence of this and, indeed, the general thrust of the Tribunal's comments suggest that the issue was overlooked."
Case1092,applied,"Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437","The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal's conclusion as to relocation was open to it, and that in reaching this conclusion the Tribunal correctly applied the test for relocation: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437. 17 Before discussing the submissions made on appeal, I should mention one puzzling aspect of the Tribunal's reasons, namely the inconsistency between dates of various incidents described by the appellant. The Tribunal records that the appellant gave evidence that he was arrested twice in 2001 (in June and July) and that he left Egypt some four months after the second arrest, that is in late October 2001; however the material in the appeal book shows, and the Tribunal's opening paragraph records, that the appellant arrived in Australia on 25 October 2002 and that his application for a protection visa was lodged on 9 January 2003. There is no suggestion that the appellant came other than directly to Australia. Although the Tribunal mentioned that a psychologist who examined the appellant referred to the appellant's account as being one of detention and torture in 2002 the Tribunal did not dwell on this point and, as mentioned above, the Tribunal specifically stated that it was relying only on the account that the appellant gave at the hearing; see [5] above. 18 The appellant's primary submission in this Court is that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal misapplied the test for relocation, and in doing so made a jurisdictional error. I agree with this submission and, in general, with the submissions made by counsel for the appellant, Mr O'Donnell. 21 It must be emphasised here that it is the prospect of return to the applicant's own country not to a particular part or parts of that country that must be considered; Randhawa at 440. Provided that it is reasonably practicable for the person claiming refugee status to relocate with safety to another part of that country then it cannot be said that the person has a well-founded fear of persecution in that country. In such a case a finding that relocation meets these criteria will be a (or the) critical element in the determination of the application. Irrespective of the Tribunal's scepticism about aspects of the appellant's claims, is clear that the Tribunal's view as to the appellant's ability to relocate within Egypt with comparative ease was a critical element in its decision that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. 22 The Tribunal's consideration of the relocation issue logically raised three separate questions: (a) If the appellant relocated elsewhere in Egypt, would he face persecution from those who had targeted him previously? (b) Had the appellant's persistent campaigning against religious inequalities given him a national profile, such that others in Egypt would persecute him even if he relocated ? (c) If the appellant relocated elsewhere in Egypt, would he continue to engage in campaigns against religious inequality? If so, would this conduct lead others in Egypt (or even just in the area to which he relocated) to persecute him? 23 The Tribunal clearly addressed questions 1 and 2 above and answered them adversely to the appellant. Counsel for the Minister submitted that the third question was effectively answered by the Tribunal's statement: 'He did not suggest that he would attract new harassment by continuing to engage in the same kinds of activity as he had in the past.' 27 The Minister did not accept that the Tribunal had overlooked an essential issue and submitted that the scope of the Tribunal's obligation to consider future persecution of an applicant if relocated is determined by the appellant's claims and the material before the Tribunal. The Minister relied upon the judgment of Black CJ in Randhawa at 443: 'I agree that it would ordinarily be quite wrong for a decision-maker faced with a relocation possibility to take the general approach that there must be a safe haven somewhere without giving the issue more specific attention, but the extent of the decision-maker's task will be largely determined by the case sought to be made out by an applicant .' (emphasis added) 28 In the Minister's submissions much was made of the fact that the relevant conduct of the appellant consisted of letter writing and the Tribunal could not be expected to investigate the possibility of the appellant facing persecution for his letter writing, which is not an activity that one would expect to provoke persecution. This is, with respect, a somewhat disingenuous submission. The appellant was not engaged in writing social letters; the Tribunal described him as embarking on 'a campaign of letter writing' which included letters of complaint to government departments. 29 Here, the questions of whether the appellant would continue his campaign of letter-writing in the future, and whether this conduct would lead to persecution elsewhere in Egypt, necessarily arose on the material before the Tribunal. It was the appellant's letter writing that the Tribunal accepted may have led to his unlawful detention by Giza police for three days. The Tribunal accepted that the appellant may have been beaten during this detention. It is no answer to say that letter writing per se is not an activity that tends to provoke violence the Tribunal had accepted that this was a possibility."
Case1093,cited,Federated Clerks Union of Australia v Victorian Employers Federation [1984] HCA 53 ; (1984) 154 CLR 472,"This interpretation takes too narrow a view of the meaning of the expression industrial conditions. There is nothing in the natural meaning of the expression which would prevent a requirement for union representation being described as an industrial condition. The statutory context suggests that such a requirement would fall within that description. The purpose of s 298K with s 298L(1)(l) is protective, that is to say, it is designed to prevent employees being prejudiced because they are dissatisfied with their working conditions where their union is taking steps to improve those conditions. Viewed this way the claim for union representation in the negotiation of a collective agreement falls within the statutory description. That view is supported by Webb v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1985) 10 IR 252 at 283 where Wilcox J said: ... [a] term such as ""industrial conditions"" should be construed liberally and so as to embrace arrangements for consultation between employer and employee in relation to matters arising out of that relationship and relevant to the working environment of employees, as such. His Honour based that approach on the judgments delivered in Federated Clerks Union of Australia v Victorian Employers Federation [1984] HCA 53 ; (1984) 154 CLR 472 , which held that the wider term ""industrial matters"" included a claim that a union be consulted in relation to technological changes."
Case1094,cited,Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd (1976) 13 ALR 365,"Again it is convenient to approach this ground in a way most favourable to the respondent without determining whether the approach is correct in law. The respondent contended that s 298L(1)(l) required the conditions sought by the union and the conditions about which the applicant employees were dissatisfied to be the same: Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd (1976) 13 ALR 365 at 375. Further, the respondent submitted that this fact was a condition precedent to the application of s 298V and, hence, the onus lay on the applicants to demonstrate the coincidence of conditions. Whilst I doubt that the respondent is correct in this second submission concerning the construction of s 298V, nothing turns on resolution of the issue because, accepting for the purposes of argument the approach proposed by the respondent, the facts of the case do not support the conclusion contended for by it. 115 There was evidence that at all times Mr Whelan pursued the aim of having the respondent negotiate a collective agreement with the union. This is what he told the employees who attended the off site meetings in November and on 1 December 2005. Then, at the union meeting on 9 December 2005 he advocated a role for the union in negotiating an agreement with the respondent. That, he told the meeting, was the way to improve terms and conditions of employment. At the end of the meeting there was a vote in favour of the union negotiating a collective agreement with the respondent, and Mr Whelan initiated a bargaining period immediately following the vote. Mr Thornton acknowledged that Mr Whelan constantly tried to get the respondent to negotiate an agreement with the union. 116 There was evidence that the applicant employees also wanted the respondent to negotiate a collective agreement with the union in order to achieve an improvement in conditions of employment. Mr Kemmis and Mr Coon expressly stated their positions at the meeting on 9 December 2005. Mr Taylor described himself as one of the ""three amigos"" who, together with Mr Kemmis and Mr Coon, were agitating for the respondent to engage with the union to negotiate improved conditions. They were dissatisfied with the situation in which Mr Thornton refused to negotiate with the union."
Case1095,applied,Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298,"On the contrary, the evidence which I accept is that Mr Sathaar, to whom Mr Coon answered, praised Mr Coon for his work on 9 December 2005. Mr Sathaar is still employed by the respondent and was available to give evidence. He was not called. Consequently, the Court is able more confidently to conclude that the evidence of Mr Sathaar would not have assisted the respondent on this question and to accept the evidence of Mr Coon that he was praised for his work on the day: Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 ( Jones v Dunkel ) 47 Then, the evidence of the nature of the failings in Mr Coon's work was unsatisfactory and cast doubt on the accusation that Mr Coon had failed to fulfil his duties. There were a number of allegations made by Mr Thornton against Mr Coon which were so extravagant or so lacking in detail as to make them improbable. There were sufficient occasions of such evidence as to indicate that Mr Thornton's accusations against Mr Coon should not be relied upon. 48 For instance, in [6] of the respondent's contentions filed on 10 July 2007 prior to the hearing and authored by Mr Thornton prior to the respondent securing legal representation, it was said: The second applicant was placed on a dimensional checking role which he performed very poorly and resulted in the respondent shipping incorrect work and receiving rectification costs of approx $250,000. The respondent was served with a notice to produce which sought production of any documents relating to these costs. The respondent produced a credit note dated 30 June 2007, for $50,000 in favour of Monodelphous Pty Ltd. This represented the amount accepted by the respondent for rectification costs of the dispatch of steel on 9 December 2005. When this document was put to Mr Thornton in cross examination he said that he did not mean the contentions to say that Mr Coon was responsible for the whole $250,000 rectification costs. He said that the paragraph was just poorly worded and was prepared by him without assistance. Having regard to the centrality and seriousness of the allegations made, these explanations were, and came across in the witness box as, unconvincing. Further, the credit note came into existence well after the dismissal and could not have been the reason for it. Perhaps sensing these shortcomings Mr Thornton took the opportunity shortly afterwards and following a lunch break to use a question in cross examination as a means to seek to retrieve the situation. The exchange was as follows: Well, you don't point us to any other instance of his alleged poor performance at any time than 9 December, do you?---Yes, well, I will say one thing, which was in relation to this $250,000, point six, which is made on the contentions of fact, saying that we had that he just worked that one day and we made $250,000 worth of errors that day. He didn't, but he was working for about two weeks prior in the beamline as a QO man, effectively letting errors go through, I believe, intentionally. When do you say he was working for two weeks in the beamline as a QO man?---You might need to ask Mr Coon exactly, but I spoke to Mr Sathaar at lunch time. He said, ""No, he worked for about two weeks in the beamline as a like a QO person in the same role."" You went and telephoned Mr Sathaar in the lunch break?---Am I not allowed to do that? Well - - -?---Sorry, I didn't realise that was something I wasn't allowed to do. It was explained to you, I think before the before we broke when we broke for lunch by your counsel that you weren't to be having any discussions over the break, wasn't it?---He said I couldn't talk to him. All right, but you thought you were at liberty to go off and speak to Mr Sathaar to find out the situation?---Well, if you want clarity on what happens, isn't that the best thing? 50 Further, the information was obtained over lunch from Mr Sathaar. Mr Thornton said, in effect, that this was the obvious thing to do because Mr Sathaar had the relevant information. And yet Mr Sathaar was not called to give evidence. He was supervising Mr Coon in the job as quality inspector and was present in the yard when, as Mr Thornton alleged, the errors were found. Mr Sathaar was involved in correcting the errors also. Mr Coon denied each of these facts. Mr Thornton also said that he and Mr Sathaar discussed Mr Coon's unsuitability for the job and the reasons for dismissing Mr Coon at the end of his trial period. It can be concluded from the failure of the respondent to call Mr Sathaar that he would not have assisted the respondent's case on these issues: Jones v Dunkel . 51 Another obstacle faced by the respondent in its argument that Mr Coon caused significant cost to the respondent by failing to inspect the steel in the yard properly was that Mr Thornton said that he, his father, and Mr Sathaar had to do the job which Mr Coon had failed to do. If this were so, and they had done the inspection, one would expect that there would have been no faulty steel dispatched on that day. Consequently, there would have been no rectification costs incurred. When faced with this suggestion in cross examination Mr Thornton responded that: ... I'm not sure we rechecked everything. 52 The lack of certainty expressed in this answer is at odds with Mr Thornton's evidence of his extreme level of anxiety arising from the circumstances of the day which Mr Thornton had previously described. 94 Both Mr Sathaar and Mr Thornton's father could have given evidence as to how far away from the meeting they were standing, whether they were checking steel as Mr Thornton said, and whether the speakers were audible to them. Both men were available to the respondent and are in its camp. Their absence from the witness box leads to the conclusion that their evidence would not have assisted the respondent: Jones v Dunkel . 95 I prefer the evidence of Mr Kemmis, Mr Coon and Mr Taylor that Mr Thornton was no more than 30 metres from the meeting. In particular Mr Taylor had a recollection of the location of the management group by reference to a particular door of the plate work factory. This was a level of detail not found in Mr Thornton's recollection. I also accept the evidence of Mr Taylor that the speakers aimed to have Mr Thornton hear what was said and that it was said loudly for Mr Thornton to hear. 96 I find that the evidence positively establishes that Mr Thornton was present within 30 metres of the meeting for the purpose of observing and listening to what was said. I further find that he heard Mr Coon and Mr Kemmis speak at the meeting in favour of union involvement in negotiating a collective agreement with the respondent, and he observed workers at the meeting vote in favour of this course."
Case1096,applied,Webb v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1985) 10 IR 252,"This interpretation takes too narrow a view of the meaning of the expression industrial conditions.

Case1097,distinguished,Shipley v Masu Financial Management Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 252,"Masu referred to Shipley v Masu Financial Services Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 252 , but that case is distinguishable for two reasons. The first reason is that Hammerschlag J noted (at [49]) that the argument before him appeared to proceed on the basis that Masu was a ""responsible person"" in relation to the Westpoint Products because it was within the notion of ""either the issuer of the financial product or the person making the offer to sell the financial product"". In the present case, however, Mr Stoyef relies exclusively on s 1012A on the basis that Masu provided financial product advice to Mr Stoyef and the group members, that consisted of or included a recommendation that they acquire the Westpoint Products. Accordingly, the only ""responsible person"" in the present case was the issuer of the Westpoint Product relevant to the particular investor, being either Westpoint or a Westpoint entity. The second reason is that the statement of claim in that case pleaded what a ""proper"" PDS of the kind that the defendant or its authorised representatives was required to give to the plaintiffs would have contained. In the present case, the relevant paragraphs of the further amended statement of claim do not use the word ""proper"" to qualify the PDS that was required to be given. 43 .There are, however, in my opinion, two pleading defects which Masu has identified. First, the words ""at least"" in para 42A are objectionable. Mr Curtin of counsel for Masu, submitted that his client is entitled to know now, rather than at trial, what is all of the particular information that Mr Stoyef says would have been included in the PDS which would have altered his and the group members' minds, because his client would like to investigate, or at least may choose to investigate, the question whether that information was known to ""the responsible person"" referred to in s 1013C(2)(a). 44 I agree. The proposed further amended statement of claim should omit the words ""at least"". If Mr Stoyef later wishes to allege that the hypothetical PDS would have contained further information that would have caused him and the group members not to invest, he will need to seek leave to amend further at that time."

In exercising his discretion against the first respondent on this issue, his Honour held at 169: A party against whom an unsustainable claim is prosecuted is not to be forced, at his peril in respect of costs, to abandon every defence he is not sure of maintaining, and oppose to his adversary only the barrier of one hopeful argument: he is entitled to raise his earthworks at every reasonable point along the path of assault. At the same time, if he multiplies issues unreasonably, he may suffer in costs. Ultimately, the question is one of discretion and judgment. In my judgment, the competing considerations will be reflected, and justice will be done, if the costs to be recovered by the first respondent are shorn of any amount attributable to the last day of hearing."

If parties come to realise that they will not necessarily recover the whole of their costs, even though they have unsuccessfully raised a discrete issue, they are likely better to consider whether the raising of that issue is a justifiable course to take. 24 This approach was essentially adopted by Hodgson CJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hodgson CJ, 3 June 1998), where, after discussing the competing considerations of encouraging selectivity of issues and not penalising a party for supporting their case in every reasonable way, his Honour stated at 13: Apart from that consideration, in general terms I accept that if an issue is raised reasonably and is not disproportionate to the whole case, then normally the successful party should get his or her costs. However, particularly in relation to severable issues, the lesser the strength of the point raised and the greater the proportion it bears to the whole case, the more likely it is that the successful party may be deprived of costs; and if the Court comes to the view that it was unreasonable to raise the issue, then the successful party may have to pay the costs of that issue.

These observations were approved by Cooper J (with whom Sheppard and Neaves JJ agreed) in Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 559 at 602-603. 17 Although, I note that Cooper J, in referring to the above passage of Wilcox J, in the decision of Cummings 41 FCR at 603 said: Wilcox J was of the view that to persist in a denial that the statements as found were made was unreasonable and was conduct which unreasonably prolonged the proceedings. It is no answer to say that a party is entitled to test the evidence to show that nothing was said which might amount to the representations as pleaded. A party always has that right in litigation. However, the question which is relevant to the issue as to costs is whether or not the exercise of that right, or the manner in which it was exercised, was reasonable in all the circumstances; and, whether the exercise of the right had the effect of unreasonably prolonging the proceedings. It was this issue which Wilcox J found against the respondents and upon which he based his decision. 18 There must be some element connected to the proceeding to make it fair and reasonable to deprive a successful litigant of its costs. A good reason not to follow the ordinary rule may arise because of the unreasonable or inappropriate conduct of the successful litigant. It may also arise where there is an ability to identify separate issues or inquiries where the successful litigant has failed. 19 There may be other circumstances in which there needs to be some qualification to the starting point of presuming that the successful party is entitled to its costs where justice requires it. Any determination will always depend on the circumstances arising for the decision of the judge who has conducted the trial and who is considering the appropriate order as to costs. 21 The fact that a successful party has lost on a particular issue or inquiry does not necessarily mean that the party has acted in the litigation inappropriately or unreasonably. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, it may be an appropriate exercise of the court's discretion to apportion costs according to success or failure on a particular distinct or severable issue or inquiry irrespective of any inappropriate or unreasonable behaviour on the part of the successful party: see Cummings 41 FCR at 599-604; Hughes [1986] ATPR at 48,136."
Case1104,cited,Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd) v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261,"Considerations of public policy and, in particular, the need for greater economy and efficiency in the conduct of litigation are relevant considerations in the exercise of the discretion when considering whether a successful party is entitled to all its costs: see, e.g. Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd) Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261 at 271-272. 47 It is sometimes preferable after apportioning issues as I have done to avoid leaving the quantification and fixing of costs of those issues to taxation. I am mindful that an allocation of costs in the case of a mixed result can rarely be achieved with mathematical precision and such is not necessary: Dodds 26 IPR at 272 per Gummow, French and Hill JJ. Unfortunately, I do not have any appropriate material to estimate the amount of costs or time spent on the preparation and consideration of the economic test prior to trial, and so cannot make any percentage apportionment of the costs to be discounted. I therefore propose to order a deduction in the costs awarded to the NCC by reference to the NCC's points of defence and amended points of defence which will unfortunately leave the quantification and fixing of costs of the economic test issue to taxation in default of agreement between the relevant parties. 48 Therefore, I propose to order as follows: In proceeding number VID 1641 of 2004: 1.

Case1105,cited,Dr Martens Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602,"The parties were in agreement that I could and should make a global order for costs relating to the proceedings. I am content to proceed on this basis: see Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v Interbulk Ltd (1986) 2 All ER 409 and Dr Martens Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602. 22 As Goldberg J observed in Dr Martens [2000] FCA 602 at [54] : [A] court should be reluctant to embrace the proposition that, as a general rule, it is appropriate to undertake an enquiry as to who was successful in relation to particular issues in a case to determine whether there should be an apportionment of costs against a successful party. A court should not be too ready to disallow costs simply because a party has failed upon an issue, unless it be quite a separate and distinct issue from the issues in respect of which it succeeded or unless there be some element of unreasonableness or inappropriate conduct in relation to that issue: cf Verna Trading Pty Ltd v New India Assurance Pty Ltd [1991] 1 VR 129 at 152-154. 23 It seems appropriate when considering separate and distinct issues or inquiries, where there is no element of unreasonableness or inappropriate behaviour on behalf of the successful litigant, to consider appropriate case management principles, the relative merits or strengths of the lost issue or inquiry, whether the length of the proceedings had been greatly increased by the lost issue or inquiry on which the successful party failed, and whether the issue or inquiry on which the successful party failed otherwise was of sufficient significance in proportion to the whole case to warrant a special order to deprive that party of the costs of that issue."
Case1106,referred to,Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (1999) 164 ALR 203,"It is significant to recall that all parties needed to confront the principal question in the proceedings on the basis there existed only one previous decision of the Court that of Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (1999) 164 ALR 203 (' Hamersley ') which dealt with the interpretation of the term ""use of a production process"" within s 44B of the Act and which involved a very similar factual scenario to the proceedings. Fortescue's principal contention was that, applying the ""marketable commodity"" test to the factual scenario as contended for by Fortescue, a ""marketable commodity"" was produced in BHPBIO's operations before the iron ore was railed to the port. As an alternative contention, Fortescue sought to distinguish Hamersley on a number of grounds. 30 BHPBIO had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately. Nevertheless, BHPBIO was the losing party, and Fortescue would ordinarily be entitled to its costs. However, despite Fortescue's ultimate success in the proceedings, I did not find in favour of Fortescue on certain factual and legal issues or inquiries. Nevertheless, I do not consider it appropriate in the circumstances to disentitle Fortescue to its whole costs in the proceedings. 31 The conduct of Fortescue in this proceeding was neither inappropriate nor unreasonable. Fortescue structured its case primarily on the basis of the correctness of the decision in Hamersley . Therefore, it seems to me that seeking to apply the ""marketable commodity"" test as expounded in that decision was an entirely appropriate and reasonable approach. Further, it seems to me that Fortescue seeking in the alternative to distinguish the Hamersley decision on a number of grounds was similarly appropriate and reasonable. In addition, I do not see any inappropriate or unreasonable behaviour on the part of Fortescue in its approach to putting BHPBIO to proof on factual matters or contentions. The Court accepted in essence the actual process and operations as contended for by BHPBIO. However, the conclusions of the Court were determined objectively and not by reference to BHPBIO's own subjective views or characterisations, or by reference to the subjective views or characterisations of the witnesses called on behalf of BHPBIO. Fortescue was entitled to test the evidence put forward by BHPBIO, especially in respect of such subjective views and characterisations. 32 In Hamersley , the learned trial judge held the term ""production process"" meant ""a series of operations by which a marketable commodity is created or manufactured"": at 213. The test required, as a question of ""fact and degree"", a consideration of ""the actual operation of the activities in question, considered as a whole"": at 213. The evidence as to ""marketable commodity"", whilst it may be separately identified, was all part of the material the Court needed to consider in determining the actual operation of the activities in question. Accordingly, it does not seem unreasonable for Fortescue to have approached in the way it did the material placed before the Court. The principal question for determination in the proceedings was not a mere matter of statutory interpretation of the term ""the use of a production process"" that could be dealt with by demurrer. Rather, the Court was required to consider, in detail, the factual evidence of BHPBIO's operations and apply the construction of the term ""the use of a production process"", whether that construction be the one set out in Hamersley , or the construction for which the Court ultimately found. There does not seem to me to be any element of unreasonableness or inappropriateness in Fortescue directing its evidence, submissions and cross-examination to the application of that test to the facts of this case. 33 This is not the end of the inquiry. As I have indicated, the exercise of the discretion to make an order as to costs is not just limited to a consideration of the reasonableness or appropriateness of the conduct of a party in connection with the proceedings. It may also be appropriate to discount an order in favour of a successful litigant in circumstances where it has lost certain issues or inquiries which can clearly be treated as distinct and severable. 34 At the outset, I do not consider that the matters upon which Fortescue was unsuccessful were relevantly distinct or severable although they can be identified. Rather, the matters on which Fortescue was unsuccessful were alternative arguments in support of the one principal question in the proceedings, that is, whether either of the relevant services was a ""service"" within the meaning of s 44B of the Act. The matters raised by Fortescue were sufficiently linked to this principal question in the proceedings. Fortescue did not seek to raise a separate matter for determination by way of a positive defence. 35 However, to the extent the issues or inquiries upon which Fortescue lost can be identified, and even if they be relevantly distinct and severable, in my view, none of the matters sought to be addressed by Fortescue were so disproportionate to the whole case, or so lacked merit, or so adversely impacted upon the economy and efficiency of the proceedings, according to case management principles, as to warrant an order to deprive Fortescue of some or all of its costs. As I have said, I was required to consider in detail the factual evidence and apply that evidence to the construction of the term ""use of a production process"", which Fortescue reasonably contested. The ultimate ends of justice would not be served by Fortescue not recovering its costs because of its failure on some identifiable (or even distinct and severable) issues or inquiries, when those issues or inquiries needed to be canvassed as being material to the reaching of a decision."
Case1107,applied,Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [1999] FCA 1078,"In Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [1999] FCA 1078 , Kenny J considered the apportionment of costs and reduced the costs awarded to the successful applicant to reflect, amongst other things, costs associated with certain affidavit evidence ruled to be inadmissible. 44 Similarly, here, a reduction of costs awarded to NCC would be appropriate in view of my rejection of the economic test. This was an issue which could be treated as clearly distinct and severable, it being in effect a positive contention raised by the NCC in its points of defence and amended points of defence, which had little merit and did add to the costs of preparation of the parties for trial. Whilst I do not have sufficient material to assess such costs, I am satisfied they are not merely minimal. 45 Professor Rey (the economic expert called on behalf of the NCC) and the other economic experts before me agreed that the term ""production process"" had no technical or specialised meaning in economics. In these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the economic test could be relevant to the contention that Hamersley was wrongly decided or could provide an appropriate replacement test."

Case1114,cited,Roberts v Rodier [2006] NSWSC 1084,"I should interpolate that there may not need to be the ability to precisely identify separate costs in respect of particular issues. As Campbell J said in Roberts v Rodier [2006] NSWSC 1084 at [33] : ... I do not accept that the appropriate way of exercising the costs discretion is limited to the identification of separate costs of particular issues. It could sometimes be within the scope of a proper exercise of discretion, where the costs of certain evidence was relevant to issues on which a plaintiff succeeded and also to issues on which the plaintiff failed, to decide to allow the plaintiff a proportion only of those costs. 26 Whilst the cases referred to above throw light on the relevant principles to be applied in the exercise of the discretion, their application to the facts of a particular case is sometimes difficult when competing considerations apply. 27 As I understand the principles relevant to my task, they can be summarised as follows: 1. A successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to its costs even if the losing party had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately; 2. The successful litigant will be so entitled to its costs unless some good reason connected to the case is shown to the contrary; 3. Without limiting the general discretion available, a good reason to the contrary may arise: 3.1 Where the conduct of the successful litigant in connection with the case was unreasonable or inappropriate; 3.2 Where no such unreasonable or inappropriate conduct of the successful litigant is found, but nevertheless there were clearly distinct and severable issues or inquiries that were lost by the successful litigant; 4. If the conduct of a successful litigant was inappropriate or unreasonable in connection with the case, the successful litigant will usually be denied all or part of its costs; 5. Where the court is considering the question of costs in respect of a lost distinct or severable issue or inquiry, which can clearly be treated as distinct and severable, then to determine whether the successful party will lose some or all of its costs, it will be necessary to consider and weigh up case management principles, the significance of the issue or inquiry in proportion to the proceeding as a whole, and whether the issue or inquiry had any relative strength or merit; 6. The court has the discretion to apportion costs even if it cannot identify separate costs in respect of distinct or severable issues or inquiries on which the successful litigant failed, but the matters on which the party failed must be at least capable of separation from the matters on which the litigant was successful."
Case1115,cited,Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229,"The power of the Court to make orders for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). As a general rule, the successful litigant in a proceeding is entitled to receive its costs ordinarily, costs follow the event. The power to order costs is discretionary, although it must be exercised judicially and not against the successful party except for some good reason connected with the case: Milne v Attorney-General for the State of Tasmania [1956] HCA 48 ; (1956) 95 CLR 460 at 477; Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234; and Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 11 per Bray CJ. It is well established that the discretion conferred on the Court is very wide, and enables the Court to respond to the wide variety of circumstances that may arise in relation to the making of costs orders. 14 The ordinary rule applies even though the losing party may have had good legal grounds for its stance and conducted itself reasonably and appropriately: see Ruddock 115 FCR at 235. In exercising its discretion, the court is looking at the matter primarily from the perspective of the successful litigant: see Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 542-3 per Mason CJ; 564 per McHugh J. 20 However, it is to be observed that ordinarily a discount is applied, or said to apply, because of the inappropriate or unreasonable conduct of the successful party: see Ruddock 115 FCR at 236-237 and Latoudis 170 CLR at 544 per Mason CJ; 565-566 per Toohey J."
Case1116,applied,Health &amp; Life Care Ltd v SA Asset Management Corp [1995] SASC 5514 ; (1995) 18 ACSR 153,"In Health &amp; Life Care Ltd v SA Asset Management Corp [1995] SASC 5514 ; (1995) 18 ACSR 153 , the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia dealt with the question of construction of reg 5.6.24 and the principles of election relating to the surrender of a security by a secured creditor. Doyle CJ (with whom Duggan and Nyland JJ agreed) said at 158 that: ...reg 5.6.24(3) refers to a creditor who has voted in respect of his or her whole debt or claim...When a vote is taken on the voices or by a show of hands each creditor who votes does so simply in the capacity of a creditor. The Chief Justice went on to say that in his opinion: ...it cannot be said that a creditor who votes on the voices (or by a show of hands) votes in respect of the value of the debt or claim. 20 It is plain on the evidence before me that this is what occurred in the present case. It follows from what Doyle CJ said that the provisions of reg 5.6.24(3) were not enlivened. This regulation contains a statement of one situation in which a secured creditor is deemed to have surrendered his or her security. However, as I have said, that provision is not enlivened in the present case and it is unnecessary to further consider this issue. 22 Doyle CJ in Health &amp; Life Care went on at 162 to explain the relationship between reg 5.6.24 and the provisions of s 554E of the Act.

Case1118,distinguished,Sargent v ASL Developments Limited [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634,"On 16 May, during the course of oral argument, counsel appearing for the liquidator of Kelso raised the possibility that the actions of Provident may be seen to amount to an unequivocal election to surrender its security pursuant to s 554E of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Sargent v ASL Developments Limited [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634. 4 I will set out the relevant legislative provisions which are as follows: Section 554E Proof of debt by secured creditor (1) In the winding up of an insolvent company, a secured creditor is not entitled to prove the whole or a part of the secured debt otherwise than in accordance with this section and with any other provisions of this Act or the regulations that are applicable to proving the debt. (2) The creditor's proof of debt must be in writing. (3) If the creditor surrenders the security to the liquidator for the benefit of creditors generally, the creditor may prove for the whole of the amount of the secured debt. (4) If the creditor realises the security, the creditor may prove for any balance due after deducting the net amount realised, unless the liquidator is not satisfied that the realisation has been effected in good faith and in a proper manner. (5) If the creditor has not realised or surrendered the security, the creditor may: (a) estimate its value; and (b) prove for the balance due after deducting the value so estimated. (6) If subsection (5) applies, the proof of debt must include particulars of the security and the creditor's estimate of its value. Regulation 5.6.24 Votes of secured creditors (1) For the purposes of voting, a secured creditor must state in the creditor's proof of debt or claim: (a) the particulars of his or her security; and (b) the date when it was given; and (c) the creditor's estimate of the value of the security; unless he or she surrenders the security. (2) A creditor is entitled to vote only in respect of the balance, if any, due to him or her after deducting the value of his or her security as estimated by him or her in accordance with regulation 5.6.41. (3) If a secured creditor votes in respect of his or her whole debt or claim, the creditor must be taken to have surrendered his or her security unless the Court on application is satisfied that the omission to value the security has arisen from inadvertence. (4) This regulation does not apply to: (a) a meeting of creditors convened under Part 5.3A of the Act; or (b) a meeting held under a deed of company arrangement. 5 The facts may be stated briefly. Provident entered into a deed of charge with Kelso on 2 August 2001. The charge is a fixed and floating charge and was registered on 9 August 2001. Kelso owned a factory and land situated at Wentworthville. That property was subject to Provident's charge. 22 Doyle CJ in Health &amp; Life Care went on at 162 to explain the relationship between reg 5.6.24 and the provisions of s 554E of the Act. It is evident that even if the provisions of the regulations are not applicable, there may nonetheless amount to conduct on the part of a secured creditor which would constitute an election within the principles stated in Sargent v ASL . 24 Dutney J referred to the well-know statement of principle of Stephen J in Sargent v ASL where Stephen J observed that: The words or conduct ordinarily required to constitute an election must be unequivocal in the sense that [the words or conduct are] consistent only with the exercise of one of the two sets of rights and inconsistent with the exercise of the other. Stephen JA also observed that there may be less unequivocal conduct which may provide some evidence of an election and that this may be sufficient if it is coupled with actual knowledge of the right of election. 26 The effect of the reasoning in Surfers Paradise Investments seems to be that something more than the mere submission of the proof of debt is required to constitute an election in the sense referred to in Sargent v ASL . In Surfers Paradise Investments the Queensland Court of Appeal was of the view that there was an election because the receipt of the dividend cheque was unequivocal. At that point in time, as Dutney J observed at [37], the respondent was required to make a choice between accepting the cheque or returning it to the liquidator. The assertion of a right to retain the dividend evidenced by banking the cheque and retaining the proceeds was sufficient to constitute unequivocal conduct amounting to an election."

In that case the respondent was a secured creditor who lodged a proof of debt for the full amount of the debt, disclosing a mortgage, but attributing no value to it. Subsequently the secured creditor received from the liquidator a dividend cheque which it banked and retained. The dividend was calculated on that basis of the full amount of the appellant's total indebtedness. The lead judgment was delivered by Dutney J, but there is also a useful statement of the applicable principles in the judgment of Williams JA. (Jerrard JA agreed with both Williams JA and Dutney J). 26 The effect of the reasoning in Surfers Paradise Investments seems to be that something more than the mere submission of the proof of debt is required to constitute an election in the sense referred to in Sargent v ASL .

While construction of any legislation undoubtedly raises legal issues, advancing as propositions for the court ""the proper construction and operation"" of a either a section of an Act (question of law 1 in the notice of appeal) or a phrase (questions of law 5 and 6 in the notice of appeal) do not, without more, present questions which the Court can properly consider. This is not a case where a question of law has been inelegantly drafted but nonetheless is a question the purport of which is tolerably clear ( Ergon Energy Corporation Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 125 at [51] ) - questions 1, 5 and 6 simply do not raise questions . 17 However, questions 2, 3 and 4 do raise questions, which can be characterised as questions of law.

Case1127,distinguished,"Kear v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] 1087 FCA","In summary, the applicant submits that the AAT misapplied the term ""own use or benefit"" within the context of s 8(1). In particular: &#8226; The phrase does not call for an assessment as to whether a person can in fact use the earnings as they wish or benefit from the earnings in an absolute sense. &#8226; The fact that the money may be earmarked to meet a particular obligation does not detract from the fact that the money is for the person's own use or benefit: Kear v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] 1087 FCA. &#8226; The fact that the repayments were made in respect of tasks performed by the respondent and made to the same entity who paid her wages seems to have clouded the issue. The situation is analogous to an employee who is found liable to the employer for damages for negligence arising out of the employee's actions in the workplace: even if the damages awarded were deducted from wages of the employee it could not be said that the employee's earnings were the lesser sum after the deduction of the damages award. &#8226; The circumstances surrounding the payment by the respondent and later reimbursement of $1,300 highlights the error in the AAT's approach. &#8226; The AAT appears to have been influenced by the fact that the applicant was unable to identify a benefit to the respondent from the amounts of the shortfalls. This is clearly an irrelevant consideration as the Act provides for the alternative of ""use or benefit"". The respondent in this case clearly used the amounts to meet her obligations. In any event the respondent did benefit from such amounts in that her superannuation entitlements were calculated on the basis of her gross earnings without deduction for the shortfalls as was apparent from the Employee Payment Summary provided by her employer. 14 In summary, the respondent submitted: 1. So-called questions of law 1, 5 and 6 specified in the notice of appeal are not, in fact, questions of law. 2. The AAT correctly recognised that the key question is whether the whole of the respondent's nominal gross wages can be said to be ""income"" as that term is defined for the purposes of s 8 of the Act . Expressed alternatively, could the amount of the withheld shortfall be said to be earned, derived or received by her for her own use or benefit? 3. The phrase ""for the person's own use or benefit"" entails the notion of a person being able to use property or income as the person wishes or sees fit, as opposed to being obliged to apply the property or income in a particular way. The respondent was never able, at the time of earning, derivation or (constructive) receipt to use the whole of her nominal gross wage as she wished or saw fit. Rather, to the extent of any shortfall, her employer was contractually entitled to withhold the amount of that shortfall from that gross wage and the respondent was obliged to accept that such an amount could be so withheld. 4. The words ""without any reduction"" which appear in s 1072 of the Act qualify only ""income"" as defined, namely the income earned, derived or received for the person's own use or benefit . 5. Reference by the applicant to the sum of $1,300 later received by the respondent by way of refund from her employer is a distraction as the appeal is unconcerned with that sum, although it will be relevant in any recalculation by the applicant of the amount, if any, of any overpayment of benefit. In any event, the AAT correctly regarded that sum as ""ordinary income"" for the purposes of the Act . 15 Appeals from the AAT are not appeals in the strict sense as they lie within the original jurisdiction of the Court. A party to a proceeding before the AAT may appeal to the Court from any decision of the AAT in that proceeding, but only on questions of law: s 44(1) Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). 47 It is for the same reason that I find distinguishable from these facts the decision in Kear [1998] 1087 FCA where Heerey J held that the relevant money received by the applicant in that case was ""his own money to deal with as he saw fit"" notwithstanding that the applicant had other commitments or arrangements for which that money was earmarked."
Case1128,distinguished,Marsh v Secretary to the Department of Social Security (1986) 12 FCR 100,"Similarly, the facts of the case before me may be contrasted with those in Marsh v Secretary to the Department of Social Security (1986) 12 FCR 100 where, in finding that a training allowance paid to a part-time trainee was ""income"" within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth), Burchett J said at 104: ""The whole of it was paid, so far as appears, not on condition that he expended any part of it upon a purpose associated with his part-time training, but to assist in his support whilst he was undergoing that training. How he chose to organize his life and expenditure during the period of the part-time course was entirely a matter for him... One can readily imagine a case of an allowance entitlement to receive which was dependent upon its expenditure for specified purposes, unrelated to the ordinary incidents of life, so as to entail the conclusion that either the whole of it, or some proportion of it, could not fairly be regarded as a net receipt 'for his own use and benefit' , within the meaning which the Full Court in Haldane-Stevenson's case ascribed to the definition..."" (emphasis added) 46 A strong analogy can be drawn between the case before me and the case hypothesised by Burchett J in Marsh 12 FCR 100 - namely circumstances where income received is subject to the requirement of expenditure for certain purposes. The facts before me however may be distinguished from those in Marsh 12 FCR 100 where the manner in which the relevant employee spent his training allowance was a matter of choice for him."

Case1131,cited,Read v Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57,"The AAT affirmed the decision of the SSAT. Deputy President Hack in the AAT identified the key issue as whether a contractual obligation on the part of an employee to make good till shortfalls should be taken into account in determining the employee's income from that employment. It is useful to set out in full relevant observations from the AAT decision: ""[19] As it seems to me, the critical issue for determination is whether Ms Richards ordinary income was the nominal amount calculated by reference to a number of hours at an hourly rate or the actual rate that is the nominal amount less any shortfall that Ms Richards had to make good. In my view the employment contract between Ms Richards and the Hotel was one where Ms Richards' wages were determined by reference to three factors - the number of hours worked in a week, an hourly rate and any till shortages. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether it was lawful for the employer to oblige Ms Richards to make good the shortfall, rather the question is whether in circumstances where she did make good the shortfall her gross ordinary income was the nominal amount or the actual amount. [20] In Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1997) 81 FCR 35 at page 42 French J said, ""The definitions of 'income' and 'income amount' in the Social Security Act indicate that like their statutory predecessors they are of wide application. This meets the public policy requirement that 'public expenditure is directed to those who stand in actual need of the periodic support which income-related pensions provide' - Read v Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57 at 69 (Brennan J)."" His Honour went on to make the point that the concept of income in the Act is entirely different from that embodied in the comparable provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 . ... [21] At pages 43-44 his Honour said, ""The definition of 'income' extends to income amounts 'received' by a person. There is no requirement in the Act that such amounts are received in exchange for anything. They may therefore extend to gifts. This is reinforced by the extension of the definition of 'income' to 'a periodical payment by way of gift or allowance.' There is no requirement in the definition for the payment received to constitute a net gain. Absent such a requirement a payment of money received by a person for that person's own use or benefit is a payment of an income amount."" [22] In my view the key to the present issue is to ask whether the amounts that went to making up the shortfall in the till were amounts that were received to Ms Richards' own use or benefit. That is so I consider because the definition of gross ordinary income in s 1072 of the Act incorporates the s 8 definition of income relevantly an amount earned, derived or received by a person for the person's own use or benefit. Thus s 1072 looks at income earned, derived or received for the use or benefit of the person in issue. It is in my view not to the point that s 1072 goes on to speak of 'without any reduction.' To treat the amounts of shortfall in this way simply recognises the reality that those sums were not received by Ms Richards for her own use or benefit. There was at best a nominal receipt but given that Ms Richards used those sums to satisfy her contractual obligation to make good shortfalls it could not be said that in any real sense she earned, derived or received those sums or that she had the use or benefit of them. [23] The Secretary was unable to identify any benefit to Ms Richards from these amounts beyond the benefit of retaining her employment. I do not think, with respect, that that could be seen as a benefit of the type contemplated by the definition of income in s 8. [24] It follows that in my view the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal was correct and ought to be affirmed."" 32 Third, the concept of ""income"" under the Act is broad. As Brennan J observed in Read v The Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57 at 69 in relation to the definition of ""income"" under the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth) (which in the context of the proceedings before me is not materially different to the definition of income in s 8 of the Act): ""The definition is exhaustive: the term 'income' means what it is defined to mean; it does not mean what 'income' would be understood to mean if the definition were not in the Act. The definition is couched in the widest terms, presumably to ensure that public expenditure is directed to those who stand in actual need of the periodic support which income-related pensions provide."" (I note that Brennan J was in dissent in his judgment in Read [1988] HCA 26 ; 167 CLR 57. However, like Foster J in Secretary to the Department of Social Security v Cuneen [1997] 1033 FCA, I do not read the other judgments in Read [1988] HCA 26 ; 167 CLR 57 as differing from Brennan J's construction of the meaning of ""income""). 34 In relation to the concept of income being ""earned, derived or received"", it is clear that: &#8226; the use of the verbs ""earned"", ""derived"" and ""received"" in juxtaposition in the definition of ""income"" in the Act suggests that each was intended to have a different meaning: Sheppard J in Inguanti v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1988) 80 ALR 307 at 311 &#8226; income cannot be ""earned, derived or received"" unless it is also realised: Read 167 CLR per Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ at 67 &#8226; income can be realised - and hence received - even if temporarily it is not accessible: Rose 21 FCR at 245 &#8226; income can be ""derived"" within the meaning of s 8(1) even if it is not at that time received ( Inguanti 80 ALR at 311) &#8226; ""earned"" relates to personal earnings and profits ( Inguanti 80 ALR at 310). 44 Fifth, in interpreting the phrase ""own use or benefit"" it is clear that the obligation of the respondent in this case can be contrasted, for example, with payments made by a person as a result of arrangements otherwise within his or her control, such as outgoings on residential properties of the person which constitute an expense in generating rental income on those properties. As pointed out by the Full Court in Garvey 22 FCR at 136 in relation to such circumstances, ""It was not the purpose of the Act to provide a further source of income for a person who had applied his or her income to maintain a business conducted at a loss or upon outgoings incurred in acquiring or maintaining assets.

Case1135,considered,"Secretary, Department of Social Security v Garvey (1989) 22 FCR 132","Fourth, it is important to note that the concept of ""income"" under the Act is not to be equated with ""income"" under income tax legislation: Haldane-Stevenson v Director-General of Social Services (1985) 9 FCR 73 per McGregor and Pincus JJ at 75 and Davies J at 80. It is an act which provides for income maintenance : Davies J in Haldane-Stevenson 9 FCR at 80; Morling, Hartigan and Lee JJ in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Garvey (1989) 22 FCR 132 at 136; cf comments of O'Loughlin J in Barry v Repatriation Commission (1993) 41 FCR 529 at 532.

Contrary to the submissions of the applicant, I do not find the reporting by the Hotel for superannuation purposes helpful in this context. Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin"
Case1136,distinguished,"Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1997) 81 FCR 35","The AAT affirmed the decision of the SSAT. Deputy President Hack in the AAT identified the key issue as whether a contractual obligation on the part of an employee to make good till shortfalls should be taken into account in determining the employee's income from that employment. It is useful to set out in full relevant observations from the AAT decision: ""[19] As it seems to me, the critical issue for determination is whether Ms Richards ordinary income was the nominal amount calculated by reference to a number of hours at an hourly rate or the actual rate that is the nominal amount less any shortfall that Ms Richards had to make good. In my view the employment contract between Ms Richards and the Hotel was one where Ms Richards' wages were determined by reference to three factors - the number of hours worked in a week, an hourly rate and any till shortages. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether it was lawful for the employer to oblige Ms Richards to make good the shortfall, rather the question is whether in circumstances where she did make good the shortfall her gross ordinary income was the nominal amount or the actual amount. [20] In Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1997) 81 FCR 35 at page 42 French J said, ""The definitions of 'income' and 'income amount' in the Social Security Act indicate that like their statutory predecessors they are of wide application. This meets the public policy requirement that 'public expenditure is directed to those who stand in actual need of the periodic support which income-related pensions provide' - Read v Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57 at 69 (Brennan J)."" His Honour went on to make the point that the concept of income in the Act is entirely different from that embodied in the comparable provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 . ... [21] At pages 43-44 his Honour said, ""The definition of 'income' extends to income amounts 'received' by a person. There is no requirement in the Act that such amounts are received in exchange for anything. They may therefore extend to gifts. This is reinforced by the extension of the definition of 'income' to 'a periodical payment by way of gift or allowance.' There is no requirement in the definition for the payment received to constitute a net gain. Absent such a requirement a payment of money received by a person for that person's own use or benefit is a payment of an income amount."" [22] In my view the key to the present issue is to ask whether the amounts that went to making up the shortfall in the till were amounts that were received to Ms Richards' own use or benefit. That is so I consider because the definition of gross ordinary income in s 1072 of the Act incorporates the s 8 definition of income relevantly an amount earned, derived or received by a person for the person's own use or benefit. Thus s 1072 looks at income earned, derived or received for the use or benefit of the person in issue. It is in my view not to the point that s 1072 goes on to speak of 'without any reduction.' To treat the amounts of shortfall in this way simply recognises the reality that those sums were not received by Ms Richards for her own use or benefit. There was at best a nominal receipt but given that Ms Richards used those sums to satisfy her contractual obligation to make good shortfalls it could not be said that in any real sense she earned, derived or received those sums or that she had the use or benefit of them. [23] The Secretary was unable to identify any benefit to Ms Richards from these amounts beyond the benefit of retaining her employment. I do not think, with respect, that that could be seen as a benefit of the type contemplated by the definition of income in s 8. [24] It follows that in my view the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal was correct and ought to be affirmed."" 48 Finally, in my view a construction of the phrase which would characterise moneys required to be repaid to the employer as being for the employee's ""own use and benefit"" is at odds with the purpose of the Act to maintain a basic level of income for those who are unable to receive sufficient income to provide for themselves ( Garvey 22 FCR at 136, Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1998) 81 FCR 35 at 42). Such an arrangement means that the money paid by the employee to the employer is not actually usable by the employee as income, and cannot be taken into consideration in any realistic way in maintaining a basic level of income for the employee. Contrary to the submissions of the applicant, I do not find the reporting by the Hotel for superannuation purposes helpful in this context. Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin 49 The applicant relied in its submissions on the decision of French J in McLaughlin 81 FCR 35. In that case the respondents, who had carried on business as milk vendors for a number of years, received $121,950 from the Western Australian Dairy Industry Authority under an industry deregulation scheme, in consideration for an undertaking of the respondents to have no involvement in the milk distribution or milk vending businesses in Western Australia for three years. The AAT found on the facts that the arrangement was for the Authority to pay the principal sum to the respondents without any intention that the respondents repay the money, but subject to a contractual term in the event of a breach of covenant giving the Authority the discretion to recover a similar amount. French J held that the amounts received by the respondents were ""income"" within the Act, notwithstanding that they had been not been received in exchange for anything; further his Honour accepted that the amounts had been received for the respondents' own use or benefit (at 44). However in my view the facts of the case before me are distinguishable from McLaughlin 81 FCR 35, in that: &#8226; whereas the income in fact earned, derived or received by the respondent in these proceedings was determined by reference to, inter alia , till shortfalls - &#8226; in McLaughlin 81 FCR 35 the power of the Authority to demand repayment of the amount paid to the respondents would appear to have required a determination that there had in fact been a breach of a term of the contract by the respondents; further the terms of the agreement between the Authority and the respondent stated that, if the Authority did not seek repayment by the respondents before a certain time, the respondents were not liable to repay any amounts paid by the Authority. Other than the provision with respect to possible breach of contract, there appeared to be no limitation on the entitlement of the respondents to deal with the moneys paid by the Authority as they chose. 50 In identifying whether amounts received are for the ""own use and benefit"" of the recipient, there is in my view a substantial difference between: &#8226; the obligation of the respondent to ""make good"" till shortfalls (however incurred) arising in the course of her employment, which in turn determines the income of the respondent, as was the case here, and &#8226; the contractual power of the Authority in McLaughlin 81 FCR 35 to demand repayment of paid amounts being limited to a period of time, and dependent upon a breach by the respondents of any terms of the agreement, but which power depended upon identification of such ""breach"" having taken place as a matter of contract law. 51 Accordingly, contrary to the submissions of the applicant I do not find the decision in McLaughlin 81 FCR 35 helpful in identifying whether moneys received by respondent in the case before me were for her ""own use and benefit"". $1,300 TAB till shortfall 52 The applicant also submitted that the circumstances surrounding the repayment by the respondent to the Hotel of a till shortfall of $1,300 and subsequent reimbursement of that sum by the Hotel highlights the error in the Tribunal's approach. However in my view it is clear that if moneys representing TAB till shortfalls are paid by the employee to the employer, but subsequently refunded to the employee - as occurred in relation to the $1,300 the subject of the fraud perpetrated on the Hotel - it is at the point they are refunded to the employee that they become income amounts for the own use and benefit of the employee. In those circumstances where the employee is in receipt of Centrelink benefits the employee at that point is required to advise Centrelink of the receipt of that income, because it is only at that point that the money becomes income for the employee's ""own use and benefit"" within the meaning of the Act. I find no error in the reasoning of Deputy President Hack in relation to this issue. 53 In light of my findings in this case the appropriate order is that the appeal be dismissed. I certify that the preceding fifty-three (53) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

Case1138,cited,Secretary to the Department of Social Security v Cuneen [1997] 1033 FCA,"Third, the concept of ""income"" under the Act is broad. As Brennan J observed in Read v The Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57 at 69 in relation to the definition of ""income"" under the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth) (which in the context of the proceedings before me is not materially different to the definition of income in s 8 of the Act): ""The definition is exhaustive: the term 'income' means what it is defined to mean; it does not mean what 'income' would be understood to mean if the definition were not in the Act. The definition is couched in the widest terms, presumably to ensure that public expenditure is directed to those who stand in actual need of the periodic support which income-related pensions provide."" (I note that Brennan J was in dissent in his judgment in Read [1988] HCA 26 ; 167 CLR 57. However, like Foster J in Secretary to the Department of Social Security v Cuneen [1997] 1033 FCA, I do not read the other judgments in Read [1988] HCA 26 ; 167 CLR 57 as differing from Brennan J's construction of the meaning of ""income"")."
Case1139,cited,"Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415","The applicant submitted that the AAT had erred in ignoring the words ""gross"" and ""from all sources"", and had (in error) focused in isolation on the s 8(1) definition of ""income"". However no error was demonstrated by the AAT's approach. As I have held, the threshold issue in relation to identifying ordinary income is determining whether it is actually "" income "" within the meaning of the Act . Once income is identified, ordinary income can be calculated in accordance with s 1072 by reference to the gross income from all sources for the relevant period without reduction other than reduction under Div 1A of the Act . Expressed another way, the adjective ""gross"" applies to income once it is identified as income. An example of the application of this principle is in Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415 where Finn J considered whether payments received by the applicant in that case under an income protection policy bore the character of ordinary income of the applicant's business so as to allow the reduction for losses and outgoings permitted by Div 1A. In that case his Honour, correctly in my opinion, accepted the submissions of the parties that the relevant moneys in that case were ""income"" within the meaning of the Act . Similarly in this case, the first question is whether the moneys received in this case, in particular the moneys repaid by the respondent to the applicant, actually constitute ""income"" within the meaning of s 8(1). 28 This question was clearly viewed by the SSAT and the AAT as the key issue in this case. Indeed in considering whether the respondent's ordinary income included these sums, the question may be recharacterised as whether the sums subsequently repaid by the respondent to the Hotel in respect of TAB till shortfalls constituted income amounts earned, derived or received by the respondent for her own use or benefit. In this respect, as I indicated earlier in this judgment, this question subsumes question of law 4 posed by the applicant, and I will consider both questions of law 3 and 4 together. ""Income"" under the Act : general principles 29 In considering the meaning of ""income"" as defined by the Act , a number of propositions are clear."

Case1144,followed,Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148,"In his Reasons for Judgment, at [13] (p 218), Gleeson CJ expressly approved the following passage from the Reasons for Judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153: In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. 25 The remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; 161 CLR 148 require Sebel to show that: (a) it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (b) the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. 26 The first of these matters involves an assessment by the Court as to whether the claimant would, in all material respects, be in as good a position if he were confined to his damages remedy, as he would be in if an injunction were granted (see the discussion of this aspect in Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies , 7th edn, 2007 at pp 383 389; at pp 397 399; and at pp 457 462). 27 The second of these matters requires the Court to exercise a discretion."
Case1145,followed,Conagra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302,"The tort of passing off is notoriously difficult to define. A Full Court of this Court in Conagra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 explained the history, meaning and current relevance of the tort. At 355.8 356.2, Gummow J said: In Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc [1990] UKHL 12 ; [1990] RPC 341 at 406, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton formulated the essential elements in a passing-off action without referring specifically to earlier authority. Now, Nourse LJ (in Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v Marks and Spencer plc [1991] RPC 351 at 368-369) has said that the formulations by Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser had not in his experience given the same degree of assistance in analysis and decision as ""the classical trinity"" of (1) reputation (2) misrepresentation and (3) damage. Nourse LJ regards what was said in the Borden case (supra) as signalling a ""welcome return to the classical approach"". It is neither necessary nor appropriate for us to comment upon these vicissitudes of the recent English case law. But it is to be observed that the law of passing off contains sufficient nooks and crannies to make it difficult to formulate any satisfactory definition in short form. However, ""the classical trinity"" does serve to emphasise three core concepts in this area of the law. This appeal is concerned with all of them, namely, the geographical requirements for a sufficient reputation, the nature of the interests damaged, and the significance of fraud in the making of the misrepresentation. 166 More recently, in Hansen Beverage Co v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181 , another Full Court of this Court said (at [34] to [37]): 34 In order to succeed in a passing off action, an applicant must establish, as one element of tort existing as at the date when the conduct commenced, that the applicant had the requisite reputation in the name or goods in the jurisdiction of the respondent and that there is a likelihood of deception among consumers or potential consumers resulting from the respondent's actions. An applicant must prove that there are, within the relevant jurisdiction, a substantial number of persons who were aware of the applicant's name or product and are possible consumers. It is necessary to show in a practical and business sense a sufficient reputation in the forum and this requires an evaluation of the size and distribution of the population of prospective consumers likely to be affected: see ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 at 342, 343, 346 (per Lockhart J), and 380 (per French J). 35 The tort of passing off is designed to protect the property and goodwill of a business. It is only available where an applicant can show goodwill or reputation in relation to the name or get-up of his or her goods or services because they have become distinctive of his goods or services in a particular market. An applicant will succeed where he or she can show that a potential customer is likely to be misled into believing that the respondents' goods are goods of the applicant or are somehow associated with the applicant: see Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Limited v Pub Squash Co Pty Limited (1980) 32 ALR 387 at 393. 36 In Conagra 33 FCR at 381, in relation to a claim under the TPA, French J referred to the expression ""a not insignificant number"" of persons who would be potential customers as being an appropriate criterion. His Honour went on to observe that if the similarity complained of is ""commercially irrelevant"", having regard to the number of people who know of that similarity, then the name or get-up is not misleading or deceptive. 37 In considering the question of reputation, although s 52 of the TPA makes no reference to ""reputation"", decisions under that provision have referred to the need to prove a ""significant"" or ""substantial"" proportion of persons within the relevant market who would be likely to be misled: see 10th Cantanae Pty Ltd v Shoshana Pty Limited (1987) 79 ALR 299 at 301; National Exchange Pty Ltd v Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (2004) 61 IPR 420 at 440; cf .au Domain Administration Ltd v Domain Names Australia Pty Limited [2004] FCA 424 ; (2004) 207 ALR 521 at 529-530."
Case1146,applied,Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Limited (2008) 76 IPR 161,"In Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Limited (2008) 76 IPR 161 at [62] to [64] (pp 175 176), Sundberg J set out the principles relevant to the use of a shape as a trade mark as follows: 61 The principles relevant to use of shape as a trade mark are now set out. (a) A special shape which is the whole or part of goods may serve as a badge of origin. However the shape must have a feature that is ""extra"" and distinct from the inherent form of the particular goods: Mayne at [67], Remington at [16] and Kenman Kandy at [137]. (b) Non-descriptive features of a shape point towards a finding that such features are used for a trade mark purpose. Where features are striking, trade mark use will more readily be found. For example, features that make goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive may distinguish the goods from those of others: All-Fect at [25]. (c) Descriptive features, like descriptive words, make it more difficult to establish that those features distinguish the product. For example, the word COLA or an ordinary straight walled bottle are descriptive features that would have limited trade mark significance: All-Fect at [25] and Mayne at [61] [62]. (d) Where the trade mark comprises a shape which involves a substantial functional element in the goods, references to the shape are almost certainly to the nature of the goods themselves rather than use of the shape as a trade mark: Mayne at [63]. For example, evidence that a shape was previously patented will weigh against a finding that the shape serves as a badge of origin: Remington at [12] and Mayne at [69]. (e) If a shape or a feature of a shape is either concocted compared to the inherent form of the shaped goods or incidental to the subject matter of a patent, it is unlikely to be a shape having any functional element. This may point towards the shape being used as a trade mark: Kenman Kandy at [162] and Mayne at [69]. (f) Whether a person has used a shape or a feature of a shape as a trade mark is a matter for the court, and cannot be governed by the absence of evidence on the point: All-Fect at [35]. (g) Context ""is all important"" and will typically characterise the mark's use as either trade mark use or not: Remington at [19] and Mayne at [60] [62]. 62 As is apparent from the foregoing propositions, a shape mark case may require consideration of different types of features in determining whether the mark is used as a trade mark for the purposes of the Act. At one end of the spectrum are shapes or features thereof that are purely functional. The features may have derived substantially from a patented product, such as the S-shaped fence dropper, or go to the usefulness of the product: Remington at [3] and [12]. Cases such as Mayne and Remington show that such features point away from trade mark use. 63 At the other end of the spectrum are those features of a mark that are non-descriptive and non-functional. They ordinarily make the shape more arresting of appearance and more attractive, thus providing a means of distinguishing the goods from those of others. All-Fect and Remington show that non-functional features add something extra to the inherent form of the shape. A concocted feature will typically be considered non-functional: Kenman Kandy . 64 Finally, there will be cases, such as the present, that fall between the ends of the spectrum. These cases are not black and white. They involve consideration of whether one set of features supersedes, submerges or overwhelms the other."

Case1148,followed,Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; (2000) 100 FCR 90,"Counsel also submitted that the respondent does not use the shape or appearance of the Titan chair as a trade mark. He submitted that the respondent merely sells the Titan chair in that shape and depicts the shape of the chair in its brochure for the purpose of describing or identifying the product which it sells. He submitted that the shape of the Titan chair does not contain features which are additional to the inherent form of the chair. He relied upon the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; (2000) 100 FCR 90 as supporting the above propositions. 98 In addition, Counsel for the respondent submitted that Sebel had also failed to demonstrate that the Titan chair was deceptively similar to the Sebel trade mark because: (a) There was no evidence of confusion on the part of any person, even though the Titan chairs had been sold in the United Kingdom for over 12 months and in Australia for a month or so; (b) There were many differences between the Titan chair and the Postura chair which would make it inherently unlikely that the two would be confused or that a person would have cause to wonder whether they came from the same source. He pointed to the catalogue of differences between the Postura chair and the Titan chair set out in Mr Holmes' evidence as well as the labelling on the chair itself; (c) There was no foundation for any concern that the Titan chairs were being discounted or unfairly sold at a lower price; and (d) The typical consumer was a purchasing officer within an educational institution who was price conscious and who would pay special attention to the chairs when making his or her purchase decisions and thus would not be confused. 99 Senior Counsel for Sebel put the proposition that consumers would likely be confused and misled into thinking that the Titan chair and the Sebel Postura chair came from the same source (Sebel), given that Sebel has a substantial reputation in Australia in respect of its Postura range of chairs. 138 In Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Limited (2008) 76 IPR 161 at [62] to [64] (pp 175 176), Sundberg J set out the principles relevant to the use of a shape as a trade mark as follows: 61 The principles relevant to use of shape as a trade mark are now set out.

These cases are not black and white. They involve consideration of whether one set of features supersedes, submerges or overwhelms the other. 141 In Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 , a Full Court of this Court had to consider whether the promotion and sale by Remington of Remington's triple headed electric shaver infringed Philips' registered trade marks which comprised two-dimensional depictions of three shaving heads in the shape of an equilateral triangle. One of the issues in that case was whether Remington's activities involved the use of a trade mark as a trade mark in relation to goods. In the circumstances of that case, the Court held that Remington's promotion and sale of its triple headed electric shaver did not constitute trade mark use. 142 In the course of dealing with these questions, Burchett J (with whom Hill and Branson JJ agreed), said ( Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 at [11] and [12] (pp 100 101)): 11 A trade mark is defined in the Trade Marks Act 1995 by s 17 as ""a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person"". When that definition -- which accords with the basal doctrine of trade mark law: see the passage from the United States Supreme Court decision Estate of P D Beckwith, Inc v Commissioner of Patents (1920) 252 US 538 at 543 which is cited in Johnson &amp; Johnson at 342 -- is required to be applied, regard should be had to a so-called inclusive definition of the word ""sign"" which is to be found in s 6: the word ""includes the following or any combination of the following, namely, any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device, brand, heading, label, ticket, aspect of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent"". Insofar as it is the use of a trade mark in relation to goods with which the Act is concerned, regard must be had also to s 7(4), by which it is provided: ""In this Act: use of a trade mark in relation to goods means use of the trade mark upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods (including second-hand goods)."" The nature of the primary right conferred by the registration of a trade mark is stated in quite summary terms in s 20(1): ""If a trade mark is registered, the registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to this Part, the exclusive rights: (a) to use the trade mark; and (b) to authorise other persons to use the trade mark; in relation to the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered."" It will be observed that this subsection follows the practice, to which Kitto J alluded in Shell Co of Australia Ltd , of omitting to specify that the exclusive right of use is a right to use as a trade mark; however, having regard to the legislative history and the unvarying course of authority, the right must be understood to be so limited. In any case, and somewhat inconsistently, Parliament did decide to specify the nature of the use involved when it came to deal with the subject of infringement. Section 120 provides: ""(1) A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. (2) A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to: (a) goods of the same description as that of goods (registered goods) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or ."" (Emphasis added in subs (1) and in the opening part of subs (2).) 12 In my opinion, merely to produce and deal in goods having the shape, being a functional shape, of something depicted by a trade mark (here the marks do depict, one more completely than the other, a working part of a triple rotary shaver) is not to engage in a ""use"" of the mark ""upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods"" within s 7(4), or to ""use"" it ""in relation to the goods"" within s 20(1). ""Use"" and ""use"", in those contexts, convey the idea of employing the mark, (first) as something that can be ""upon"" or serve in a ""relation"" to the goods, (and secondly) so as to fulfil a purpose, being the purpose of conveying information about their commercial origin. The mark is added, as something distinct from the goods. It may be closely bound up with the goods, as when it is written upon them, or stamped into them, or moulded onto them (see Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 ; (1999) 96 FCR 107 , or, in the case of a liquid, it may be sold in a container so formed as to constitute at once both container and mark. But in none of these cases is the mark devoid of a separate identity from that of the goods. The alternative ways of using a trade mark in relation to goods do not include simply using the goods themselves as the trade mark. The reason is plain: it is to be assumed that goods in the market are useful, and if they are useful, other traders may legitimately wish to produce similar goods (unless, of course, there are, for the time being, subsisting patent, design or other rights to prevent them from doing so), and it follows that a mark consisting of nothing more than the goods themselves could not distinguish their commercial origin, which is the function of a mark: Johnson &amp; Johnson at 342 and 348-349. As Jacob J said of a ""picture mark"" in Philips Electronics NV v Remington Consumer Products at 292: ""A picture of an article is equivalent to a description of it -- both convey information. If the picture is simply of an artefact which traders might legitimately wish to manufacture then to my mind it is just like the common word for it and, like the word for it, incapable of distinguishing."" Even if such a mark achieves registration, that does not make the manufacture and sale of similar artefacts into a use of the mark as a trade mark; cf the remarks, quoted above, of Sargant LJ in Edward Young &amp; Co Ld v Grierson Oldham &amp; Co Ld at 579 about the effect of the registration of the word ""port"" in sloping capitals, remarks which seem to me to apply a fortiori. 144 The reasons of the Court in Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 make clear that: (a) Very often, the concept of use as a trade mark in relation to goods involves the physical application of the trade mark to the goods (eg by stamping or embossing thereon the manufacturer's name or logo) in order to state the origin of the goods for all to see. However, goods may be distinguished by other visible characteristics which they have (eg their shape or colour); (b) This concept of use as a trade mark usually involves the particular trade mark having an identity which is separate from the goods themselves; (c) Generally speaking, this notion of use does not include simply using the goods themselves as a trade mark because a mark consisting of nothing more than the goods themselves could not distinguish the commercial origin of those goods; (d) A shape which is dictated by the nature of the goods or by the need to achieve some particular technical result or functional outcome cannot operate as a trade mark. In order to function as a trade mark, the shape must be something which is extra or which is added to the inherent form of the particular goods as something distinct which can denote origin. A shape cannot function as a trade mark if it is something that other traders may legitimately wish to use either because it is inherent to the particular goods (ie it is of their nature ) or because it provides some technical or functional benefit to the goods. 145 As I understand Sebel's case, there are features of the shape of the Titan chair which are said by Sebel to constitute the use of that shape as a trade mark in relation to goods (namely, sidechairs moulded from plastic materials). Just exactly what those features are and how that use is said to arise were matters which were not made clear by Sebel at the hearing and are not at all clear to me now. 146 As the evidence presently stands, it seems to me that: (a) The alleged shape trade mark said to have been used by the respondent as a trade mark in relation to the Titan chair is not something which is distinct from the Titan chair but is rather of the essence of that chair; (b) The shape embodied in the Titan chair does not contain one or more features which are extra or additional to those which comprise or involve the functional elements of the Titan chair; (c) The shape is devoid of a separate identity from that of the Titan chair itself; and (d) The concept of using a trade mark in relation to goods does not include simply using the goods themselves as a trade mark. In the present case, the respondent is, at most, using or intending to use the Titan chair itself as the trade mark. 147 For these reasons, I am inclined to think that Sebel has failed to prove, even to a prima facie level, that the respondent has used a shape as a trade mark in relation to goods of the relevant class by reason of its promotion and sale of the Titan chair. 148 However, I am very conscious that I am presently dealing with an interlocutory application. For this reason, I am prepared to assume for the time being (without deciding) that Sebel has proven these matters to the requisite level. 180 These passages were cited and followed in Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 (at [37] to [47] (pp 114 116), especially at [40] (pp 114 115). 181 For these reasons, I am of the view that Sebel has failed to establish a prima facie case of passing off. 182 There are two groups of Trade Practices Act claims."

(a) A special shape which is the whole or part of goods may serve as a badge of origin. However the shape must have a feature that is ""extra"" and distinct from the inherent form of the particular goods: Mayne at [67], Remington at [16] and Kenman Kandy at [137]. (b) Non-descriptive features of a shape point towards a finding that such features are used for a trade mark purpose. Where features are striking, trade mark use will more readily be found. For example, features that make goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive may distinguish the goods from those of others: All-Fect at [25]. (c) Descriptive features, like descriptive words, make it more difficult to establish that those features distinguish the product. For example, the word COLA or an ordinary straight walled bottle are descriptive features that would have limited trade mark significance: All-Fect at [25] and Mayne at [61] [62]. (d) Where the trade mark comprises a shape which involves a substantial functional element in the goods, references to the shape are almost certainly to the nature of the goods themselves rather than use of the shape as a trade mark: Mayne at [63]. For example, evidence that a shape was previously patented will weigh against a finding that the shape serves as a badge of origin: Remington at [12] and Mayne at [69]. (e) If a shape or a feature of a shape is either concocted compared to the inherent form of the shaped goods or incidental to the subject matter of a patent, it is unlikely to be a shape having any functional element. This may point towards the shape being used as a trade mark: Kenman Kandy at [162] and Mayne at [69]. (f) Whether a person has used a shape or a feature of a shape as a trade mark is a matter for the court, and cannot be governed by the absence of evidence on the point: All-Fect at [35]. (g) Context ""is all important"" and will typically characterise the mark's use as either trade mark use or not: Remington at [19] and Mayne at [60] [62]. 62 As is apparent from the foregoing propositions, a shape mark case may require consideration of different types of features in determining whether the mark is used as a trade mark for the purposes of the Act. At one end of the spectrum are shapes or features thereof that are purely functional. The features may have derived substantially from a patented product, such as the S-shaped fence dropper, or go to the usefulness of the product: Remington at [3] and [12].

They ordinarily make the shape more arresting of appearance and more attractive, thus providing a means of distinguishing the goods from those of others. All-Fect and Remington show that non-functional features add something extra to the inherent form of the shape. A concocted feature will typically be considered non-functional: Kenman Kandy . 64 Finally, there will be cases, such as the present, that fall between the ends of the spectrum. These cases are not black and white. They involve consideration of whether one set of features supersedes, submerges or overwhelms the other. 140 Similar observations were made by Greenwood J in Mayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited (2008) 166 FCR 312 at [60] to [70] (pp 337 340)."

In some cases this is because the design of a particular article has traditionally, or over a considerable period of time, been accepted as the most suitable for the purpose which the article serves. In some cases indeed no other design would be practicable. In other cases, although the article in question is the product of the invention of a person who is currently trading, the suitability of the design or appearance of the article is such that a market has become established which other manufacturers endeavour to satisfy, as they are entitled to do if no property exists in the design or appearance of the article. In all of these cases, the normal and reasonable way to distinguish one product from another is by marks, brands or labels. If an article is properly labelled so as to show the name of the manufacturer or the source of the article its close resemblance to another article will not mislead an ordinary reasonable member of the public. 178 Mason J (at 210 211) and Brennan J (at 224 226) expressed similar views. 179 The same reasoning would apply to passing off."
Case1151,followed,Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1,"In Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at [65] and [66] (pp 41 43), Brennan CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, in a joint judgment, expressly adopted a passage from Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies (5th edn, 1997, at pp 402 403), which may be summarised as follows: (a) In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application, the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances; (b) Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case; and (c) Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive. 32 I will summarise the relevant facts under the following headings: &#8226; Sebel's Postura Chair &#8226; The Titan Chair &#8226; Sebel's Knowledge of the Titan Chair and Alleged Delay in Bringing its Application &#8226; The Sebel Postura Plus Chair &#8226; The Letter of Demand and Reed Furniture's Response &#8226; The Balance of Convenience 33 Sebel's Postura chair was developed by Sebel in the period 1992 to 1995. It was the product of extensive research carried out by Sebel in this period. The main design principles and special features sought to be reflected in Sebel's range of Postura chairs are illustrated by the following extract from Sebel's 1999 catalogue for the supply by it to NSW Government departments and other NSW authorities and institutions of education and training furniture under NSW Supply Contract 992/1250:"
Case1152,followed,Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365,"The relevant principles are gathered together by French J (as he then was) (with whom Tamberlin J agreed) in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 at [49] and [50] (pp 382 383) as follows: 49 The question of fact for the Court on an appeal from the Registrar in a case of alleged deceptive similarity between marks was posed by the High Court in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v F S Walton &amp; Co Ltd at 658: ""whether in fact there is such a reasonable probability of deception or confusion that the use of the new mark and title should be restrained."" The reference to ""restrained"" reflects the fact that unlike this case the Australian Woollen Mills Ltd case was an appeal in an infringement action. The judgment of the likelihood of deception or confusion is a very practical one and what has long been accepted as the proper approach to making that judgment was set out in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd . It requires assessment of the effect of the challenged mark upon the minds of potential customers. Impression or recollection taken away from the point at which the challenged mark is observed will be the basis of any belief about a connection between the new and the old marks. The effect of spoken description must be considered. What confusion or deception may be expected is to be based upon the behaviour of ordinary people. As potential buyers of goods they are not to be credited with high perception or habitual caution. Exceptional carelessness or stupidity may be disregarded. The question ultimately is not susceptible of much discussion (at 659): ""It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs."" 50 In Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd at 594-595, which concerned the 1905 Act, Kitto J set out a number of propositions which have frequently been quoted and applied to the 1955 Act. The essential elements of those propositions continue to apply to the issue of deceptive similarity under the 1995 Act. Applied also to service marks and absent the imposition of an onus upon the applicant they may be restated as follows: (i) To show that a trade mark is deceptively similar to another it is necessary to show a real tangible danger of deception or confusion occurring. A mere possibility is not sufficient. (ii) A trade mark is likely to cause confusion if the result of its use will be that a number of persons are caused to wonder whether it might not be the case that the two products or closely related products and services come from the same source. It is enough if the ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt. It may be interpolated that this is another way of expressing the proposition that the trade mark is likely to cause confusion if there is a real likelihood that some people will wonder or be left in doubt about whether the two sets of products or the products and services in question come from the same source. (iii) In considering whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion all surrounding circumstances have to be taken into consideration. These include the circumstances in which the marks will be used, the circumstances in which the goods or services will be bought and sold and the character of the probable acquirers of the goods and services. (iv) The rights of the parties are to be determined as at the date of the application. (v) The question of deceptive similarity must be considered in respect of all goods or services coming within the specification in the application and in respect of which registration is desired, not only in respect of those goods or services on which it is proposed to immediately use the mark. The question is not limited to whether a particular use will give rise to deception or confusion. It must be based upon what the applicant can do if registration is obtained. In respect of the last proposition, Mason J observed in Berlei Hestia Industries Ltd v Bali Co Inc [1973] HCA 43 ; (1973) 129 CLR 353 at 362: ""the question whether there is a likelihood of confusion is to be answered, not by reference to the manner in which the respondent has used its mark in the past, but by reference to the use to which it can properly put the mark. The issue is whether that use would give rise to a real danger of confusion."""
Case1153,followed,Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407,"He submitted that, in the present case, the comparison is not a side by side comparison but one based upon imperfect recollection ( Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 415). He further submitted that size and colour were irrelevant to the question of trade mark infringement. 96 Counsel for the respondent submitted that Sebel had failed to show that it had a prima facie case or serious question to be tried. Counsel submitted that no prima facie case had been shown because: (a) The features of Sebel's trade mark encompass nothing more than functional aspects of a one-piece polypropylene chair; (b) It is notorious that shape trade marks are difficult to enforce where their features cover functional aspects of design and the impugned use concerns functionality of the respondent's product; (c) There are substantial differences between the Titan chair and the Postura chair and these differences lead inevitably to the conclusion that they are not substantially identical; and (d) In any event, both the circumstances in which the respective chairs are bought and sold (ie price sensitive consumers making informed and often complex purchase decisions), and the manner in which the Titan chair is marketed and supplied (with the Titan trade mark and logo and Reed's brand), make the suggestion of deceptive similarity very tenuous. 142 In the course of dealing with these questions, Burchett J (with whom Hill and Branson JJ agreed), said ( Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 at [11] and [12] (pp 100 101)): 11 A trade mark is defined in the Trade Marks Act 1995 by s 17 as ""a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person"". When that definition -- which accords with the basal doctrine of trade mark law: see the passage from the United States Supreme Court decision Estate of P D Beckwith, Inc v Commissioner of Patents (1920) 252 US 538 at 543 which is cited in Johnson &amp; Johnson at 342 -- is required to be applied, regard should be had to a so-called inclusive definition of the word ""sign"" which is to be found in s 6: the word ""includes the following or any combination of the following, namely, any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device, brand, heading, label, ticket, aspect of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent"". Insofar as it is the use of a trade mark in relation to goods with which the Act is concerned, regard must be had also to s 7(4), by which it is provided: ""In this Act: use of a trade mark in relation to goods means use of the trade mark upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods (including second-hand goods)."" The nature of the primary right conferred by the registration of a trade mark is stated in quite summary terms in s 20(1): ""If a trade mark is registered, the registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to this Part, the exclusive rights: (a) to use the trade mark; and (b) to authorise other persons to use the trade mark; in relation to the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered."" It will be observed that this subsection follows the practice, to which Kitto J alluded in Shell Co of Australia Ltd , of omitting to specify that the exclusive right of use is a right to use as a trade mark; however, having regard to the legislative history and the unvarying course of authority, the right must be understood to be so limited. In any case, and somewhat inconsistently, Parliament did decide to specify the nature of the use involved when it came to deal with the subject of infringement. Section 120 provides: ""(1) A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. (2) A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to: (a) goods of the same description as that of goods (registered goods) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or ."" (Emphasis added in subs (1) and in the opening part of subs (2).) 12 In my opinion, merely to produce and deal in goods having the shape, being a functional shape, of something depicted by a trade mark (here the marks do depict, one more completely than the other, a working part of a triple rotary shaver) is not to engage in a ""use"" of the mark ""upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods"" within s 7(4), or to ""use"" it ""in relation to the goods"" within s 20(1). ""Use"" and ""use"", in those contexts, convey the idea of employing the mark, (first) as something that can be ""upon"" or serve in a ""relation"" to the goods, (and secondly) so as to fulfil a purpose, being the purpose of conveying information about their commercial origin. The mark is added, as something distinct from the goods. It may be closely bound up with the goods, as when it is written upon them, or stamped into them, or moulded onto them (see Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 ; (1999) 96 FCR 107 , or, in the case of a liquid, it may be sold in a container so formed as to constitute at once both container and mark. But in none of these cases is the mark devoid of a separate identity from that of the goods. The alternative ways of using a trade mark in relation to goods do not include simply using the goods themselves as the trade mark. The reason is plain: it is to be assumed that goods in the market are useful, and if they are useful, other traders may legitimately wish to produce similar goods (unless, of course, there are, for the time being, subsisting patent, design or other rights to prevent them from doing so), and it follows that a mark consisting of nothing more than the goods themselves could not distinguish their commercial origin, which is the function of a mark: Johnson &amp; Johnson at 342 and 348-349. As Jacob J said of a ""picture mark"" in Philips Electronics NV v Remington Consumer Products at 292: ""A picture of an article is equivalent to a description of it -- both convey information. If the picture is simply of an artefact which traders might legitimately wish to manufacture then to my mind it is just like the common word for it and, like the word for it, incapable of distinguishing."" Even if such a mark achieves registration, that does not make the manufacture and sale of similar artefacts into a use of the mark as a trade mark; cf the remarks, quoted above, of Sargant LJ in Edward Young &amp; Co Ld v Grierson Oldham &amp; Co Ld at 579 about the effect of the registration of the word ""port"" in sloping capitals, remarks which seem to me to apply a fortiori. 156 In the present case, the comparison is not a side-by-side comparison but one based upon imperfect recollection ( Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd 109 CLR 407 at 415; see also Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v FS Walton &amp; Co Ltd [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641 at 658). 157 The impression produced in the mind of potential customers which is carried away must be that the challenged trade mark is the same as the registered trade mark. 158 Mr Holmes, on behalf of the respondent, undertook a comparison between the Postura chair and the Titan chair based upon observations which he made. He then produced a catalogue of observable differences between the two chairs in order to negate any question of deceptive similarity between Sebel's trade mark and Reed Furniture's so-called trade mark. Some of these differences are, in my view, barely noticeable. In any event, as Sebel submitted, the approach reflected in Mr Holmes' comparison is not the correct approach to the issue of deceptive similarity."

As Kitto J said in Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592 at 595: It is not necessary, in order to find that a trade mark offends against the section, to prove that there is an actual probability of deception leading to a passing-off. While a mere possibility of confusion is not enough--for there must be a real, tangible danger of its occurring (Reckitt &amp; Colman (Australia) Ltd. v. Boden [3], at pp. 94, 95; Sym Choon &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Gordon Choons Nuts Ltd. [4], at p. 79)--it is sufficient if the result of the user of the mark will be that a number of persons will be caused to wonder whether it might not be the case that the two products come from the same source. It is enough if the ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt. (iii) In considering the probability of deception, all the surrounding circumstances have to be taken into consideration. (This includes the circumstances in which the marks will be used, the circumstances in which the goods will be bought and sold, and the character of the probable purchasers of the goods: Jafferjee v.

Case1155,cited,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559,"It is, as McHugh J observed in Solomons at [37], a long recognised rule of statutory construction that a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in the legislation of a State (or Territory) is a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in that State (or Territory). Statutory provisions can be ""picked up"" by s 79 even though they are expressed in terms applying specifically to State or Territory courts ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559 at [72] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ citing Kruger v The Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 at 140 per Gaudron J; Solomons at [58] per McHugh J).

Justice McHugh commented in Edensor at [141] and affirmed in Solomons at [59] that it is not the literal interpretation of a State Act that determines whether it is applied in Federal Courts but the substance of the Act. The nature of some State and Territory statutes may make them inapplicable to proceedings in the federal jurisdiction. 17 In neither the constitutional challenge nor the substantive proceedings is the Court called upon to interpret or apply a Territory law, but laws of the Commonwealth. Section 79 of the Judiciary Act does not change the meaning of the State or Territory Act that is ""picked up"", nor does it operate to give a State or Territory law a new or extended meaning when it is made applicable in federal jurisdiction ( Edensor at [134] per McHugh J; Solomons at [60] per McHugh J). For these reasons, s 79 of the Judiciary Act does not operate to make s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act applicable to the present proceedings, which involve the application and interpretation of Commonwealth, not Territory, laws."

Case1158,considered,Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179,"As set out in Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179 , Mr Priestley made a number of applications for me to disqualify myself from determining the constitutional challenge. I refused to disqualify myself on three of the grounds advanced by Mr Priestley. I reserved my decision in respect of a fourth ground based on the contention that, by s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act '), the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) ('the Human Rights Act ') applies to these proceedings, being heard in the Australian Capital Territory ('the ACT') ('the fourth ground'). 4 Section 79 of the Judiciary Act relevantly provides: State or Territory laws to govern where applicable (1) The laws of each State or Territory, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence, and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State or Territory in all cases to which they are applicable . (emphasis added) ... (3) This subsection covers a law of a State or Territory that would be applicable to the suit if it did not involve federal jurisdiction, including, for example, a law doing any of the following: (a) limiting the period for bringing the suit to recover the amount; (b) requiring prior notice to be given to the person against whom the suit is brought; (c) barring the suit on the grounds that the person bringing the suit has charged someone else for the amount. 19 I have already dealt with various applications by Mr Priestley that I disqualify myself on the grounds of reasonable apprehension of bias and an asserted lack of independence and impartiality because, he says, neither I nor any judge of the Federal Court can hear and determine the constitutional challenge. In doing so, I applied the common law test as described in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 ( Priestley at [24]). In Forge v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2006] HCA 44 ; (2006) 228 CLR 45 at [66] , Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ described the requirements as discussed by the High Court in Ebner in terms that included the requirement that a court or tribunal must be ""independent"" and ""impartial"". Those are the same terms as used in s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act . Section 21(1) does not relevantly change or add to the test as laid out in Ebner and Forge . It is the same test that I applied in Priestley . 21 Mr Priestley has not advanced any arguments as to my competence or independence, or the appearance of independence, or of impartiality, that were not advanced in his previous applications. His submission remains based on his contention that neither I nor any judge of the Federal Court can hear and determine the constitutional challenge. That has been dealt with in Priestley . The result is the same under the common law and, if it applied, under s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act . In his submission that the requirements in Article 14.1 of the ICCPR must be considered separately by reason of s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act , Mr Priestley has not added to the substance of the grounds for disqualification or recusal that he made previously. 22 It follows that the application that I disqualify myself from determining these proceedings on the fourth ground should be dismissed.

Case1159,cited,Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47 ; (2002) 211 CLR 119,"As was pointed out in Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47 ; (2002) 211 CLR 119 at [22] , s 79 is couched in mandatory terms. The section is addressed to courts exercising federal jurisdiction and is limited to cases to which the State or Territory laws in question are applicable ( Solomons at [23]). 6 It is, as McHugh J observed in Solomons at [37], a long recognised rule of statutory construction that a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in the legislation of a State (or Territory) is a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in that State (or Territory). Statutory provisions can be ""picked up"" by s 79 even though they are expressed in terms applying specifically to State or Territory courts ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559 at [72] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ citing Kruger v The Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 at 140 per Gaudron J; Solomons at [58] per McHugh J). There may also be statutory provisions couched in terms which make it impossible for them to be ""picked up"" ( Edensor at [72]-[74] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Solomons at [24] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ). 7 A court exercising federal jurisdiction has no jurisdiction to apply an Act which, upon its proper construction, applies only to State matters ( Solomons at [33] per McHugh J). Justice McHugh commented in Edensor at [141] and affirmed in Solomons at [59] that it is not the literal interpretation of a State Act that determines whether it is applied in Federal Courts but the substance of the Act. The nature of some State and Territory statutes may make them inapplicable to proceedings in the federal jurisdiction. 17 In neither the constitutional challenge nor the substantive proceedings is the Court called upon to interpret or apply a Territory law, but laws of the Commonwealth.

In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 ( Yusuf ) at [67] [69], McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ made clear that statutory obligations of the present kind require a statement of the administrative tribunal's actual reasons and findings and references to the evidence or other material on which the findings were actually based ( Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; 206 CLR 323 was concerned with s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)). 54 It is not shown that the statement of ""reasons for decision"" provided by the Tribunal did not contain its actual reasons for its decision, did not include its actual findings on material questions of fact, and did not contain a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were actually based. 55 I turn now to the first question relating to s 1184K. According to the amended notice of appeal, Mr Clark relies on the following ground: The Tribunal erred by not taking into account the following relevant matters: i. the unusual unfair or unjust consequences of strict adherence to s 1170(1) in the circumstances of this case; ii. the implication found in s 17(4) that consideration of the total amount of ""periodic compensation payments"" is to be deducted from the ""lump sum compensation"" upon its receipt thereby leaving the appellant in receipt of only one lump sum to the ultimate effect that ""periodic compensation payments"" have not been made; iii. the unintended effect, when considering the objects of the legislation that if the Appellant had received ""compensation affected payments"" and not ""periodic compensation payments"", that the commencement date of the preclusion period would then have commenced on 31 October 2000; iv. the unfairness occasioned by the limitation placed on the Appellant's claim for economic loss compensation after the age of 65 coupled with the requirement that ""periodic compensation payments"" calculated up to the age of 66 were deducted from the appellant's ""lump sum compensation"". 56 In its reasons, the AAT referred to Mr Clark's financial circumstances and health, the fact that he had been legally represented during his settlement negotiations, and that advice had been sought from, and given by, Centrelink. 57 Mr Clark complains that the AAT failed to address the true nature of the ""special circumstances"" on which he relied, namely, that the very provision in s 1170 for a preclusion period worked unjustly in his case. Much of what I have said above in dealing with the first question is relevant to this complaint."
Case1166,followed,"Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; (2002) 116 FCR 348","In Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; (2002) 116 FCR 348 ( Chamberlain ), Kiefel J addressed at some length the question of the circumstances that might be ""special"" within s 1184K. In particular, her Honour reviewed earlier cases and noted (at [32]) that two of them, Kertland v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [1999] FCA 1596 ; (1999) 95 FCR 64 and Secretary, Department of Social Security v Smith (1991) 30 FCR 56, were ""unusual"" in that in them ""it could be seen, objectively, that there could not have been a double payment"", so that ""it might be concluded that the statutory assumption operated unjustly"". Her Honour thought that that situation would not often arise and set those cases apart from the usual. 69 In Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; 116 FCR 348 itself, the effect of the statutory formula was that the applicant would have to pay back more than twice the amount that had been allocated to loss of earnings and of earning capacity in her lump sum settlement. Nonetheless, her Honour thought that such a factor would be present in many cases and was simply an aspect of the outworking of the formula. Her Honour considered that it could not, by itself, amount to ""special circumstances"". 70 Like Mr Clark, Mrs Chamberlain was elderly. She was aged 60 years when, on 13 January 1999, she suffered personal injury in a motor vehicle accident. At the time she was in receipt of an age pension and she had previously received a disability support pension. She claimed to have been able and entitled to earn up to $50 per week from teaching music, without her pension entitlement being affected. Her claim was settled for $35,000 plus $4,000 for costs. The parties to the settlement allocated $31,500 to pain and suffering and medical expenses, and $3,500 to loss of earnings and of earning capacity. 71 Mrs Chamberlain had continued to receive the age pension from the time of the accident. At that time, it was ss 1165 and 1166 of the SS Act that provided for the lump sum preclusion period and refund in Mrs Chamberlain's case, and s 1184 of the SS Act that provided for a discretion in the Secretary to treat the whole or part of a compensation payment as not having been made or not liable to be made if the Secretary should think it appropriate to do so ""in the special circumstances of the case"". Under s 17(3)(a) , the compensation part of the LSP was $17,500. The preclusion period was arrived at by dividing that sum by $422.90, giving a period of 41 weeks. The period ran from the date of the injury, 13 January 1999, to 26 October 1999. The statutory formula produced the result that in respect of that period, Mrs Chamberlain was liable to pay to the Commonwealth $7,643.36 more than twice the sum of $3,500 mentioned above. 72 Kiefel J stated (at [34] [35]): [34] The basis for the Tribunal's view [that ""special circumstances"" were established] was its acceptance of what the parties to the settlement said had been offered and accepted for the economic loss component. It was far less than the statute assumed to be the case in applying the formulae. Again, however, this will be so in many, if not most, cases to which the Act applies. Further, the extent of the difference from the basis upon which the parties acted could not provide the necessary ""special circumstance"". The statute has selected a figure which may operate in an arbitrary way. [35] The statutory objectives in utilising the formulae, referred to above, must also be borne in mind. It is not intended that a decision-maker be required to consider contentions about what part of the compensation reflected the economic loss component. That is so whether one has regard to the application of the formulae or the discretion under s 1184. The latter does not alter the objective and must be read in light of it. 73 Her Honour set aside the Tribunal's decision. 74 If Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; 116 FCR 348 is to be followed, the present application must be dismissed. 75 I respectfully agree with the approach that was taken by Kiefel J. The expression ""special circumstances"" in s 1184K does not embrace the circumstance that the 50 percent rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive, even grossly excessive, having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity, to the age of the injured person, and perhaps to other circumstances. 76 Once one embarks on an inquiry of the kind that would be required in such a case, one is defeating the legislative intention. The Parliament must be taken to have contemplated as ""usual"" or ""ordinary"" the circumstances of people placed as Mr Clark is. In effect, by adopting the rough and ready 50 percent rule, the legislature has faced such people with a choice: not sue at all and to rely, instead, on such other entitlements as may be available; litigate to trial so that the Court will identify a figure for loss of earnings and of earning capacity; or settle subject to the operation of the 50 percent rule. 77 In the present case, Mr Clark must be taken to have decided against the former two courses. I do not know why he did so. In one sense, it seems unfair that Mr Clark should suffer a preclusion period until 15 February 2008, but I do not think that this constitutes ""special circumstances"" in the light of the legislative intention. 78 If the position were otherwise, the r&eacute;gime that was introduced in 1988 would be defeated because it would be again open to parties to a settlement to attribute an artificially low figure to loss of earnings and earning capacity, and to the injured person, through s 1184K of the SS Act, to initiate the very kind of investigation that it was the intention of the 1988 amending Act to eliminate. 79 For the above reasons, I do not think that the AAT erred in law in failing to exercise the discretion given by s 1184K of the SS Act."
Case1167,cited,"Secretary, Department of Social Security v Banks (1990) 20 ALD 19","It is useful to look at the policy considerations that informed the inclusion of the 50 percent rule in the SS Act. Provisions that were substantially the same as ss 17(3)(a) were introduced by the Social Security Amendment Act 1988 (Cth) (Act No 58 of 1988) . The Second Reading Speech on the Bill set out the reason for the rule (Australia, House of Representatives, Debates (13 April 1988) Vol HR160, p 1497 (Mrs Kelly, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel)): This Bill contains measures to improve the administration and integrity of the compensation recovery provisions. Where a person receives personal injury compensation that makes up for lost income the Social Security Act provides that pension or benefit may be reduced or recovered. This is one way in which social security expenditures are directed to those most in need. Settlements of lump sum compensation particularly in the workers compensation jurisdiction are being manipulated to obscure the economic loss component and to avoid recovery of social security payments. To prevent this abuse, the Minister announced on 8 February 1988 that, for future personal injury settlements made by agreement or by consent order, 50 per cent of lump sum compensation will be deemed to be in respect of economic loss. This Bill gives effect to that proposal. It is clear that the policy objective was to prevent manipulation to obscure the economic loss component in compensation payments and instead deem a flat 50 percent in all cases, with a reduced preclusion period to compensate for an RPCP component. In deciding Mr Clark's case, the AAT had regard to this policy, citing the discussion of the amendments and the background to them by von Doussa J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Banks (1990) 20 ALD 19. 42 The construction supported by Mr Clark would itself result in an anomaly in relation to a young person whose loss of earning capacity accounted for a large part of his or her lump sum compensation payment. Assume a settlement for an LSP of $2,000,000, that there was an RPCP of $200,000, and that, although not specified, the sum of $2,000,000 included $1,400,000 for loss of earning capacity. According to the s 17(3) and s 17(4) formulae, the compensation part of the LSP would be only $900,000. On what basis in fairness would the injured young person have a claim to have the preclusion period (calculated by reference to that amount) begin back on the date of the injury, rather than the day after the end of the period covered by the periodical compensation payments of $200,000? The arbitrary figure of $900,000 would already be an understatement of the amount received for loss of earnings and of earning capacity, and to adopt the date of the injury as the start of the preclusion period would only increase the ""over generous"" treatment of the injured young person. In a perfect world, the preclusion period would run from the date of injury until the sum of $1,400,000 was exhausted, and in Mr Clark's case from 31 October 2000 until whatever amount was included in the sum of $280,000 for loss of earnings and of earning capacity was exhausted. But in an imperfect world in which settlement figures were being manipulated so as to understate the component for loss of earnings and of earning capacity, the legislature has solved the problem by the rough and ready 50 percent rule. 43 The provisions reflect a policy decision to treat that which remains after any repayment of any periodic compensation payments as relating, as to 50 percent, to loss of earnings or of earning capacity, in respect of the period after the expiry of the period covered by those payments. The provisions reflect an acceptance by the legislature that it is not practicable to achieve complete justice attuned to the circumstances of each individual case."

So that these reasons may be self contained, it is convenient to reproduce the bulk of the factual and procedural background set out in the earlier judgment. 3 Forestview was incorporated in February 1994. Its current directors are Norman Phillip Carey, who has been a director since its incorporation, and his sister, Karen Sandra Carey-Hazell, who has been a director since 19 January 1996.

Case1172,applied,PP Consultants Pty Ltd v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2000] HCA 59 ; (2000) 201 CLR 648,"In substance, Mr Urquhart's case was that: (a) When Powercor contracted out its meter reading function to AMRS in 2002 and 2004, part of Powercor's business (namely, meter reading) was transmitted to AMRS. For Mr Urquhart, counsel argued that meter reading was part of Powercor's business prior to the VMM contract. He argued that Powercor took back this part of its business when the VMM contract terminated and, again, when the Marshmans contract ended. Counsel contended that the Electricity Industry Act 2000 (Vic) (""the Electricity Industry Act ""), the Electricity Distribution Licence, and the numerous regulatory Codes illustrated ""both the essential part metering play[ed] in the distribution of electricity as well as the ongoing obligations of the distributor, regardless of whether or not the task [had] been outsourced"". Counsel argued that, ""[b]y reason of the ... obligations imposed on distributors and conditions of licence meter reading and the related activities undertaken by meter readers [meter reading] was more than an ancillary part of the business of a distributor and [was] in fact a necessary part of the business"". He submitted that whether or not Powercor performed meter reading between the contracts was irrelevant. For the duration of the contract between Powercor and AMRS, AMRS had ""what ... Powercor has within its power to give"". Counsel for Mr Urquhart relied on PP Consultants Pty Ltd v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2000] HCA 59 ; (2000) 201 CLR 648 ("" PP Consultants ""), Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations v Gribbles Radiology Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 9 ; (2005) 222 CLR 194 ("" Gribbles "") and Stellar Call Centres Pty Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal Plumbing and Allied Services Union [2001] FCA 106 ; (2001) 106 FCR 302 ("" Stellar Call Centres ""). He also relied on Construction Forestry Mining &amp; Energy Union v Henry Walker Eltin Contracting Pty Ltd (2001) 108 IR 409 ("" CFMEU v Henry Walker Eltin ""), Minister of State for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business v Community and Public Sector Union [2001] FCA 316 ; (2001) 109 FCR 303 and North Western Health Care Network v Health Services Union of Australia [1999] FCA 897 ; (1999) 92 FCR 477 ("" North Western Health Care ""). (b) In these circumstances, by operation of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement were binding on AMRS. Counsel for Mr Urquhart referred to the 1965 Award, 1969 Variations, the National Wage Cases , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement in support of his submission that, whilst employed by AMRS, Mr Urquhart was entitled to be paid wages and superannuation at the rate for which the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement provided, and not at the rate he was in fact paid by AMRS, but with the loading prescribed by the 1998 Award. He referred to the principles for interpreting awards in various cases, including in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (2006) 153 IR 426. He contended that, properly construed, the underpayment that Mr Urquhart claimed in his relief (see [4]) included the loading for which the 1998 Award provided calculated by reference to the 1999 and 2002 certified agreement rates (as well as the difference between the amounts for which these certified agreements provided and that which he was actually paid). 39 AMRS responded that: (a) Powercor's contracting out of the meter reading function did not constitute a transmission of business as meter reading was not Powercor's business, or part of its business. Rather, meter reading was an ancillary function that supported the core business of Powercor, which was to distribute electricity. AMRS also relied on PP Consultants , Gribbles and Stellar Call Centres . AMRS submitted that meter reading was not an essential, or even significant, part of the business of distributing electricity. Nor was it part of the development or maintenance of the assets used to generate electricity, the use of which enabled a fee to be charged to the retailers. AMRS contended that there was a material difference between the metering of electricity use and the reading of meters. This distinction was apparent in each of the outsourcing contracts and in Powercor's distribution licence. (b) If it were wrong in the above submission, then there was no transmission of business to AMRS in 2002 and 2004 as it had already been transmitted to VMM in 1997. Powercor had not, since that time, ""contracted in"" the meter reading function. Hence, at the time of contracting out meter reading to AMRS, Powercor had no meter reading business left to transmit. Alternatively, there was no transmission because, under Powercor's distribution licence and the relevant Codes, Powercor retained the obligations with respect to meters and meter-reading. Further, there was no transfer of assets from Powercor to AMRS. (c) If Powercor's meter reading function constituted its business or part of its business and such business was transmitted to AMRS, then neither the 1998 Award, nor the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement applied to meter readers (such as Mr Urquhart). Therefore, Mr Urquhart was not entitled to be paid in accordance with those instruments. AMRS argued that, even if a generous approach was adopted to the interpretation of the 1998 Award, there was nothing in the 1998 Award that imposed a legal obligation on Powercor to classify, or pay, meter readers under the 1998 Award. Moreover, the history did not disclose that that there was any previous agreement or award relevant to the 1998 Award showing that meter readers were to be covered by the award. Neither the 1999 Agreement nor the 2002 Agreement expressly sets out which Powercor employees were to be covered by these agreements. Rather, by reference to Appendix C in the case of the 1999 Agreement and Appendix D in the case of the 2002 Agreement, each instrument sets out rates of pay within the structure of a 30-point pay scale. In the absence of express provision, AMRS contended that it was proper to consider the industrial and statutory context surrounding the Agreements. This required attention to the objective facts. AMRS argued that the translation exercise undertaken within Powercor after the 1997 Agreement was not relevant to the construction question. Even if this exercise could be taken into account in construing the 1999 Agreement, at the time of certification of the 1999 Agreement (and the 2002 Agreement), Powercor did not employ any standard meter readers. AMRS submitted that, in the circumstances, it could not be said that, viewed objectively, the pay point classification scheme in the two agreements was intended to cover standard meter readers. AMRS further argued that its approach was supported by the statutory context surrounding the certification of enterprise agreements. AMRS submitted that clause 8.2.2 of the 1998 Award made it clear that the loading of 25% attached to the rates of pay prescribed in the Award and not the rates in the 1999 or 2002 Agreements. 42 The first critical question is whether, for the purposes of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , AMRS is the transmittee of the business or part of the business of Powercor. Whether there has been transmission (or a succession or assignment), for these purposes, is a mixed question of fact and law. PP Consultants indicates how this question should be considered. 43 According to PP Consultants , as a general rule, in a case such as the present, it is necessary, first, to identify or characterise the business or the relevant part of the business of the first employer; secondly, to identify the character of the transferred business activities in the hands of the new employer; and, thirdly, to compare the two business: see PP Consultants at 655 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ. If, in substance, the business of the first employer has the same character as the transferred business activities in the hands of the new employer, then it may be possible to say the business, or a part of the business of the first employer had been transmitted to the new employer. If the business of the first employer does not have the same character as the transferred business activities of the new employer, then there can be no transmission (or succession or assignment). 44 The joint judgment in PP Consultants illustrates this approach. The analysis began with the proposition that St George Bank Ltd was in the business of banking and the activities in which it engaged at its branch at Byron Bay were part of its banking business (at 655). The pharmacist that the Bank appointed to carry on a branch agency after it closed this branch did not engage in the business of banking, although it engaged in banking activities (at 656). The pharmacist was, so their Honours held, carrying on the business of a banking agent. Their Honours said (at 656): All that has happened is that the Bank has changed the method by which it carried on its banking business in Byron Bay. Thus, no part of the Bank's business has been acquired by the [pharmacist], whether as successor, assignee or transmittee. On this approach, the fact that the activities carried on by the old and new employers were the same as far as the employees were concerned was immaterial. 47 Stellar Call Centres applied the reasoning in PP Consultants to an inquiry under ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(1) (which, for present purposes, is in relevantly the same terms as s 170MB(2)). In the Full Court of this Court, Stellar Call Centres challenged the decision of the judge at first instance that, pursuant to ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(1) of the Workplace Relations Act , it was bound by awards and certified agreements binding on Telstra Corporation Ltd (""Telstra""). The question was whether a part of Telstra's business that involved the taking and responding to telephone calls from Telstra's customers had been transmitted to Stellar Call Centres. The Full Court held that there was no such transmission, chiefly because the receiving of the calls from customers were ""activities in support of Telstra's businesses in the telecommunication industry"" but were ""not themselves ... the business or part of the business of Telstra"": see Stellar Call Centres at 311. The Full Court said (at 311): That business can appropriately be characterised as providing telecommunications services to its customers. In the course of conducting that business, Telstra is called upon to respond to enquiries, requests for services and complaints from its customers, including those made by telephone. However, the making of those responses is not a distinct 'part' of Telstra's business within the meaning of s 149(1) , as explained by the High Court, any more than, for example, cleaning undertaken as a necessary aspect of the conduct of a restaurant is a 'part' of the business of the restauranteur. The business of Stellar Call Centres was the provision of telephone answering services. The answering of calls was not, however, a part of Telstra's business; and, accordingly, there was no transmission of that part of Telstra's business. 66 In response, counsel for Mr Urquhart argued that ""transmission"" was a non-legal concept and did not depend upon privity or any formal legal transfer of rights between the parties. Moreover, he submitted that the Court should not give weight to the consideration as to whether or not Powercor technically retained rights or obligations with respect to meter reading, because to give weight to this consideration would not reflect commercial reality. He referred to North Western Health Care and Australian Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union v Torrens Transit Services Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1683 ; (2000) 105 FCR 88 , which applied North Western Health Care . Both cases concerned, amongst other things, a transmission of the business of State government or department and, in any event, for the reasons appearing below, since PP Consultants and Gribbles , North Western Health Care can no longer be said reliably to state the law in this area. 68 Although the authors of the joint judgment in PP Consultants decided that case primarily on the basis of the characterisation test referred to earlier, holding that the pharmacy was not engaged in the banking business, they also added (at 656): Moreover, the Bank has not disposed of any part of its business. All that has happened is that the Bank has changed the method by which it carried on its banking business in Byron Bay. Thus, no part of the Bank's business has been acquired by the [pharmacy], whether as successor, assignee or transmittee. In effect, the joint judgment in PP Consultants set out two tests for succession, assignment and transmission a characterisation test (discussed above) and a disposal test. Both tests must be satisfied in order for the operation of the award (under s 149(1)(d)) or the certified agreement (under s 170MB(2)) to be attracted to the new employer. 69 As it happened, in his separate judgment, Callinan J (agreeing with the joint judgment in the result) considered the issue of disposal at greater length than in the joint judgment. After noting considerations that were not dissimilar to those relied on by AMRS, his Honour identified the question that he considered should be asked: see PP Consultants at 664. Adapted to this case, this question is, what 'business', which Powercor is said to have transmitted to AMRS, could AMRS sell or otherwise pass on to someone else? If this is a correct question to ask in connection with transmission, for the reasons stated below, the answer, as in PP Consultants , would be ""no business"". Callinan J's conclusion (at 665) that ""[t]he business of the bank had not 'passed'""; rather ""[a] new form of business was created (by agreement) and was to be carried on by a new operator as an agent"" might also summarise the effect of the 2002 contract. Under the 2002 contract, the business of Powercor did not pass (and was not transmitted). Rather, under the contract, AMRS was to carry on a new business of meter reading for Powercor. 70 The foregoing notwithstanding, I might still be in some doubt as to the correct analysis to be followed had PP Consultants not been succeeded in the High Court by Gribbles . The combined effect of these two decisions is, so it seems to me, to make the relevant state of the law reasonably clear with respect to provisions like ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act . In Gribbles , the High Court confirmed that the characterisation test (identifying the business or part of a business) and the disposal test (determining whether the business or part of a business so characterised was disposed of) are separate and distinct questions. Thus, in their joint judgment in Gribbles , Gleeson CJ, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ stated (at 213): [T]he need, when considering the application of s 149(1)(d) [is] to do two things. First, it is necessary to identify exactly what is meant in the context of the particular case, by 'the business or part of the business' of the former employer. Secondly, it is necessary to identify what part of that 'business' the former employer once had which is now enjoyed by the person allegedly bound by the award. 73 In this case, unlike Gribbles , there was a direct transaction between the former and the new employers, as expressed in the 2002 contract (and, subsequently, transactions expressed in the 2003 contract and the 2004 contract). Accordingly, this (like PP Consultants ) is one of the ""many cases"" where the answer is to be found by considering the transaction between the former and the new employers. 74 It is worth noting that, in Gribbles , the characterisation test was on the facts of the case easily satisfied in contrast to PP Consultants where it was not satisfied at all: see Gribbles at 214. The majority in Gribbles (at 214-15) thus focussed on the disposal test or, from the new employer's perspective, the enjoyment test, whilst this aspect called for very much less attention in PP Consultants . Considered in this way, PP Consultants and Gribbles are complementary aspects of the overarching question whether there has been a transmission, succession or assignment. 77 The majority judgment in Gribbles shows that some aspects of the transaction between Powercor and AMRS are more relevant than others to the disposal/enjoyment test. In particular, it must be asked whether the new employer has acquired any of the tangible or intangible assets of the old employer: compare Gribbles at 212. In Gribbles , the majority found that, by the relevant transaction, the new employer did not come to enjoy either the tangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's equipment) or the intangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's goodwill): see Gribbles 214. Further, citing Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014 , the majority also recognised that, while both former and new employers employed the same employees, ""no employee is an asset in the employer's balance sheet to be bought or sold"": Gribbles at 214. Accordingly, the majority concluded that the former employer had not disposed of any part of its business and the new employer was not, therefore, a successor to or of any part of the business of the former employer because ""[a]t no time did [the new employer] enjoy any asset of the [former employer], tangible or intangible, which [the former employer] had used in the pursuit of its business activities"": see Gribbles at 204. This test is substantially identical to that proposed by Callinan J in PP Consultants (at 664) in that his Honour there asked whether there was anything for the new employer ""to sell or otherwise pass on to someone else"". 80 It might be said that the High Court's analysis of the operation of s 149(1)(d) and like provisions allows employers, in effect, to ""contract out"" of their obligations under awards and certified agreements with comparative ease. In PP Consultants (at 666) Callinan J sought to meet this objection, in the following way: Whilst it may be accepted that a purpose of the provision is to prevent evasion of obligations by employers who do succeed to a business or part thereof, there is another policy consideration which bears on this case. The legislation, it may be inferred requires a common identity of a business or part thereof, into whosoever hands it falls, on the assumption that a successor will have the same and continuing capacity to meet the obligations arising under an award as the former operator of the business. No such assumption may safely be made about a different business. 82 These fundamental differences in perspective and approach have been the subject of scholarly discussions, which have proposed alternative analyses: see, for example, Trent D Sebbens, ""'Wake, O Wake' Transmission of Business Provisions in Outsourcing and Privatisation"" (2003) 16 Australian Journal of Labour Law 133. This Court is, however, bound to follow PP Consultants and Gribbles , which provide a clear answer in this case."
Case1173,applied,Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations v Gribbles Radiology Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 9 ; (2005) 222 CLR 194,"In substance, Mr Urquhart's case was that: (a) When Powercor contracted out its meter reading function to AMRS in 2002 and 2004, part of Powercor's business (namely, meter reading) was transmitted to AMRS. For Mr Urquhart, counsel argued that meter reading was part of Powercor's business prior to the VMM contract. He argued that Powercor took back this part of its business when the VMM contract terminated and, again, when the Marshmans contract ended. Counsel contended that the Electricity Industry Act 2000 (Vic) (""the Electricity Industry Act ""), the Electricity Distribution Licence, and the numerous regulatory Codes illustrated ""both the essential part metering play[ed] in the distribution of electricity as well as the ongoing obligations of the distributor, regardless of whether or not the task [had] been outsourced"". Counsel argued that, ""[b]y reason of the ... obligations imposed on distributors and conditions of licence meter reading and the related activities undertaken by meter readers [meter reading] was more than an ancillary part of the business of a distributor and [was] in fact a necessary part of the business"". He submitted that whether or not Powercor performed meter reading between the contracts was irrelevant. For the duration of the contract between Powercor and AMRS, AMRS had ""what ... Powercor has within its power to give"". Counsel for Mr Urquhart relied on PP Consultants Pty Ltd v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2000] HCA 59 ; (2000) 201 CLR 648 ("" PP Consultants ""), Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations v Gribbles Radiology Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 9 ; (2005) 222 CLR 194 ("" Gribbles "") and Stellar Call Centres Pty Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal Plumbing and Allied Services Union [2001] FCA 106 ; (2001) 106 FCR 302 ("" Stellar Call Centres ""). He also relied on Construction Forestry Mining &amp; Energy Union v Henry Walker Eltin Contracting Pty Ltd (2001) 108 IR 409 ("" CFMEU v Henry Walker Eltin ""), Minister of State for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business v Community and Public Sector Union [2001] FCA 316 ; (2001) 109 FCR 303 and North Western Health Care Network v Health Services Union of Australia [1999] FCA 897 ; (1999) 92 FCR 477 ("" North Western Health Care ""). (b) In these circumstances, by operation of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement were binding on AMRS. Counsel for Mr Urquhart referred to the 1965 Award, 1969 Variations, the National Wage Cases , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement in support of his submission that, whilst employed by AMRS, Mr Urquhart was entitled to be paid wages and superannuation at the rate for which the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement provided, and not at the rate he was in fact paid by AMRS, but with the loading prescribed by the 1998 Award. He referred to the principles for interpreting awards in various cases, including in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (2006) 153 IR 426. He contended that, properly construed, the underpayment that Mr Urquhart claimed in his relief (see [4]) included the loading for which the 1998 Award provided calculated by reference to the 1999 and 2002 certified agreement rates (as well as the difference between the amounts for which these certified agreements provided and that which he was actually paid). 39 AMRS responded that: (a) Powercor's contracting out of the meter reading function did not constitute a transmission of business as meter reading was not Powercor's business, or part of its business. Rather, meter reading was an ancillary function that supported the core business of Powercor, which was to distribute electricity. AMRS also relied on PP Consultants , Gribbles and Stellar Call Centres . AMRS submitted that meter reading was not an essential, or even significant, part of the business of distributing electricity. Nor was it part of the development or maintenance of the assets used to generate electricity, the use of which enabled a fee to be charged to the retailers. AMRS contended that there was a material difference between the metering of electricity use and the reading of meters. This distinction was apparent in each of the outsourcing contracts and in Powercor's distribution licence. (b) If it were wrong in the above submission, then there was no transmission of business to AMRS in 2002 and 2004 as it had already been transmitted to VMM in 1997. Powercor had not, since that time, ""contracted in"" the meter reading function. Hence, at the time of contracting out meter reading to AMRS, Powercor had no meter reading business left to transmit. Alternatively, there was no transmission because, under Powercor's distribution licence and the relevant Codes, Powercor retained the obligations with respect to meters and meter-reading. Further, there was no transfer of assets from Powercor to AMRS. (c) If Powercor's meter reading function constituted its business or part of its business and such business was transmitted to AMRS, then neither the 1998 Award, nor the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement applied to meter readers (such as Mr Urquhart). Therefore, Mr Urquhart was not entitled to be paid in accordance with those instruments. AMRS argued that, even if a generous approach was adopted to the interpretation of the 1998 Award, there was nothing in the 1998 Award that imposed a legal obligation on Powercor to classify, or pay, meter readers under the 1998 Award. Moreover, the history did not disclose that that there was any previous agreement or award relevant to the 1998 Award showing that meter readers were to be covered by the award. Neither the 1999 Agreement nor the 2002 Agreement expressly sets out which Powercor employees were to be covered by these agreements. Rather, by reference to Appendix C in the case of the 1999 Agreement and Appendix D in the case of the 2002 Agreement, each instrument sets out rates of pay within the structure of a 30-point pay scale. In the absence of express provision, AMRS contended that it was proper to consider the industrial and statutory context surrounding the Agreements. This required attention to the objective facts. AMRS argued that the translation exercise undertaken within Powercor after the 1997 Agreement was not relevant to the construction question. Even if this exercise could be taken into account in construing the 1999 Agreement, at the time of certification of the 1999 Agreement (and the 2002 Agreement), Powercor did not employ any standard meter readers. AMRS submitted that, in the circumstances, it could not be said that, viewed objectively, the pay point classification scheme in the two agreements was intended to cover standard meter readers. AMRS further argued that its approach was supported by the statutory context surrounding the certification of enterprise agreements. AMRS submitted that clause 8.2.2 of the 1998 Award made it clear that the loading of 25% attached to the rates of pay prescribed in the Award and not the rates in the 1999 or 2002 Agreements. 45 Gribbles also concerned s 149(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act , although the focus in this case was on the meaning of the word ""successor"" in this provision. A company called Region Dell Pty Ltd conducted medical clinics, including one at Moorabbin. The company licensed the use of part of the Moorabbin clinic's premises for a radiology practice. The company also supplied the equipment. The radiology practice supplied the radiographers, consumables and the like. The company had granted three such licences the first, to Southern Radiology; the second until 31 August 1999, to MDIG; and the third, from 1 September 1999, to Gribbles. In 2000, Gribbles terminated the employment of the radiographers at Moorabbin. If Gribbles were bound by the Award that had bound MDIG, then Gribbles was bound to pay severance pay to the radiographers. This turned on whether Gribbles was a successor, for the purposes of s 149(1)(d) , to or to any part of the business of MDIG. In a joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ held that it was not. 46 In the course of this judgment, their Honours touched on the meaning of the word ""business"" in this context. As their Honours said, to be a ""successor"" (or assignee or transmittee), it is not enough that the new employer pursues the same kind of business as the old: Gribbles at 211. What was meant by the word ""business"" in this context depends on s 149(1)(d) , which ""focuses upon succession, assignment and transmission to or of a business which is identified as the business of an employer"", which ""necessarily directs attention to what it is that the former employer had which is to be described as the 'business' of that employer"": Gribbles at 211. Their Honours went on to say (at 212): The 'business' of an employer may be constituted by a number of different assets, both tangible and intangible, that are used in the particular pursuit, whether of profit (if the 'business' is a commercial enterprise) or other ends ... In the case of a commercial enterprise, identifying the employer's 'business' will usually require identification both of the particular activity that is pursued and of the tangible and intangible assets that are used in that pursuit. The 'business' of an employer will be identified as the assets that the employer uses in the pursuit of the particular activity. It is the assets used in that way that can be assigned or transmitted and it is to the assets used in that way that an employer can be a successor. The new employer may be a successor, assignee or transmittee to or of the business, or part of the business, of an employer who was a party to the relevant industrial dispute if the new employer, having the beneficial use of assets which the former employer used in the relevant pursuit, uses those assets in the same or a similar pursuit. ... Whether the new employer is a successor, assignee or transmittee, will require examination of whether what the new employer has can be described as a part of the former employer's business. In s 149(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act , ""the business or part of the business"" of the former employer which in the present case is Powercor is thus to be characterised by reference to the particular activity that it pursued and the assets that it used in that pursuit. As Stellar Call Centres shows, whether a new employer ""becomes the ... transmittee ... of the whole or a part of the business concerned"", for the purposes of subs 170MB(2) depends on much the same inquiry. 66 In response, counsel for Mr Urquhart argued that ""transmission"" was a non-legal concept and did not depend upon privity or any formal legal transfer of rights between the parties. Moreover, he submitted that the Court should not give weight to the consideration as to whether or not Powercor technically retained rights or obligations with respect to meter reading, because to give weight to this consideration would not reflect commercial reality. He referred to North Western Health Care and Australian Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union v Torrens Transit Services Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1683 ; (2000) 105 FCR 88 , which applied North Western Health Care . Both cases concerned, amongst other things, a transmission of the business of State government or department and, in any event, for the reasons appearing below, since PP Consultants and Gribbles , North Western Health Care can no longer be said reliably to state the law in this area. 70 The foregoing notwithstanding, I might still be in some doubt as to the correct analysis to be followed had PP Consultants not been succeeded in the High Court by Gribbles . The combined effect of these two decisions is, so it seems to me, to make the relevant state of the law reasonably clear with respect to provisions like ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act . In Gribbles , the High Court confirmed that the characterisation test (identifying the business or part of a business) and the disposal test (determining whether the business or part of a business so characterised was disposed of) are separate and distinct questions. Thus, in their joint judgment in Gribbles , Gleeson CJ, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ stated (at 213): [T]he need, when considering the application of s 149(1)(d) [is] to do two things. First, it is necessary to identify exactly what is meant in the context of the particular case, by 'the business or part of the business' of the former employer. Secondly, it is necessary to identify what part of that 'business' the former employer once had which is now enjoyed by the person allegedly bound by the award. 71 Before discussing Gribbles further, I would acknowledge that, as counsel for Mr Urquhart observed, Gribbles is distinguishable in at least one respect from this case because Gribbles , in contrast to this case, involved no direct transaction between the former employer and the new employer. That is, Gribbles involved the question whether there had been a ""succession"" by the new employer to the old employer's business, and did not involve a question of ""transmission"": see Gribbles at 203-204 and 208. This distinction does not, however, affect the critical reasoning in Gribbles , as the majority judgment shows. 72 The majority in Gribbles (at 212) acknowledged the distinction, by observing that the answer as to whether there has been an assignment, succession or transmission: ... will be provided by looking at some transaction between the two employers. Where there has been some transaction between them, it will be possible to see whether the former employer transferred the whole, or part, of its business to the new employer. But in other cases there may be no transaction between the former employer and the employer alleged to be its successor ... Thus, the existence of some transaction between the two employers is not essential in order to show that one is the successor to the business of the other. Further, whether or not there was some transaction between the new employer and the former employer, there may be a real question about whether what the new employer enjoys is the whole or a part of the 'business' of the former employer. 73 In this case, unlike Gribbles , there was a direct transaction between the former and the new employers, as expressed in the 2002 contract (and, subsequently, transactions expressed in the 2003 contract and the 2004 contract). Accordingly, this (like PP Consultants ) is one of the ""many cases"" where the answer is to be found by considering the transaction between the former and the new employers. 74 It is worth noting that, in Gribbles , the characterisation test was on the facts of the case easily satisfied in contrast to PP Consultants where it was not satisfied at all: see Gribbles at 214. The majority in Gribbles (at 214-15) thus focussed on the disposal test or, from the new employer's perspective, the enjoyment test, whilst this aspect called for very much less attention in PP Consultants . Considered in this way, PP Consultants and Gribbles are complementary aspects of the overarching question whether there has been a transmission, succession or assignment. 75 Assuming (contrary to the finding above) that the characterisation test is satisfied since meter reading constituted a part of the business of Powercor, the critical question is that presented in Gribbles whether it can be properly said that Powercor disposed of a meter reading business, which is now enjoyed by AMRS. 76 In the present case, there is a degree of artificiality about this inquiry since it fails to take account of the fact that the former employer (Powercor) had entered into similar contracts with VMM and Marshmans immediately before entering into the 2002 contract with AMRS. In this context, if there was a transmission to AMRS, it must be assumed that either similar transmissions to VMM and Marshmans were limited to the duration of their respective contracts or, for some unapparent reason, the transactions between Powercor and VMM and Marshmans were relevantly different, with the consequence that there was no previous transmission. I do not stop to investigate these possibilities further because, in my view, there was no transmission between Powercor and AMRS. The critical question in Gribbles whether it can be said that Powercor disposed of a meter reading business that is now enjoyed by AMRS on the facts as disclosed in the evidence must be answered ""no"". 77 The majority judgment in Gribbles shows that some aspects of the transaction between Powercor and AMRS are more relevant than others to the disposal/enjoyment test. In particular, it must be asked whether the new employer has acquired any of the tangible or intangible assets of the old employer: compare Gribbles at 212. In Gribbles , the majority found that, by the relevant transaction, the new employer did not come to enjoy either the tangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's equipment) or the intangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's goodwill): see Gribbles 214. Further, citing Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014 , the majority also recognised that, while both former and new employers employed the same employees, ""no employee is an asset in the employer's balance sheet to be bought or sold"": Gribbles at 214. Accordingly, the majority concluded that the former employer had not disposed of any part of its business and the new employer was not, therefore, a successor to or of any part of the business of the former employer because ""[a]t no time did [the new employer] enjoy any asset of the [former employer], tangible or intangible, which [the former employer] had used in the pursuit of its business activities"": see Gribbles at 204. This test is substantially identical to that proposed by Callinan J in PP Consultants (at 664) in that his Honour there asked whether there was anything for the new employer ""to sell or otherwise pass on to someone else"". 82 These fundamental differences in perspective and approach have been the subject of scholarly discussions, which have proposed alternative analyses: see, for example, Trent D Sebbens, ""'Wake, O Wake' Transmission of Business Provisions in Outsourcing and Privatisation"" (2003) 16 Australian Journal of Labour Law 133. This Court is, however, bound to follow PP Consultants and Gribbles , which provide a clear answer in this case."

(b) In these circumstances, by operation of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement were binding on AMRS. Counsel for Mr Urquhart referred to the 1965 Award, 1969 Variations, the National Wage Cases , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement in support of his submission that, whilst employed by AMRS, Mr Urquhart was entitled to be paid wages and superannuation at the rate for which the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement provided, and not at the rate he was in fact paid by AMRS, but with the loading prescribed by the 1998 Award. He referred to the principles for interpreting awards in various cases, including in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (2006) 153 IR 426. He contended that, properly construed, the underpayment that Mr Urquhart claimed in his relief (see [4]) included the loading for which the 1998 Award provided calculated by reference to the 1999 and 2002 certified agreement rates (as well as the difference between the amounts for which these certified agreements provided and that which he was actually paid). 39 AMRS responded that: (a) Powercor's contracting out of the meter reading function did not constitute a transmission of business as meter reading was not Powercor's business, or part of its business. Rather, meter reading was an ancillary function that supported the core business of Powercor, which was to distribute electricity. AMRS also relied on PP Consultants , Gribbles and Stellar Call Centres . AMRS submitted that meter reading was not an essential, or even significant, part of the business of distributing electricity. Nor was it part of the development or maintenance of the assets used to generate electricity, the use of which enabled a fee to be charged to the retailers. AMRS contended that there was a material difference between the metering of electricity use and the reading of meters. This distinction was apparent in each of the outsourcing contracts and in Powercor's distribution licence. (b) If it were wrong in the above submission, then there was no transmission of business to AMRS in 2002 and 2004 as it had already been transmitted to VMM in 1997. Powercor had not, since that time, ""contracted in"" the meter reading function. Hence, at the time of contracting out meter reading to AMRS, Powercor had no meter reading business left to transmit. Alternatively, there was no transmission because, under Powercor's distribution licence and the relevant Codes, Powercor retained the obligations with respect to meters and meter-reading. Further, there was no transfer of assets from Powercor to AMRS. (c) If Powercor's meter reading function constituted its business or part of its business and such business was transmitted to AMRS, then neither the 1998 Award, nor the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement applied to meter readers (such as Mr Urquhart). Therefore, Mr Urquhart was not entitled to be paid in accordance with those instruments. AMRS argued that, even if a generous approach was adopted to the interpretation of the 1998 Award, there was nothing in the 1998 Award that imposed a legal obligation on Powercor to classify, or pay, meter readers under the 1998 Award. Moreover, the history did not disclose that that there was any previous agreement or award relevant to the 1998 Award showing that meter readers were to be covered by the award. Neither the 1999 Agreement nor the 2002 Agreement expressly sets out which Powercor employees were to be covered by these agreements. Rather, by reference to Appendix C in the case of the 1999 Agreement and Appendix D in the case of the 2002 Agreement, each instrument sets out rates of pay within the structure of a 30-point pay scale. In the absence of express provision, AMRS contended that it was proper to consider the industrial and statutory context surrounding the Agreements. This required attention to the objective facts. AMRS argued that the translation exercise undertaken within Powercor after the 1997 Agreement was not relevant to the construction question. Even if this exercise could be taken into account in construing the 1999 Agreement, at the time of certification of the 1999 Agreement (and the 2002 Agreement), Powercor did not employ any standard meter readers. AMRS submitted that, in the circumstances, it could not be said that, viewed objectively, the pay point classification scheme in the two agreements was intended to cover standard meter readers. AMRS further argued that its approach was supported by the statutory context surrounding the certification of enterprise agreements. AMRS submitted that clause 8.2.2 of the 1998 Award made it clear that the loading of 25% attached to the rates of pay prescribed in the Award and not the rates in the 1999 or 2002 Agreements. 46 In the course of this judgment, their Honours touched on the meaning of the word ""business"" in this context. As their Honours said, to be a ""successor"" (or assignee or transmittee), it is not enough that the new employer pursues the same kind of business as the old: Gribbles at 211. What was meant by the word ""business"" in this context depends on s 149(1)(d) , which ""focuses upon succession, assignment and transmission to or of a business which is identified as the business of an employer"", which ""necessarily directs attention to what it is that the former employer had which is to be described as the 'business' of that employer"": Gribbles at 211. Their Honours went on to say (at 212): The 'business' of an employer may be constituted by a number of different assets, both tangible and intangible, that are used in the particular pursuit, whether of profit (if the 'business' is a commercial enterprise) or other ends ... In the case of a commercial enterprise, identifying the employer's 'business' will usually require identification both of the particular activity that is pursued and of the tangible and intangible assets that are used in that pursuit. The 'business' of an employer will be identified as the assets that the employer uses in the pursuit of the particular activity. It is the assets used in that way that can be assigned or transmitted and it is to the assets used in that way that an employer can be a successor. The new employer may be a successor, assignee or transmittee to or of the business, or part of the business, of an employer who was a party to the relevant industrial dispute if the new employer, having the beneficial use of assets which the former employer used in the relevant pursuit, uses those assets in the same or a similar pursuit. ... Whether the new employer is a successor, assignee or transmittee, will require examination of whether what the new employer has can be described as a part of the former employer's business. In s 149(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act , ""the business or part of the business"" of the former employer which in the present case is Powercor is thus to be characterised by reference to the particular activity that it pursued and the assets that it used in that pursuit. As Stellar Call Centres shows, whether a new employer ""becomes the ... transmittee ... of the whole or a part of the business concerned"", for the purposes of subs 170MB(2) depends on much the same inquiry. 47 Stellar Call Centres applied the reasoning in PP Consultants to an inquiry under ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(1) (which, for present purposes, is in relevantly the same terms as s 170MB(2)). In the Full Court of this Court, Stellar Call Centres challenged the decision of the judge at first instance that, pursuant to ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(1) of the Workplace Relations Act , it was bound by awards and certified agreements binding on Telstra Corporation Ltd (""Telstra""). The question was whether a part of Telstra's business that involved the taking and responding to telephone calls from Telstra's customers had been transmitted to Stellar Call Centres. The Full Court held that there was no such transmission, chiefly because the receiving of the calls from customers were ""activities in support of Telstra's businesses in the telecommunication industry"" but were ""not themselves ... the business or part of the business of Telstra"": see Stellar Call Centres at 311. The Full Court said (at 311): That business can appropriately be characterised as providing telecommunications services to its customers. In the course of conducting that business, Telstra is called upon to respond to enquiries, requests for services and complaints from its customers, including those made by telephone. However, the making of those responses is not a distinct 'part' of Telstra's business within the meaning of s 149(1) , as explained by the High Court, any more than, for example, cleaning undertaken as a necessary aspect of the conduct of a restaurant is a 'part' of the business of the restauranteur. The business of Stellar Call Centres was the provision of telephone answering services. The answering of calls was not, however, a part of Telstra's business; and, accordingly, there was no transmission of that part of Telstra's business."

Case1180,referred to,Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014,"The majority judgment in Gribbles shows that some aspects of the transaction between Powercor and AMRS are more relevant than others to the disposal/enjoyment test. In particular, it must be asked whether the new employer has acquired any of the tangible or intangible assets of the old employer: compare Gribbles at 212. In Gribbles , the majority found that, by the relevant transaction, the new employer did not come to enjoy either the tangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's equipment) or the intangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's goodwill): see Gribbles 214. Further, citing Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014 , the majority also recognised that, while both former and new employers employed the same employees, ""no employee is an asset in the employer's balance sheet to be bought or sold"": Gribbles at 214. Accordingly, the majority concluded that the former employer had not disposed of any part of its business and the new employer was not, therefore, a successor to or of any part of the business of the former employer because ""[a]t no time did [the new employer] enjoy any asset of the [former employer], tangible or intangible, which [the former employer] had used in the pursuit of its business activities"": see Gribbles at 204. This test is substantially identical to that proposed by Callinan J in PP Consultants (at 664) in that his Honour there asked whether there was anything for the new employer ""to sell or otherwise pass on to someone else""."
Case1181,applied,Cabal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 546,"In X v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319 the Full Court considered a situation in which the tribunal had refused to have regard to an applicant for review's diary records of a particular period because they had not been translated. The majority, Gray and Moore JJ, in separate reasons, discussed the obligation of a decision-maker to have regard to untranslated material put before him or her. Gray J referred to the decision of Wilcox, Whitlam and Marshall JJ in Cabal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 546 at [25] . There the Full Court had noted that the tribunal may be under an obligation to obtain a translation of a particular document which was in a foreign language and whose relevance had been explained to the tribunal. However, in Cabal [2001] FCA 546 at [25] the Full Court held that, in general, the tribunal was not required to translate material in a foreign language or to consider large volumes of material whose relevance was not explained and its failure to do so was not a departure from the process of review mandated by the then provisions of the Act, in particular s 414(1). 12 In X v Minister for Immigration 116 FCR at 328 [30] the relevant passages sought to be relied on by X had been translated subsequently and were before the Full Court. In a later case Moore J summarised the effect of the authorities: S14/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1153 (affirmed [2004] FCAFC 171 , although this point was not dealt with by the Full Court). He said at [49] that: ""Circumstances can arise where the failure of a Tribunal to obtain the translation of a document, or at least where it fails to inform the applicant who has furnished the document that it does not propose to rely [on] it because it was not translated and thus deny the applicant an opportunity to explain its contents, will result in a denial of procedural fairness: see X v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319. However generally the Tribunal is not obliged to obtain a translation of documents furnished by the applicant in a foreign language at least in circumstances where the Tribunal ascertains the gist of the material if it is significant: see Cabal v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 546. In the present case the Tribunal asked the applicant, through the interpreter, a series of questions both about the newspaper article and the brother's letter. In so doing it ascertained the gist of each document for the purposes of understanding the way in which the applicant relied on them. Its approach was, in my opinion, unexceptionable."""
Case1182,considered,Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 ,"The appellant argued that this statement indicated that the tribunal had, in effect, created a reversal of the onus of proof or imposed an onus on the appellant to satisfy it that he had not fabricated an account. He referred to Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 555 F-D where O'Connor, Branson and Marshall JJ noted that under the then provisions of the Act, the tribunal would have been mistaken to adopt a procedure which either placed on an applicant an onus of establishing that he was truthful or was based on the assumption that the purpose of the hearing before it was to discover whether the applicant for review was a truthful person.

They are not to be scrutinised in over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons have been expressed. Their Honours emphasised that the Court was not to turn a judicial review of the exercise of jurisdiction by an executive decision-maker into a merits based review. 23 In Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 at 423-424 [67]-[70]; [2000] HCA 1 ; 74 ALJR 405 at 417, McHugh J pointed out that it was quintessentially the function of the tribunal to come to a decision about the credibility of an applicant for review. If one took out of context the statement concerning fabrication, that I have quoted in the credibility section of the tribunal's findings and reasons, it may well fall within the criticism noted in Kopalapillai 86 FCR 555 F-G.

Case1183,referred to,S14/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1153,"In X v Minister for Immigration 116 FCR at 328 [30] the relevant passages sought to be relied on by X had been translated subsequently and were before the Full Court. In a later case Moore J summarised the effect of the authorities: S14/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1153 (affirmed [2004] FCAFC 171 , although this point was not dealt with by the Full Court). He said at [49] that: ""Circumstances can arise where the failure of a Tribunal to obtain the translation of a document, or at least where it fails to inform the applicant who has furnished the document that it does not propose to rely [on] it because it was not translated and thus deny the applicant an opportunity to explain its contents, will result in a denial of procedural fairness: see X v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319. However generally the Tribunal is not obliged to obtain a translation of documents furnished by the applicant in a foreign language at least in circumstances where the Tribunal ascertains the gist of the material if it is significant: see Cabal v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 546. In the present case the Tribunal asked the applicant, through the interpreter, a series of questions both about the newspaper article and the brother's letter. In so doing it ascertained the gist of each document for the purposes of understanding the way in which the applicant relied on them. Its approach was, in my opinion, unexceptionable."""
Case1184,applied,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 ; [2007] HCA 26,"Moreover, in my opinion the absence, even today of any translation of the newspaper articles is significant. There is no evidence to indicate that they had anything in them beyond the point which the tribunal recorded as being made by the appellant, namely that they recorded the existence of Ansar Islam. This provides another reason to refuse relief. The absence of such evidence means that no useful result would ensue from the grant of relief desired by the appellant, since there is no reason to think that a further hearing with translated articles would have provided any further information to which the tribunal could have had regard relevant to its exercise of its functions: see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at 618 [29] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ. 19 The second ground of appeal focused on the way in which the tribunal expressed its reasoning for rejecting the appellant's second factual account. In particular, in its findings and reasons the tribunal reviewed each of the six matters it had raised with the appellant in its letter of 8 November, determining each of them adversely to him. However, in the course of those determinations the tribunal considered the further explanations and statements made by the appellant at the second hearing. And, on a number of occasions, it modified the harsher view it had explained in its letter as the conclusion to which it was tending at that earlier time. For example, at the second hearing the appellant explained that the account he had given in his interview with the delegate of his dealing with police officers in Pakistan was not different to the account that he had given at the first hearing. The tribunal noted that it later had listened to the tape of the interview with the delegate and found that this partly confirmed the appellant's claim of his dealings with police officers. But, the tribunal came to the view that the inherent improbability of that claim meant that it was not satisfied that the appellant had in fact had the experience that he recounted. 20 Likewise, after the second hearing the tribunal modified its earlier view concerning the appellant's claims about Ansar Islam from not being satisfied that the group existed at all, as recorded in its letter of 8 November, to accepting its existence. But it was not satisfied about the appellant's account of his connection with the group. In particular, the tribunal had noted in its letter of 8 November, as I have set out above, that it found it very difficult to accept that the appellant had not fabricated his story about the group to support a refugee claim."
Case1185,affirmed,SZLSW v Minister of Immigration [2008] FMCA 498,This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court refusing to grant constitutional writ relief to the appellant in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal which affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant the appellant a protection visa: SZLSW v Minister of Immigration [2008] FMCA 498. The appellant was a Pakistani citizen who hailed from the North West Frontier Province. 2 The appellant arrived in Australia in early September 2007 and was detained at the airport because of irregularities perceived with the manner in which he entered. He made an application for a protection visa later in September 2007 and was assisted by the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in doing so. The service continued to represent him up to the time at which the delegate refused his application. He then applied to the tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision with the assistance of a solicitor migration agent. 3 The tribunal held an initial hearing on 6 November 2007 in which a number of concerns with the claims made by the appellant were discussed. At that hearing the tribunal informed the appellant that it would write to him about issues of concern it had raised with him at the hearing and would give him the option either to provide a written submission or to have another hearing at which he could respond or comment on the issues of concern. On 8 November 2007 the tribunal wrote to the appellant confirming those options. The letter outlined detailed issues under six separate headings relating to issues that concerned the tribunal arising from his evidence at the first hearing. The appellant's solicitor migration agent responded advising the tribunal that the appellant wished to attend a further hearing. The tribunal then invited him to do so.

Case1188,considered,X v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319,"In X v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319 the Full Court considered a situation in which the tribunal had refused to have regard to an applicant for review's diary records of a particular period because they had not been translated. The majority, Gray and Moore JJ, in separate reasons, discussed the obligation of a decision-maker to have regard to untranslated material put before him or her. Gray J referred to the decision of Wilcox, Whitlam and Marshall JJ in Cabal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 546 at [25] . There the Full Court had noted that the tribunal may be under an obligation to obtain a translation of a particular document which was in a foreign language and whose relevance had been explained to the tribunal. However, in Cabal [2001] FCA 546 at [25] the Full Court held that, in general, the tribunal was not required to translate material in a foreign language or to consider large volumes of material whose relevance was not explained and its failure to do so was not a departure from the process of review mandated by the then provisions of the Act, in particular s 414(1). 12 In X v Minister for Immigration 116 FCR at 328 [30] the relevant passages sought to be relied on by X had been translated subsequently and were before the Full Court. In a later case Moore J summarised the effect of the authorities: S14/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1153 (affirmed [2004] FCAFC 171 , although this point was not dealt with by the Full Court). He said at [49] that: ""Circumstances can arise where the failure of a Tribunal to obtain the translation of a document, or at least where it fails to inform the applicant who has furnished the document that it does not propose to rely [on] it because it was not translated and thus deny the applicant an opportunity to explain its contents, will result in a denial of procedural fairness: see X v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319. However generally the Tribunal is not obliged to obtain a translation of documents furnished by the applicant in a foreign language at least in circumstances where the Tribunal ascertains the gist of the material if it is significant: see Cabal v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 546. In the present case the Tribunal asked the applicant, through the interpreter, a series of questions both about the newspaper article and the brother's letter. In so doing it ascertained the gist of each document for the purposes of understanding the way in which the applicant relied on them. Its approach was, in my opinion, unexceptionable."""
Case1189,referred to,Australian &amp; International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited (ACN 009 661 901) [2008] FCA 1972,"23 December 2008, I delivered reasons for judgment in this proceeding, published as Australian &amp; International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited (ACN 009 661 901) [2008] FCA 1972. On that occasion, I ordered that the proceeding be listed on a date to be fixed, for further hearing on the outstanding issues referred to in those reasons for judgment. I also directed the parties to bring in minutes of orders reflecting the conclusions reached in the reasons for judgment. The matter has been fixed for hearing today to deal with the questions identified in those reasons for judgment. Those questions were identified at [129] of the reasons for judgment as: When the matter came before me today, counsel for the respective parties provided me with short minutes of order, to which they both consent. The only orders sought are:"
Case1190,referred to,Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v The Australian Workers Union [2004] HCA 40 (2004) 221 CLR 309,"to the first of those issues a number of considerations are relevant. In any event, in the consideration of penalty, there were undoubtedly substantial mitigating circumstances in the present case. An important one is that, at the time when the contraventions occurred, both parties had taken the view that the relevant provisions of the certified agreement known as EBA6 were to be regarded, at least potentially, as non-pertaining provisions, and therefore were to be removed from the succeeding agreement (EBA7) by agreement of the parties, in order to ensure the certification of EBA7. The concern about whether those provisions pertained to the relevant employees of Qantas arose as a result of the judgment of the High Court in Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v The Australian Workers Union [2004] HCA 40 (2004) 221 CLR 309. The fact that the applicant, a union, was the effective recipient of a benefit from the operation of those provisions apparently caused both parties to assume that they might be non-pertaining provisions. This resulted in the agreement to remove the provisions from EBA7, to ensure the certification of that agreement. In the event, in my reasons for judgment delivered on 23 December 2008, I held that the provisions were enforceable and that breaches of them had occurred. The breaches occurred in the last days of the operation of EBA6. The employees concerned had already approved by ballot in accordance with the Workplace Relations Act the terms of EBA7, from which the supposed non-pertaining provisions had been removed. Application had been made to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to certify the new agreement. The hearing of that application had been adjourned at the request of the applicant, with the agreement of the respondent, because the applicant's new office-bearers had just taken office. One of the contraventions, the failure to pay Captain Woods his entitlement to salary calculated at the rate applicable to the president of the applicant under the agreement, was simply the result of neglect. The evidence, and the finding that I made, was that the normal process was to pay in arrears at the end of a future pay period but that was never done in Captain Woods' case. As for the other contraventions, they involved failure to release two pilots from their duties in accordance with the provisions of EBA6, to enable them to attend to the applicant's business. The refusal to release them from duties arose principally from a failure to understand the significance of the expression, ""operational requirements,"" in the relevant provisions and to distinguish operational requirements from inconvenience in managing the pilots' roster. As a consequence, it can truly be said that neither of the contraventions was wilful. Each was explicable and the degree of culpability of the respondent is substantially mitigated by that. As for general deterrence, the mitigating factors are such that little purpose would be served by imposing a financial penalty. It certainly is not the case that, in every situation a party can insist on a construction of a provision of an award or certified agreement, later found to be unsustainable, and avoid the imposition of a financial penalty. Nevertheless there are cases where the adoption of a construction that is fairly open permits a court to say that the imposition of a financial penalty would not be appropriate. The special feature of this case is that both parties at the relevant time had taken the position that the relevant provisions of EBA6 were not legally enforceable, because they were non-pertaining pursuant to the Electrolux judgment. In those circumstances, it seems to me, that no purpose of general deterrence would be served by the imposition of a financial penalty. For those reasons the agreement of the parties that no financial penalty is any longer appropriate falls within the proper range to which the Court should have regard in determining issues of penalties. Accordingly, I propose to impose no financial penalty in respect of any of the relevant breaches. The parties are, of course, agreed as I suggested they needed to be, that the respondent is obliged to pay Captain Woods the amount of his underpayment and interest on that amount. Those orders will be made. As I have also said, neither party seeks to visit the question of costs, so that no order for costs will be made, on the assumption that the general rule applies that a proceeding in a matter arising under the Workplace Relations Act does not attract costs. There remains the question of the declarations. I have in the past taken the view, to which I adhere that it is generally inappropriate, to make declarations that do no more than record the findings or conclusions the Court reaches on issues of fact and law in any particular case. I have recognised in the past that, particularly under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), there has grown up a practice of making declarations which express findings as to contraventions of various provisions. My own view is that that practice is unfortunate, because the declarations so made do not amount to true declarations of right, pursuant to s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). A true declaration of right provides the parties with a determination of some controversy on which they can base their future relationships. In the present case, the declarations proposed would at least have the effect of expressing the conclusion that the provisions concerned were enforceable at law. Despite Electrolux , they were not non-pertaining provisions, and were therefore binding on the parties and ought to have been complied with, not only in respect of the particular pilots but in respect of all others. For those reasons I am prepared to depart from my usual antipathy towards declarations and to make orders in the terms sought. The orders I make are as follows: The Court declares that: 1. By failing to pay Captain Ian Woods his salary at the rate calculated in accordance with cl 24.2 of the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew (Long Haul) Certified Agreement 2003-2004, in respect of the period from 7 to 15 November 2005, the respondent contravened cl 46.2, coupled with cl 46.6.1 of the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew (Long Haul) Certified Agreement 2003-2004. 2. By refusing to release Captain Simon Tuma from his allocated flying duties on 8 November 2005, the respondent contravened cl 45.3.1(a) of the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew (Long Haul) Certified Agreement 2003-2004. 3. By refusing to release Captain Ian Smith from his allocated flying duties on 11 November 2005, the respondent contravened cl 45.3.1(a) of the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew (Long Haul) Certified Agreement 2003-2004. The Court orders that: The respondent pay to Captain Ian Woods the sum of $1,385.83 (less any applicable tax). The respondent pay to Captain Ian Woods interest on the sum referred to in para 4 above, in the amount of $501.92. 6. Otherwise, the application be dismissed, with no order as to costs. I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gray.

Case1191,referred to,AIPA &amp; Anor v Qantas Airways [2008] FMCA 1008 (2008) 176 IR 453,"were, and are, no prior findings of any relevant contravention of the certified agreement concerned. During the time that my judgment was reserved in this case, the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia imposed a financial penalty on the respondent, at the suit of the applicant, in AIPA &amp; Anor v Qantas Airways [2008] FMCA 1008 (2008) 176 IR 453. In that proceeding the learned federal magistrate found that the respondent had committed three breaches of clauses of EBA7, unrelated to the clauses of EBA6 that were in issue in the present case. The federal magistrate imposed a penalty in respect of the three breaches regarded as arising out of a single course of conduct, of $5,000 whereas the maximum penalty is $33,000. In doing so, at [84], his Honour expressed the view that the breaches were not particularly severe. They concerned conduct subsequent to the conduct in issue in the present case and the judgment was delivered while judgment in the present case was reserved. The respondent has appealed from the federal magistrate's judgment and it is apparent from the notice of appeal that there is a substantial argument about the proper construction of the provisions concerned. Accordingly, the weight of the findings made by the federal magistrate, in considering parallel conduct by the respondent for present purposes, is minimal. In those circumstances and in the light of the applicant's change of position about seeking financial penalties, it is necessary for me to consider the questions of specific and general deterrence. It is apparent that there is no need for specific deterrence in the present case. There is no indication at all that the respondent has ever had an attitude of turning its back on the relevant provisions of certified agreements. There is no occasion for teaching it the lesson that it must have regard to such provisions at all times and must comply with them. Indeed, on the evidence that emerged in the course of this case, it is undoubtedly the fact that the respondent devotes a substantial amount of its resources to ensuring that it complies with certified agreements on a daily basis."

In that case the Full Court at 44 approved a statement by Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 where his Honour said that: ' 18 The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the Tribunal has sufficiently raised a relevant issue that the Tribunal should have dealt with.' 45 The Full Court in NABE went on to say at 44: 'This does not mean that the Tribunal is only required to deal with claims expressly articulated by the applicant. It is not obliged to deal with claims which are not articulated and which do not clearly arise from the materials before it.' 46 The appellants' case was based upon a claim of political persecution. Whilst the Tribunal found that a number of threats had been made by particular persons, some of whom were politicians, it found that the motivation for the persecution was a desire to protect 'their own business interests from competition'. There was evidence to support that finding. 47 In any event, the Tribunal found that the threats did not amount to serious harm within the meaning of s 91R of the Act. In view of the fact that the Tribunal rejected the appellants' claim that the senior political figure visited his home and carried out the threats and the attack on his father-in-law, such a finding was open to the Tribunal."

He held that their evidence was information that the applicant gave for the purposes of the application. That decision is inconsistent with the remarks of Lee J (agreed to by Tamberlin J; Dowsett J dissenting) in the later decision of the Full Court in Applicant M164/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 16.

Case1210,cited,Metcash Trading Limited v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16,"Metcash Trading Limited v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 I concluded that there could be no reasonable doubt that Mr Bunn's conduct in publishing the nine allegations contained in three publications particularised in the Statement of Charge was deliberate and that, in making the allegations that he did, he disobeyed the restraint imposed upon him by Order 3.5(c) of Lander J made in this matter on 9 March 2006. I adjourned further consideration of the present motion to permit the parties to put on evidence and make submissions in relation to penalty. The applicant, Metcash, has filed further affidavit material. That affidavit outlines in some detail correspondence and other communications between Metcash and Mr Bunn which it is said were intended to bring home to Mr Bunn the effect of Lander J's orders; such concerns as Metcash had about Mr Bunn's continuing to publish criticisms of it; and its encouragement for him to obtain legal advice. The affidavit further provided some evidence of Mr Bunn's assets, at least as revealed in a property search in the Australian Capital Territory and from Mr Bunn's Statement of Affairs in his bankruptcy. Mr Bunn is an undischarged bankrupt having lodged a debtor's petition on 26 April 2006. Put shortly, what Metcash now seeks in its submissions is that Mr Bunn be ordered: (1) to pay a fine in the sum of not less than $5,000; (2) to pay the applicant's costs of the contempt application on an indemnity basis; and (3) provide a written apology to the Court for publishing what are described as the Contempt Publications. Mr Bunn has filed no affidavit and has not provided any written submissions in this matter. The character that I ascribed to Mr Bunn's contempt in my earlier reasons was as follows at [47]: ... I am not satisfied that Mr Bunn consciously and deliberately breached the order. His conduct nonetheless has been censurable. While he may not have understood the true meaning of Order 3.5(c) and hence that his conduct could constitute a breach of that order: cf Microsoft Corporation, at 143; his ignorance could provide him with no ready vehicle for exculpation. He knew he was bound by Court orders and that they precluded him from publishing or republishing certain allegations. After his exchange with Lander J on 28 February he had reason to know that his understanding of the meaning and effect of Orders 3.2 and 3.5(c) was quite imperfect. If he was to continue to publish matter critical of the Metcash companies without acting in breach of the orders, it was necessary for him to have an informed understanding of what the orders prohibited. Against that background, it was hazardous for him obdurately later to reject without inquiry the assertions about the orders made by the applicants' solicitors. Mr Bunn needed, but on the material before me did not obtain, reasonable and reasoned advice. Put shortly, he had been put on inquiry in circumstances in which it quite properly can be said he assumed the risk that his conduct might be found to be in breach of the orders. His so acting may well be a matter appropriately to be taken into account in relation to any penalty imposed on him. It clearly is the case as Lander J has observed that Mr Bunn has waged a campaign against Metcash which he blames for the collapse of his own business. Even after my decision on 20 January 2009 he again published a further edition of ""T.I.G.A."". In this edition he discussed my reasons and order and the terms of Lander J's interim injunction. The publication included in part the following: Upon Metcash's application to the Federal Court, the Honourable Justice Finn, has found that Peter Bunn is in contempt of those orders, due to 3 (out of 56) TIGA publications, (07/1-2007; 10/1-2007; and 12/2-2007) for which Bunn is responsible. The fact of the matter is that those 3 publications, were either quoting other people, or discussing Metcash's reports as to profit increases, shareholdings, or discussing possible outcomes of Metcash's actions. Justice Finn has made it clear that Bunn, or any publication for which he takes responsibility for, cannot publish any matter which can be implied that Metcash actively and deliberately operate in a manner calculated to prejudice, damage or destroy the business of independent retailers with whom they deal, which ultimately results in the fact that even if Metcash, or its CEO, Andrew Reitzer, make public statements, or other people make public statements, that imply such (ie Metcash puts up their fees to independent retailers), Bunn is not permitted, under the interim injunction, to publish such facts. This means that Bunn is even injucted from publishing certain statements made by Mr Andrew Reitzer himself, during the ACCC hearing into grocery prices, which could be considered that Metcash actively and deliberately operate in a manner calculated to prejudice, damage or destroy the business of independent retailers with whom they deal !!, nor is Bunn permitted to republish statements made by other people regarding Metcash's conduct !! Such an interim injunction flies in the face of free speech, and certainly beggars belief as to the desperation of Metcash to hide its conduct, instead of standing in the public forum and explaining and justifying its own actions which, obviously, Andrew Reitzer and Metcash are not, or cannot, do !! Bunn has stated that he will respect the penalty that the Federal Court issues, but of course Metcash will have to deal, eventually, before the Court, with having to justify the facts of their original claims to the Federal Court so as to obtain the said interim injunction. Metcash has asked me to draw from this a picture of a cunning individual who uses the terms of the injunction itself to in effect publish what the injunction prohibits. This it is contended reveals his culpable frame of mind. For my own part, while the publication again manifests the strength of his hostility to Metcash, it does in my view do no more than, in somewhat inflammatory language, explain the terms of the order and in his view its possible reach. There is, it should be said, a very real question, as Lander J indicated to Mr Bunn over three years ago, as to whether the terms of Order 3.5(c) are probably ""too wide"". I do accept what Mr Bunn has said that he will respect the penalty imposed by the Court and he reiterated in the penalty hearing before me that he respects the Court and its orders. I do not doubt the genuineness of what he says. Further, I should say I do not regard Mr Bunn's actions as deliberately challenging the legitimacy or justice of decisions and orders made by this Court. A fair understanding of the matter would suggest they had more to do with the lamentable state of the relationship of the parties and their mutual mistrust which clearly are contributing significantly to the glacial progression of the matter towards judicial resolution. (3) The nature and circumstances of the contempt I have outlined this in detail in my earlier reasons and simply adopt what I there said. (4) The Contemnor's culpability This, as I have indicated in the paragraph quoted above, is a matter that has concerned me. I do not consider that Mr Bunn has acted contumaciously. Nonetheless, I consider his conduct censurable. In the circumstances a reasonable person would have been put on inquiry as to the proper meaning of Lander J's orders given what Lander J said to Mr Bunn on 28 February 2006, the communications made to him by Metcash's legal advisers and, at least by his own admission, what he said was the advice of his pro bono lawyers when he discontinued his motion to have Order 3.5(c) varied. It is for this reason, whatever his misapprehension about the meaning of the order, he cannot rely upon that misapprehension to exculpate himself from the imposition of a fine. (5) The deterrent effect It is now clear at last from the publication made after my earlier judgment, that Mr Bunn appears clearly to understand what the order means. It equally seems now to be apparent to him why Lander J ventured the view that Order 3.5(c) may be too wide. Be this as it may and in light of Mr Bunn's comments to me during the hearing, I do not apprehend that he will again act in breach of the order notwithstanding the strength of his animus against Metcash as again revealed in his 2009 T.I.G.A. publication. I am equally satisfied he is well aware of the severe consequences that are likely to ensue should he so act again. Conclusion I am satisfied that in all the circumstances, while a penalty by way of fine should be imposed upon Mr Bunn, it ought not be one of significant magnitude. I have determined that a fine of $2,000 ought be imposed upon him. This, I consider, is both appropriate in the circumstances and reflects my appreciation of the relative gravity of the contempt.

Case1215,cited,Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd v Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees' Union (No 2) (1987) 15 FCR 64,"is well accepted, the power to award costs in all proceedings is discretionary.

However, there is no general principle or rule of law in contempt cases to this effect: see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 at [6] ; and see generally Dal Pont, Law of Costs (2 nd ed, 2009) at [16.65]. As was observed by Moore J in the BHP Steel case at [8] ""in a significant number of cases where indemnity costs have been awarded in contempt proceedings, there is a link between the award of indemnity costs and the penalty for contempt. Costs can be explicitly awarded in substitution for or in lieu of a monetary or other penalty"". In the present matter as I have indicated I intend to impose what I regard as being a reasonable and adequate pecuniary penalty. I take that matter into account in my consideration of an appropriate costs order. While I have indicated that Mr Bunn's conduct is serious, I do not however regard this matter as one involving significant public interests. It is very much a matter inter partes . In saying this I should acknowledge that Metcash ultimately had to resort to contempt proceedings to secure compliance with a Court order. I nonetheless do not consider the present to be an appropriate proceeding in which to make an indemnity order notwithstanding that one justification advanced for such an order is that the bringing of such proceedings should not result in a party being further prejudiced: see eg Concrete Constructions , at 86. The present is a complex litigation in which there is quite obvious antagonism between the parties. I mean no disrespect in saying that Metcash has fought the matter with considerable vigour as is reflected in the volume of material that has been placed before me. I am not satisfied that, in addition to paying a fine, Mr Bunn should properly be called upon to pay the full costs of the considerable forces arrayed, and of the material presented, against him. An appropriate order in the circumstances in my view would be that the usual order be made and that Mr Bunn pay Metcash's costs on a party and party basis and that the costs be taxable forthwith.

Case1217,cited,Henderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1970) 119 CLR 612,"applicant says that in ""timing"" cases such as those presented by the 1992 and 1994 years, a taxpayer can object to an assessment on the basis that it is too low. Reliance is placed on Henderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1970) 119 CLR 612 at 646 per Barwick CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed. The applicant points out that objections in relation to the 1992 and 1994 years are before the Court in relation to an issue other than those involved in this application to amend. The amendment application is filed in all proceedings on foot, including those for the 1992 and 1994 years. Section 67(2) of the Act empowers the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time to give effect to a decision on a review or appeal. If the applicant is successful in its contention that amounts should be excised from its assessable receipts in the 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1996 years, the Commissioner will in my view have power under s 67(2) to amend the assessments for 1992 and 1994 by increasing the assessable receipts for those years. The Commissioner raised a technical obstacle to the course described in [36]. This was that as matters stand at present there is simply an application for leave to add an additional ground. Until the objections are actually amended, so that the issue for the 1992 and 1994 years are in fact before the Court, the prejudice to the Commissioner cannot be avoided. In order to assuage the Commissioner's concern, Counsel for the applicant proffered an undertaking that the issue will be brought before the Court so that an order under s 67(2) can be made. I accept that undertaking."
Case1218,applied,Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146,"Commissioner's complaint is as to the unexplained delay between the applicant's receipt of the 1997 assessment in August 2000 and Mr Leyden's discovery in May 2007. It is true, as the Commissioner maintains, that as an organisation (ie apart from Mr Leyden's explanation), the applicant has been guilty of serious delay. However, when Mr Leyden discovered the true position, he acted promptly to alert the Commissioner to the ""new point"" and seek his consent to raise the new grounds. As has often been said, an application for leave to amend is not the occasion for punishing a party for its delay in making the application. See Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146 at 155. This is very complicated litigation with many difficult issues spread over several tax years. While the delay is unfortunate, it is not of an order that should prevent all live issues between the parties being resolved in the one proceeding. I will grant leave to add the grounds the subject of pars 1 to 3 of the proposed minutes of orders handed up by the applicant.

Case1219,cited,Mikasa (NSW) Pty Limited v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617,"A question then arises as to whether a substantial purpose among any other purpose of carrying on the commercial activities of Australia Post satisfies s 7(4) of the FOI Act for the purposes of Part II of Schedule 2 thus rendering Australia Post exempt from the operation of the FOI Act in relation to the list for the purposes of s 7(2) of the FOI Act. In Mikasa (NSW) Pty Limited v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617, the High Court was called upon to consider the proper construction for the purposes of s 66B(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1965 1971 (Cth) of the phrase 'for the reason that' in the context of a provision of that Act in terms that 'a person (in this section called 'the supplier') engages in the practice of resale price maintenance if ... (d) the supplier withholds the supply of goods to a second person for the reason that the second person [has engaged in a particular conduct including withholding supply of goods]'. Although the context will, of course, influence the construction to be adopted in any particular given case having regard to the provisions of the Act as a whole, Barwick CJ made this observation at page 634: In my opinion, it is not correct to so emphasise the participle in the phrase ""for the reason that"" as to interpret the paragraph as requiring the withholding of the supply to be for one reason only. In my opinion, if the likelihood that the would be purchaser would sell at less than the specific price is an operative reason for withholding that supply, the supplier engages in the practice of resale price maintenance, however many other reasons the supplier may in fact have for not supplying the goods; it is enough if it is an operative reason, that is to say, a substantial reason in the totality of reasons for the withholding of supply. [emphasis added] 45 The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (as amended) ultimately adopted provisions which expressly dealt with consequences in terms of the prescriptions in the Act of conduct engaged in for a purpose and whether, in the case of multiple purposes, the prescribed purpose was a substantial purpose. The remarks of the Chief Justice are directed to the general import of the construction to be given to the phrase 'for the reason that'. In Mikasa , Walsh J also took the view that the phrase 'for the reason that' ought to be construed to mean 'a substantial and operative reason' for withholding supplies (page 646). At page 658 of Mikasa , Stephen J said this: ... common experience suggests that decisions (at least of that nature) have lying behind them a process of decision-making involving the conscious or unconscious weighing of numerous factors, each no doubt of varying weight but each distinct from the others. In such a context each substantial and proximate reason will in my view answer the description of ""the reason"" in this paragraph. [emphasis added]"
Case1220,cited,National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13,"In National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13 ( 'National Mutual' ), Gibbs J considered the meaning of the phrase 'for the purpose of producing assessable income' in s 88(1) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936 1963 (Cth) in a provision which said, 'where a taxpayer has paid any premium in respect of land, premises or machinery used for the purpose of producing assessable income and in the year of income [certain events occurred] a proportionate part of the amount of that premium ... shall be an allowable deduction'. Gibbs J at page 18 said this: The question then is whether the words ""used for the purpose of producing assessable income"" in s 88(1) and (2) on their proper construction apply to land ... only when it is solely used or chiefly used for the purpose of producing assessable income. The section itself contains no words restricting its operation in that way. If the provisions are literally construed, they apply when the land is used for the purpose of producing some assessable income even though it is used for other purposes as well. No doubt the application of the section might be excluded if the use of the land for the purpose of producing assessable income was so insubstantial as to call for the application of the principle de minimis non curat lex , but it is unnecessary to consider that situation ... [emphasis added] 47 In National Mutual , at page 22, Gibbs J said this: I conclude that the words of s 88 should be given the broad meaning which, in their ordinary and natural sense, they are capable of bearing, and should be understood as including a reference to land which has in fact been used for the purpose of producing assessable income whether or not that was the main use of the land.

Case1225,cited,Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510,"First, in my view Mr Bickford correctly stated the process by which the Tribunal was required to reach its decision: namely to achieve, on the evidence presented by the appellant, a state of satisfaction as to whether the payment of the fee required by the regulations had caused, or was likely to cause, severe financial hardship to the appellant. This approach is consistent with the approach required of the Tribunal in reaching other decisions under the Migration Act : cf, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 and Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510. The appellant does not bear an onus to satisfy the Tribunal that the fee should be waived (cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH [2006] HCA 53 ; (2007) 231 ALR 340 at 351) however it is clear that it is for the appellant to advance whatever evidence or argument she wishes to advance in support of her claim: cf Abebe 197 CLR at 576, cf re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, ex parte Cassim [2000] HCA 50 at [9] ."

Case1228,considered,Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223,"In relation to the first ground of appeal, in summary the appellant submitted the following: &#8226; in relation to the reason of the decision-maker that the appellant did not provide any evidence of her partner's financial situation: o all the evidence before the decision-maker indicated that the appellant was estranged from her partner and that her partner was not giving her any financial support at all o the delegate, when making the decision to refuse the visa, noted that the appellant advised at interview that she received no financial assistance from her partner, and that the appellant's partner also admitted that he did not financially support the appellant o there was evidence from Centrelink that the Special Benefit paid to the appellant was income tested and only payable to non-residents in circumstances where they have proven extreme hardship and/or have been abandoned by their resident spouse o her partner's financial situation was an irrelevant consideration in circumstances where there was no evidence that the partner had supplied any money to the appellant. &#8226; in relation to the reason of the decision-maker that the appellant had not submitted enough evidence to support a fee waiver request, for example bank statements for the last six months, any credit card statements, evidence of rent paid and any expenses beyond regular living expenses: o irrespective of the decision-maker's policy of requiring applicants to provide, inter alia , bank statements for the last six months, it does not follow that the failure to provide such bank statements can be a relevant consideration unless the decision-maker concludes that the appellant is attempting to mislead the decision-maker o where the only evidence is that the appellant is receiving a Special Benefit and has no money in her bank account, then the failure to provide bank statements for the last six months is an irrelevant consideration. It is not possible for the decision-maker to then conclude that the payment of the fee had not caused nor was likely to cause severe financial hardship o where the appellant does not have a credit card, the failure to provide a credit card statement could not lead to the conclusion that the payment of the fee had not caused nor was likely to cause severe financial hardship o the appellant did provide evidence of rent paid in that she provided her tenancy agreement which set the rent for her premises at $135 per week o in relation to whether the appellant had ""any expenses beyond regular living expenses"", the uncontested evidence is that the appellant was receiving a Special Benefit of $512 per fortnight, and that she had provided a breakdown of her expenses which left no money available for other expenses. &#8226; in relation to the reason of the decision-maker concerning the indication by the appellant that she intended to start work on 18 December 2004: o the evidence indicated that the appellant was a low-skilled worker o her letter to the Tribunal stated ""I will start working on18/12/04 with Ford Recruitment..."" o the only inference that could be drawn from that statement was that she had approached a recruitment agency and could be offered work o the possibility of obtaining low skilled work in the future cannot be a relevant consideration to determine if the payment of $1,400 in one lump sum could cause severe hardship to the appellant. &#8226; the Tribunal failed to perform its statutory function under reg 4.13(4) Migration Regulations and as a result its decision was in excess of jurisdiction because: o once an application for a fee waiver is made the decision maker has to make a decision on whether reg 4.13(4) applies o the decision maker here made no factual findings on which to base the decision o the Tribunal made no adverse finding of credit o the facts before the Tribunal were that the appellant had a bank account with $1.00, was on a Special Benefit, and was not receiving support from her partner o it was accepted by the Department that the appellant was living under proven extreme hardship and/had been abandoned by her resident spouse o there was no evidence supporting a different conclusion. &#8226; the decision was unreasonable in the sense explained in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 at 223-234 &#8226; the power to waive the filing fee is given to the ""Registrar, or a Deputy Registrar, of the Tribunal, or another officer of the Tribunal authorised in writing by the Registrar"". There is no evidence that the Tribunal member was duly authorised. 22 In summary the first respondent submitted the following: &#8226; it is yet to be established whether or not a decision which is unreasonable, in the sense explained in the Wednesbury case, is amenable to review for jurisdictional error in Australia. In any event, the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the conclusion reached by the Tribunal officer was a view which was reasonably open. This is correct and there is no prospect of Wednesbury unreasonableness, even assuming that Wednesbury unreasonableness does provide a separate ground of review &#8226; the primary submissions of the appellant as to the alleged failure of the Tribunal to take into account a relevant consideration, or taking into account an irrelevant consideration which it was bound not to take into account, is in reality an attack on the merits of the decision. There is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in making a wrong finding of fact. It is not the function of a court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion that the legislature has vested in the administrator: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 per Mason J at 39-40 &#8226; the evidence of the estranged partner's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context in which the decision-maker was making his decision. The appellant had applied for a Partner Visa based upon her de facto relationship with the estranged partner &#8226; it is permissible for the Tribunal to develop a form which sets out the matters it regards as relevant, provided the Court is satisfied that they are not clearly irrelevant &#8226; the task of the Tribunal's delegate on the application of the appellant was to achieve, on the evidence presented by the appellant, a state of satisfaction as to whether the payment of the fee required by the regulations had caused, or was likely to cause, severe financial hardship to the appellant. The findings made by the Tribunal's delegate were not only reasonably open on the evidence presented to him but were findings which he was required to make. The appellant's submission to the contrary is without foundation &#8226; whether the decision is a ""good"" decision or not is not the point - the question is whether it is officiated as a jurisdictional error &#8226; the facts of this case are not similar to those in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 where the Full Court held that the Tribunal had disregarded documents that it was otherwise bound to consider if it surmised that it was possible that the documents could have been fabricated &#8226; the evidence of the estranged spouse's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context of an application for a Partner Visa based on a de-facto relationship with the estranged spouse &#8226; there is no statutory obligation to notify the appellant in any particular way, and no suggestion that the letter was not sent to the appellant's authorised recipient at the correct address. Although Mr Donohue may have been the ""authorised officer"" in relation to making the decision within the Regulations, Mr Hajaj was authorised to send the letter containing the decision. Nothing turns on the fact that the name ""Manal Hajaj"" appeared above ""authorised officer"" in letter to appellant &#8226; in relation to the form of notification of the Tribunal's decision to the appellant, Mr Bickford relied on the decision of Kiefel J in Sochorova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 817 where the applicant was before the Tribunal. In that case, although the applicant had previously been represented by solicitors, the hearing was conducted in the presence of the applicant, her brother and an interpreter. The Tribunal attempted to contact the applicant several days after the hearing to inform her of the decision, but was advised by the solicitors that they no longer acted for the applicant, and gave the Tribunal the last known telephone number and address of the applicant. It appears that the Tribunal contacted the applicant's brother by telephone and advised him orally of the decision on 21 August 2001. The applicant claimed that she was not notified of the decision until almost four months later. Kiefel J held that the applicant's brother was not her representative, and that advice to the applicant's brother was not notification to the applicant within the meaning of s 368D of the Migration Act . The applicant was first notified of the decision four months later, when she herself received a copy of the decision of the Tribunal, and that time began to run for an appeal from that point. However her Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, and held that the form of notification did not invalidate the actual decision of the Tribunal itself, because it did not follow either expressly or impliedly from construction of the Migration Act that such a consequence would follow (at [11]) &#8226; the significance of the decision of the Full Court in Braganza [2001] FCA 318 ; 109 FCR 364 is that in that case their Honours held that where an application for review of the Minister's decision and a request for fee waiver are made within the period prescribed by s 347(1) Migration Act , the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the application for review provided that the application to set aside the Minister's decision is valid if made within the prescribed period and the fee is eventually paid or paid within a reasonable time after the waiver application is rejected (in particular at 375). 30 Fourth, I agree with the submission of Mr Bickford that it is yet to be established whether a decision which is unreasonable, in the sense explained in the Wednesbury case, is amenable to review for jurisdictional error in Australia: Andary v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 211 at [28] . (I note further with respect to this point that the High Court refused leave to appeal from the decision in Andary [2003] FCAFC 211: Andary v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA Trans 242). In any event, the finding of the Federal Magistrate that the decision of the Tribunal delegate was one open to him in the circumstances (at [25]) demonstrates that, in the view of Jarrett FM, the decision was not ""unreasonable"". Given that in my view the Tribunal has taken into account relevant considerations in reaching its decision, and has made its decision based on findings supported by probative material, I am not persuaded that his Honour was incorrect."
Case1229,cited,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"Finally, I note again that it is for the appellant to make her case for waiver of the prescribed fee. While it is necessary that the Tribunal's decision be based on findings supported by probative material, or inferences of fact which can reasonably be drawn from such findings of fact (cf Deane J in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 367), as correctly observed by Jarrett FM a finding of fact by the Tribunal against the weight of the evidence (as submitted by the appellant) does not constitute an error of law, let alone jurisdictional error. The material sought by the Tribunal was probative material upon which it would make decisions, and the appellant was on notice from the contents of the application form that the Tribunal placed importance upon receiving that documentary evidence. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that failure to provide relevant material as sought by the Tribunal - even if in the view of the appellant the material would not have added anything to what she had already said in the application form - contributed to a factual scenario where the Tribunal did not achieve a state of satisfaction which favoured the claim of the appellant. Irrespective whether the appellant can substantiate her contention that the facts of this case clearly indicate suggest that financial hardship would be occasioned to the appellant by payment of the fee - and indeed in my view it appears that the appellant was in fact in such financial circumstances that the payment of the fee would cause her severe financial hardship - the fact remains that review of decisions of the Tribunal is limited to questions of jurisdictional error, and not review of the merits of the decision. Second ground of appeal 32 Migration reg 4.13(4) requires a decision as to waiver of the prescribed fee by, inter alia , an ""officer of the Tribunal authorised in writing by the Registrar"". The appellant tendered material from which it was clear, and does not appear now to be in contention, that Mr AV Donohoe is such an authorised officer for the purposes of reg 4.13(4). The letter to the appellant was signed by Mr Manal Hajaj, who is not so authorised under reg 4.13(4). I note from exhibit A1, being a document entitled ""Fee Waiver Recommendation"" dated 15 December 2004, that: &#8226; Mr Hajaj was a member of the ""Fee Waiver &amp; Priority Team"" in the Tribunal &#8226; he had recommended to Mr Donohoe that the review fee for the appellant not be waived for reasons which were identical to those communicated to the appellant by letter from the Tribunal dated 28 January 2005 and &#8226; on 28 January 2005 Mr Donohoe accepted without qualification Mr Hajaj's recommendation and reasons by marking ""Accepted"" and signing the document containing Mr Hajaj's recommendation and reasons. 33 It is clear in these circumstances that a decision was made by an officer authorised within the meaning of reg 4.13(4) - namely Mr Donohoe - that the prescribed fee not be waived in favour of the appellant."
Case1230,cited,Braganza v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 318 ; (2001) 109 FCR 364,"In relation to the second ground of appeal, which was added at the hearing, Mr Boccabella for the appellant submitted in summary as follows: &#8226; in Braganza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 318 ; (2001) 109 FCR 364, the Full Court held that, provided an application for waiver of a prescribed fee had been made within the prescribed period, the Tribunal could hear an application for review even if the waiver of the prescribed fee was refused &#8226; the decision not to waive the prescribed fee was actually made by a person called Mr Donohue rather than Mr Manal Hajaj (who was identified as the Authorised Officer on the letter from the Tribunal dated 28 January 2005) &#8226; no document signed by Mr Donohue and notifying the appellant of the decision not to waive the prescribed fee was actually sent by the Tribunal to the appellant &#8226; documents indicating that Mr Donohue was the actual decision maker were not disclosed to the appellant until the day of the hearing &#8226; the Tribunal was required to send out a letter under the authority of an authorised officer and the appellant then had 14 days to decide whether she could meet the fee waiver or not (TS p 11 ll 35-49 and p 12 ll 1-19) &#8226; it is not possible to tell from the document on which the actual decision-maker, Mr Donohue, indicated his decision, the reasons for that decision.

Case1231,cited,David Jonathon Walsh v Mike Garrett [1998] 473 FCA,"In my view these considerations are relevant to the decision of the Tribunal for the reasons explained by Jarrett FM in his Honour's decision.

The documents specified in the application form were referable to considerations the Tribunal could relevantly take into account in making its decision, as explained by Jarrett FM &#8226; I do not accept the submission of Mr Boccabella that it does not follow that the failure to provide such bank statements can be a relevant consideration unless the decision-maker concludes that the appellant is attempting to mislead the decision-maker. As explained by Jarrett FM, the amount of money the appellant has had in her bank accounts both at and prior to the date of application for waiver is relevant to the decision whether payment of the fee would cause her financial hardship &#8226; I note the submission of the appellant that she had no credit card, and that a failure to provide a credit card statement could not lead to the conclusion that the payment of the fee would not cause her financial hardship, however at best any error of the Tribunal in relation to this issue is an error of fact which would not of itself constitute a jurisdictional error of the Tribunal in reaching its decision in these circumstances: NAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 76."

This approach is consistent with the approach required of the Tribunal in reaching other decisions under the Migration Act : cf, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 and Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510.

The appellant's submission to the contrary is without foundation &#8226; whether the decision is a ""good"" decision or not is not the point - the question is whether it is officiated as a jurisdictional error &#8226; the facts of this case are not similar to those in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 where the Full Court held that the Tribunal had disregarded documents that it was otherwise bound to consider if it surmised that it was possible that the documents could have been fabricated &#8226; the evidence of the estranged spouse's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context of an application for a Partner Visa based on a de-facto relationship with the estranged spouse &#8226; there is no statutory obligation to notify the appellant in any particular way, and no suggestion that the letter was not sent to the appellant's authorised recipient at the correct address.

Nothing turns on the fact that the name ""Manal Hajaj"" appeared above ""authorised officer"" in letter to appellant &#8226; in relation to the form of notification of the Tribunal's decision to the appellant, Mr Bickford relied on the decision of Kiefel J in Sochorova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 817 where the applicant was before the Tribunal. In that case, although the applicant had previously been represented by solicitors, the hearing was conducted in the presence of the applicant, her brother and an interpreter. The Tribunal attempted to contact the applicant several days after the hearing to inform her of the decision, but was advised by the solicitors that they no longer acted for the applicant, and gave the Tribunal the last known telephone number and address of the applicant. It appears that the Tribunal contacted the applicant's brother by telephone and advised him orally of the decision on 21 August 2001. The applicant claimed that she was not notified of the decision until almost four months later. Kiefel J held that the applicant's brother was not her representative, and that advice to the applicant's brother was not notification to the applicant within the meaning of s 368D of the Migration Act . The applicant was first notified of the decision four months later, when she herself received a copy of the decision of the Tribunal, and that time began to run for an appeal from that point. However her Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, and held that the form of notification did not invalidate the actual decision of the Tribunal itself, because it did not follow either expressly or impliedly from construction of the Migration Act that such a consequence would follow (at [11]) &#8226; the significance of the decision of the Full Court in Braganza [2001] FCA 318 ; 109 FCR 364 is that in that case their Honours held that where an application for review of the Minister's decision and a request for fee waiver are made within the period prescribed by s 347(1) Migration Act , the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the application for review provided that the application to set aside the Minister's decision is valid if made within the prescribed period and the fee is eventually paid or paid within a reasonable time after the waiver application is rejected (in particular at 375). 27 Second, principles with respect to relevant considerations are well-known, and include that the ground of failure to take into account a relevant consideration can only be made out if a decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration which he or she is bound to take into account in making that decision; that the factors a decision-maker is bound to consider in making a decision is determined by construction of the statute conferring a power or discretion; that not every consideration that a decision-maker is bound to take into account but fails to take into account will justify the court setting aside the impugned decision and ordering that the discretion be re-exercised according to law; and that the limited role of the court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind, so that generally it is for the decision-maker and not the court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising the statutory power (Mason J in Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 39-41). Leaving aside for the moment issues relevant to the validity of the communication of the Tribunal's decision to the appellant (to which I will refer below), in this case the letter dated 28 January 2005 from the Tribunal to the appellant made known its reasons to the appellant for decision as being: &#8226; failure of the appellant to submit enough evidence to support a fee waiver request, for example bank statements for the last six months, any credit card statements, evidence of rent paid and any expenses beyond regular living expenses &#8226; failure of the appellant to provide any evidence of her partner's financial situation &#8226; the indication by the appellant in her correspondence to the Tribunal that she intended to start working on 18 December 2004."

Case1238,cited,Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 218 ALR 733,"In relation to these grounds Jarrett FM found in summary: 1. The conclusion that the Tribunal officer came to in his reasons for decision was that he was not satisfied that the onus upon the appellant had been discharged by her, which was a view that the Tribunal officer was entitled to take. Further, even if it were the case that the Tribunal officer's finding was against the weight of the evidence before him or her, and might be said to be a perverse finding of fact, it did not amount to an error of law, let alone jurisdictional error [25]-[26]. His Honour referred to comments of Kirby J in Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 218 ALR 733 at [67] in relation to this proposition. 2. In relation to alleged irrelevant considerations: a. the appellant's partner's financial circumstances was not an irrelevant consideration; b. in a decision that concerns the capacity of the appellant to pay a fee, her assertions as to her employment status, either at the time of the application or soon thereafter, were plainly relevant. 15 Accordingly, his Honour dismissed the application. 16 There are two grounds of appeal before the Court. 17 First, in her notice of appeal filed 29 August 2006 in this Court, the appellant claimed that ""the Federal Magistrate failed to find a jurisdictional error when the initial decision by the Tribunal was made with jurisdictional error"". As of 29 August 2006 the reasons for decision of Jarrett FM had not been made available, and the solicitors for the appellant indicated that particulars of the error of jurisdiction would be provided at a later date. The appellant subsequently provided the following particulars: &#8226; ""The Federal Magistrate erred in not deciding that the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable. &#8226; All the evidence before the Tribunal was that the appellant was penniless. &#8226; The Tribunal found that because the appellant had not complied with a non-regulatory policy through not producing a specific set of documents (not required by regulation) that she was therefore not going to suffer severe financial hardship as a result of paying the filing fee (of $1,400). (The list of documents in the policy does not even purport to be an exhaustive list). &#8226; In the circumstances, the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable. &#8226; In this regard, the Federal Magistrate, in paragraph 25 of the reasons, justified the decision of the Tribunal by simply stating that the Tribunal has determined that the review applicant (the appellant) had not discharged her onus of proof. &#8226; But the Tribunal did not dismiss the appellant's application for a fee waiver because she failed to discharge any onus of proof, the Tribunal went impermissibly further by stating that the absence of certain documents meant that the Tribunal could make an actual finding that the review applicant would not suffer severe financial hardship. &#8226; Further the Tribunal took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely the absence of evidence of the estranged spouse's financial circumstances yet there was no finding either at the primary (Department) level or at the Tribunal stage that there was any financial support from the estranged spouse and no evidence that the appellant was in a position to provide evidence of the financial circumstances of the estranged spouse. &#8226; The Tribunal failed to perform its statutory function under reg 4.13(4) Migration Regulations and as a result its decision was in excess of jurisdiction."" 18 Second, at the hearing before me, Mr Boccabella for the appellant sought leave to add a further ground of appeal based on s 347(1) of the Act, which provides that an application for review of an MRT-reviewable decision must be in approved form, given to the Tribunal within the prescribed period, and be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any). This ground of appeal is that the appellant has not been given proper notice of a decision, and is entitled to a reasonable period after proper notice has been given (which has not yet occurred) to have an opportunity to pay the prescribed fee."

If the letter purported to be from the actual decision-maker, who was an authorised officer within the meaning of Migration reg 4.13, it should have been drafted in such terms that it be from Mr Donohue himself. However, notwithstanding this irregularity with respect to the manner in which the decision was communicated to the appellant, in my view the validity of the decision itself is not compromised. A decision that the prescribed fee not be waived was made by a person authorised to do so in the Tribunal. The Tribunal communicated that decision to the appellant. My attention has been directed to no provisions in the Migration Act which require the decision of an authorised person to be communicated to the appellant by that authorised person. I agree with the submission of Mr Bickford that an analogy may be drawn with the decision of Kiefel J in Sochorova [2002] FCA 817 to the effect that that such a consequence does not follow either expressly or impliedly from construction of the Migration Act . 38 As Mr Boccabella submitted, the facts before the Tribunal pointed to the appellant being of very limited financial means, and a person for whom payment of the prescribed fee would cause severe financial hardship. However whether payment of the fee would cause the appellant severe financial hardship was a decision for the Tribunal on the facts and material before it. In the absence of jurisdictional error, the decision cannot be disturbed by this Court. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 1. The appeal be dismissed.

The appellant had applied for a Partner Visa based upon her de facto relationship with the estranged partner &#8226; it is permissible for the Tribunal to develop a form which sets out the matters it regards as relevant, provided the Court is satisfied that they are not clearly irrelevant &#8226; the task of the Tribunal's delegate on the application of the appellant was to achieve, on the evidence presented by the appellant, a state of satisfaction as to whether the payment of the fee required by the regulations had caused, or was likely to cause, severe financial hardship to the appellant. The findings made by the Tribunal's delegate were not only reasonably open on the evidence presented to him but were findings which he was required to make. The appellant's submission to the contrary is without foundation &#8226; whether the decision is a ""good"" decision or not is not the point - the question is whether it is officiated as a jurisdictional error &#8226; the facts of this case are not similar to those in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 where the Full Court held that the Tribunal had disregarded documents that it was otherwise bound to consider if it surmised that it was possible that the documents could have been fabricated &#8226; the evidence of the estranged spouse's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context of an application for a Partner Visa based on a de-facto relationship with the estranged spouse &#8226; there is no statutory obligation to notify the appellant in any particular way, and no suggestion that the letter was not sent to the appellant's authorised recipient at the correct address. Although Mr Donohue may have been the ""authorised officer"" in relation to making the decision within the Regulations, Mr Hajaj was authorised to send the letter containing the decision. Nothing turns on the fact that the name ""Manal Hajaj"" appeared above ""authorised officer"" in letter to appellant &#8226; in relation to the form of notification of the Tribunal's decision to the appellant, Mr Bickford relied on the decision of Kiefel J in Sochorova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 817 where the applicant was before the Tribunal. In that case, although the applicant had previously been represented by solicitors, the hearing was conducted in the presence of the applicant, her brother and an interpreter. The Tribunal attempted to contact the applicant several days after the hearing to inform her of the decision, but was advised by the solicitors that they no longer acted for the applicant, and gave the Tribunal the last known telephone number and address of the applicant. It appears that the Tribunal contacted the applicant's brother by telephone and advised him orally of the decision on 21 August 2001. The applicant claimed that she was not notified of the decision until almost four months later. Kiefel J held that the applicant's brother was not her representative, and that advice to the applicant's brother was not notification to the applicant within the meaning of s 368D of the Migration Act . The applicant was first notified of the decision four months later, when she herself received a copy of the decision of the Tribunal, and that time began to run for an appeal from that point. However her Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, and held that the form of notification did not invalidate the actual decision of the Tribunal itself, because it did not follow either expressly or impliedly from construction of the Migration Act that such a consequence would follow (at [11]) &#8226; the significance of the decision of the Full Court in Braganza [2001] FCA 318 ; 109 FCR 364 is that in that case their Honours held that where an application for review of the Minister's decision and a request for fee waiver are made within the period prescribed by s 347(1) Migration Act , the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the application for review provided that the application to set aside the Minister's decision is valid if made within the prescribed period and the fee is eventually paid or paid within a reasonable time after the waiver application is rejected (in particular at 375)."

Subsection 106KD(1A), which provides that 'a draft report must set out the reasons for the preliminary findings' did not come into force until 1 January 2003. It does not apply to the present case see Item 118(1) Schedule 1, Health Insurance Amended (Professional Services Review and Other Matters) Act 2002 (Cth). Section 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), which operates only where there is such a statutory requirement, did not apply to the Draft Report. Dr Mathews' contention to the contrary was rejected in Dimian v Health Insurance Commission [2004] FCA 1615 at [78] [80] per Jacobson J. I agree with his Honour's view. 16 In any event, this ground cannot be sustained because the Draft Report does contain reasons see ground 4 below. 17 Ground 4 is as follows: ' [The Committee] failed to observe procedures that it was required to observe by law (ADJR Act, s 5(1)(b) or 5 (1)(e)), in the making of its Final Report in that it failed to make or set out: (a) Findings or sufficient findings on material questions of fact; and it (b) Failed to refer to the evidence upon which those findings were based (the Act, s 106L and Acts Interpretation Act 1901 , s 25D) and/or it (c) Failed to expose its reasons or sufficient reasons for making its ultimate conclusions.'"

As an expert body, it was entitled and expected to do so: Tankey v Adams [2000] FCA 1089 ; (2000) 104 FCR 152 at [107] ; Minister for Health v Thomson (1985) 8 FCR 213 at 217 and 224."

Case1246,applied,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SBAN [2002] FCAFC 431,"The Committee was required to prepare a Draft Report setting out its preliminary findings subs 106KD(1) of the Act. It was submitted that the fact that those views were unfavourable to Dr Mathews is not, of itself, evidence of bias or pre-judgment: see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SBAN [2002] FCAFC 431 at [11] . That is undoubtedly correct. 32 The Committee discussed Dr Mathews' submissions on the Draft Report in the Final Report at [95] [100]. It declared at [96] that after careful consideration of the submissions, it was not persuaded to change its finding that Dr Mathews engaged in inappropriate practice in relation to the referred services. Dr Mathews characterises his submissions as 'careful, detailed and reasoned' and the amendments which the Committee made in its Final Report as 'grudging and minor', but it was submitted that the use of emphatic language, without more, is unhelpful. It was further submitted that, in essence, Dr Mathews' contention is that a finding of apprehended bias should be made merely because the Committee did not accept the changes to the Draft Report which he proposed. In my view, there is substance in that submission. 33 Dr Mathews selected four examples to demonstrate the alleged pre-judgment. These were summarised in the respondents' written outline of submissions as follows: ' (a) Appendix 1, service no. 4 At the Committee hearing on 30 October 2003 the applicant told the Committee that he referred the patient to an allergy specialist, ordered an IGE test, thinks he performed a spirometry test and that ""the management plan for her was Ventolin."" In the Draft Report the Committee said inter alia that there was insufficient evidence of the development or implementation of an adequate management plan for the patient's presenting problem. The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I do not accept this reason. I referred the patient to an allergy specialist; ordered an IGE pathology test and performed a spirometry test. I had also been prescribing her Ventolin. In my submission that must fall within the range of what is an acceptable management plan. In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (b) Appendix 2, service no. 1 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation. At the Committee's request, he read out his clinical note: ""Vomiting, Promethazine, 4 u.e., urea, electrolytes and creatinine which is in those days I think they were bundled in together with a liver function test in those days I think."" In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that ""At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 40 year old patient presenting with a migraine headache."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I did record a selective history of ""vomiting"". I knew from the visit the previous day that the patient was suffering from migraine. There was a management plan recorded which was to give the patient an injection of Promethazine and I advised her to undergo further tests to check her liver function, kidney function and the state of her hydration."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (c) Appendix 2, service 3 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation. He read out his clinical note: ""FOC, Ceclor CD, Ventolin and Becloforte. In answer to a question about whether he performed a peak-flow reading, he said: ""I did not perform a peak flow reading, it is not written down. I do not know whether I did. Sometimes yes I did but it is not written down there so I do not recall. In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that ""At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 15 year old patient who had a flare up in his chest. No peak flow reading was performed on this young patient who had a history of asthma."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I did record a selective history with my shorthand notation 'FOC'. The patient's history of asthma and smoking was known to me. I did record my management plan which was to prescribe Ceclor for his chest infection; Ventolin and Becloforte for the patient's asthma. The evidence does not indicate that a peak flow reading was not performed and in my submission the Committee cannot make such a finding (see T p 26 line 31 ff)."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (d) Appendix 3, service 15 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that: ""I gave him the Ducene in an attempt to reduce his alcohol consumption and because of the anxiety associated with living with his partner, Christine, who was an invalid. So in a fashion he was a carer, and as I said, his legs he had been my patient for probably 15 years."" The applicant also told the Committee that: ""The presenting complaint with Ron was that he was had massive anxiety because he was worried about Christine and his knees there is a note before approximately 6 or 8 weeks before, that his knees and his lumbar sacral spine, because when Christine fell over he would have to pick her up, and as I said he has I have asked him to have his knees x-rayed many, many times. He has never had it x-rayed. He is non-compliant. In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia: ""No evidence that this service was other than a simple problem requiring minimal input, limited examination and management. In Dr Mathew's oral evidence he stated that he wrote a prescription for Ducene for the pain to damaged knees."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report that: ""I do not agree with this view of the consultation. At T p 49 line 32, I said that I gave Ducene in an attempt to reduce the patient's alcohol consumption, not for pain. My oral evidence indicates that this was not a straightforward consultation having regard to the underlying social problems within the patient's household. The patient's knees have been a matter of ongoing concern for some time."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in its Draft Report.' (Footnotes omitted) 38 Pursuant to subs 106K(3), the Minister made Health Insurance (Professional Services Review Sampling Methodology) Determination 2000 (No. 1) ('the Sampling Determination'), which provides, inter alia : ' Part 1 Preliminary 1 ... 2 ... 3 Purpose This Determination specifies the content and form of a sampling methodology that may be used by a Committee in making findings for an adjudicative referral. 4 Application (1) This Determination applies if the Committee decides, in respect of conduct in connection with rendering or initiating the services included in a particular class of the referred services, to have regard only to a sample of the services included in the class. (2) The sampling methodology in Part 2 applies to: (a) individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of services; and (b) individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of patients. 5 Definitions In this Determination: Act means the Health Insurance Act 1973 . class size , in relation to a sample, means the number of services rendered or initiated in the particular class of referred services from which a sample is chosen. exploratory sample has the meaning given in section 8. final random sample has the meaning given in section 10. preliminary random sample has the meaning given in section 6. Note 1 The following terms that are used in this Determination are defined in subsection 3 (1) of the Act: &#8226; Initiate &#8226; Patient. ... Part 2 Sampling methodology 6 Preliminary random sample In having regard, under subsection 106K (1) of the Act, only to a sample of the services included in a particular class of referred services, a Committee must ensure that the sample (the preliminary random sample ) is a random sample. 7 Appropriate sample size (1) The preliminary random sample must be of an appropriate sample size to enable prediction with 95% confidence that the percentage of services constituting inappropriate practice worked out from the sample is within +/- 10% of the actual percentage of inappropriate services rendered or initiated in the class of referred services sampled, at a hypothesised incidence of inappropriate practice of 50% of services rendered or initiated (the incidence requiring the largest sample). (2) For a class of services specified in a referral, the appropriate sample size of the preliminary random sample is at least: N __________ 1+0.01(N-1) where: N = class size. (3) If the appropriate sample size worked out is not a whole number, it must be rounded up to the next whole number. 8 Exploratory sample In making a finding based on statistical sampling, the Committee must: (a) examine a sample, preferably of 30 or more services (but not less than 25 services) (the exploratory sample ) , randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample; and (b) determine whether or not each of those services constitutes inappropriate practice. 9 Percentage of inappropriate practice in exploratory sample (1) After the Committee has determined which of the services in an exploratory sample constitute inappropriate practice, it must work out the percentage of services in the sample that constitutes inappropriate practice. (2) The percentage must be expressed as a whole number (being, if necessary, rounded down to the nearest whole number). 10 ...' 39 Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of ground 8 as pleaded are not in issue. Paragraph (d) contains the first allegation of error. Dr Mathews contends that the terms of s 6 of the Sampling Determination, in particular the words 'must ensure', when used in relation to the words 'that the sample (the preliminary random sample) is a random sample', effectively requires the Committee to undertake the sampling itself. Alternatively, it is said that if s 6 does not require the Committee to do the sampling itself, it requires the Committee to ensure for itself that a sample of the services, included in a particular class of selected services, is a random sample and that this cannot be satisfied where the Committee merely relies on a list of services of a particular class, derived from a larger list of services of that particular class, 'fed' to them by the Director, even if the Committee has no reason to think that the larger list of services of that particular class is not a random sample. 40 The primary submission can be rejected out of hand. On no construction of s 6 of the Sampling Determination can it be said that it requires the sampling to be carried out by the Committee itself."
Case1247,applied,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"The question which arises is whether this error invalidates the Committee's finding at [2] of its Final Report, namely, that the conduct of Dr Mathews in connection with rendering MBS Item 23, 24 and 193 services that were the subject of Adjudicative Referral 223 was, in the Committee's opinion, unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners and constituted inappropriate practice as defined in s 82 of the Act. In my view it does and for the following reasons: 1. The importance of complying with the sampling methodology in the Sampling Determination is borne out by all the provisions of s 106K of the Act, but in particular the deeming operation of subs 106K(2) and the fact that the Committee is, by subs 106K(4), prohibited from using a sampling methodology that is not specified in a determination made under subs 106K(3), unless it is ordered by a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia that the sampling methodology is statistically valid. 2. The opening words of s 8 of the Sampling Determination make it clear that its requirements are mandatory: 'In making a finding based on statistical sampling, the Committee must ...'. 3. In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, the majority rejected (at 389 391, [92] [93]) the traditional distinction between 'mandatory' and 'directory' requirements, saying that: '[a] better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid'. In determining the purpose of the legislation, regard has to be had to 'the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute'. 4. Nevertheless, having regard to the mandatory terms of s 8 of the Sampling Determination and its importance in the process of statistical sampling upon which the Committee's finding is ultimately made, I am of the view that it is a purpose of the Sampling Determination that a finding made in reliance on an act done in breach of s 8 of the Sampling Determination is an invalid finding: See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 per McHugh J at [72] [73]; per Hayne J at [205]."
Case1248,cited,Public Service Board v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1985) 159 CLR 656,"With respect, I also have difficulty with this ground of review. Indeed, counsel for Dr Mathews accepted that there is no 'general law' requirement that administrative decision-makers must give reasons: Public Service Board v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1985) 159 CLR 656. In that case, it was acknowledged by Gibbs CJ (at 670) and by Deane J (at 676) that there may be 'special circumstances' where natural justice requires reasons to be given, however, only one instance was cited in which 'special circumstances' have been found in the intervening period. This suggests that 'special circumstances' are particularly rare. 24 On behalf of Dr Mathews, it was submitted that the legislative context in the present case gives rise to such 'special circumstances'; the statutory provision regarding the drawing and provision of a draft report and permitting further submissions on it from an applicant would be meaningless unless the reasoning were to be exposed both as a necessary matter of statutory construction and as a matter of procedural fairness to Dr Mathews. Whether or not this is so, it was submitted on behalf of the respondents that the Committee did give reasons in its Draft Report see ground 4 above and it is idle to suggest that an applicant who is able to produce submissions responding to virtually every sentence in the Draft Report was not informed about the reasoning process which the Committee had adopted. I agree with this submission. 25 Ground 5 is as follows: ' [The Committee's] Draft and Final Reports, considered together, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, in that a fair-minded lay-person, properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings and the matters in issue, who is aware of the evidence and submissions in the proceedings, including the further evidence provided by [Dr Mathews] after the hearing, would consider that [the Committee] was biased against [Dr Mathews] , in the sense that their mind was closed to the issues raised by [Dr Mathews] and nothing [Dr Mathews] said after the preparation of the Draft Report could have changed the view that [the Committee] had taken about [Dr Mathews'] case.' 26 The Application contains the following particulars with respect to this ground of review: '(i) Nowhere in the appendices to the Final Report, in which the purported reasons for the material findings were outlined, is there any express acknowledgment of the further written evidence of [Dr Mathews] . (ii) But for formal acknowledgement that the submissions and evidence were received, and several minor modifications, no change to the findings or reasons for findings is made as a result of the further written evidence of [Dr Mathews] . (iii) [Dr Mathews'] oral evidence, accepted with little comment at the hearing, is barely referred to in either the body of the report or the appendices. (iv) [The Committee] failed to undertake its own random sampling in accordance with s 106K of the Act, relying instead on a pool of samples drawn by [HIC] and already examined in detail by the [Director] (in his investigation prior to the Adjudicative Referral) and already found by him (or his officers, servants and agents) to have been sufficiently deficient and/or adverse to [Dr Mathews] to cause him to refer the matter to [the Committee] . The pool was accordingly, no longer a random sample by any definition of that expression.' 27 Dr Mathews submits that the Final Report contains only the most grudging and minor amendments (styled by the Committee as 'clarification' see [98] of the Committee's Final Report), makes no acknowledgement of Dr Mathews' further evidence, and, in the main, ignores Dr Mathews' submissions entirely and is, for those reasons, affected by apprehended bias."

Case1251,applied,Tisdall v Health Insurance Commission [2002] FCA 97,"I agree with the submissions of counsel for the respondents that the Committee treated the deficiencies which it found in Dr Mathews' records as one only of the relevant factors which it took into account when making findings of inappropriate practice in respect of each of the three MBS item services. It did indeed treat adequate record keeping as a component of the clinical input necessary for proper treatment of the patient and that approach is consistent with the approach adopted by this Court in Tisdall v Health Insurance Commission [2002] FCA 97 at [82] where Tamberlin J said: 'It is evident from the language of the Final Report that the Committee did not treat the failure to keep records, for example, in itself sufficient justification to arrive at its findings. Rather, the Committee took this into account as a relevant factor and in my opinion, it was entitled to adopt this approach and to enquire into this matter.' I agree with his Honour's approach. 79 For the foregoing reasons, this ground of appeal cannot be sustained. 80 It follows from the foregoing that the Committee's finding at [2] of its Final Report is invalid because it is predicated upon the Committee's failure to observe the sampling methodology of the Sampling Determination, in particular, the provisions of s 8. In the circumstances, the appropriate declaration and orders are that: 1. The Committee's Final Report be declared invalid. 2. Adjudicative Referral No. 223 be set aside. 3. The matter be remitted to the Director with a direction that he establish a differently constituted committee to determine the reference to Adjudicative Referral No. 223 according to law. 4.

Case1252,applied,Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425,"In relation to this ground, I was referred to what was said by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [28] as to the proper test to be applied for apprehended bias in the case of administrative proceedings held in private. To fully appreciate what their Honours there said, one needs to refer also to the surrounding context of [27] [31] inclusive: ' [27] The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. That formulation owes much to the fact that court proceedings are held in public. There is some incongruity in formulating a test in terms of ""a fair-minded lay observer"" when, as is the case with the tribunal, proceedings are held in private. [28] Perhaps it would be better, in the case of administrative proceedings held in private, to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias. Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation, there is, in our view, no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility, as distinct from probability, as to what will be done or what might have been done. To do otherwise, would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof. [29] Though the test in administrative proceedings, as in curial proceedings, is, in our view, one of objective possibility, the non-curial nature of the body or tribunal in question and the different character of the proceedings must, as already indicated, be taken into account. In the present case, a significant difference between curial proceedings and the proceedings of the tribunal is that the former are adversarial and the parties are usually legally represented, whereas the latter are inquisitorial in nature and the parties are not represented. [30] Where, as in the present case, credibility is in issue, the person conducting inquisitorial proceedings will necessarily have to test the evidence presented -- often vigorously. Moreover, the need to ensure that the person who will be affected by the decision is accorded procedural fairness will often require that he or she be plainly confronted with matters which bear adversely on his or her credit or which bring his or her account into question. Similar questions by a judge in curial proceedings in which the parties are legally represented may more readily give rise to an apprehension of bias than in the case of inquisitorial proceedings. [31] Where, however, parties are not legally represented in inquisitorial proceedings, care must be taken to ensure that vigorous testing of the evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses do not result in the person whose evidence is in question being overborne or intimidated. If that should happen, a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person might readily infer that there is no evidence that the witness can give which can change the decision-maker's view. 29 There is no submission on behalf of Dr Mathews in relation to this ground of apprehended bias that he was overborne or intimidated by vigorous testing of his evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses at the hearing before the Committee such as to lead a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person to infer that there is no evidence he could give which could change the Committee's view. The only basis of this ground is put in terms of [27] supra. 30 It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that Dr Mathews' contention that the Committee ought to have had regard to unspecified 'further evidence' allegedly incorporated in his submissions on the Draft Report should be rejected. It was submitted that while Dr Mathews was entitled to make '... written submissions suggesting changes to the Draft Report ...', he was not entitled to give evidence see subs 106KD(3) of the Act."

Case1257,cited,"Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 , 76 ALJR 966","One Ground of Appeal asserts a failure to accord procedural fairness. Reliance is placed upon Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 , 76 ALJR 966 , a decision which the Appellant maintains is "" identical "" to his own. 21 The Notice of Appeal goes on to state: ... My case is identical to Muin contending a want of procedural fairness in two respects. Muin had been misled into believing that the Tribunal had read some information, which had been in part B documents; and the Tribunal had not drawn to his attention some material adverse to his claims so as to enable him to comment upon them. It is the first of those contentions, which is relevant here. 22 In Muin the applicants had been led to believe that the Tribunal had certain documents -- called the Part B documents -- which had been before the delegate. Those documents were not before the Tribunal. A majority of the High Court concluded that there had been a denial of procedural fairness. Hayne J referred to an agreed statement of facts and concluded: [256] ... The consequence of what has been agreed between the parties to each of the present actions is that each plaintiff was led to believe, by what the Tribunal said, that it had material relevant to that plaintiff's claim which it did not. [257] The agreed facts are silent about whether the Tribunal was aware of the information and opinions contained in the PtB documents. It may have been, but more importantly, it may not. It follows, therefore, that in each case, the plaintiff was denied procedural fairness. Neither plaintiff was given an opportunity to place before the Tribunal the material and submissions which, on the agreed facts, it is accepted that he or she would have submitted if not mistaken about what was before the Tribunal. Moreover, it also follows from the parties' agreement that each plaintiff would have made further submissions and sought to adduce further evidence that the Tribunal did not comply with the statutory provisions governing its conduct of the reviews of the plaintiffs' cases. It did not give each plaintiff the opportunity to make the submissions or give the evidence which the plaintiff wished to make and give. For these reasons, Question 1 of the questions reserved should, in each case, be answered ""yes"". Gummow J (at [171]) and Kirby J (at [194]) agreed with Hayne J. Gaudron J also agreed that there had been a denial of procedural fairness. 23 One difficulty confronting the Appellant in the present proceedings is not the principle for which Muin is authority; the Appellant's difficulty is the application of Muin to the circumstances of the present appeal. 24 The material before the delegate is set forth in his decision dated 11 December 2006. The material that was before the Tribunal is also set forth in its reasons for decision. There was no identification by the Appellant of those documents which he contended should have been before the Tribunal but were not. Generalised assertions as to a denial of procedural fairness and a citation of the decision in Muin does nothing to assist this Court in the resolution of a challenge to a decision of the Tribunal: SZJMU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1344 at [16] per Mansfield J. 25 A further difficulty confronting the Appellant in his reliance upon Muin is the fact that this ground was also not raised before the Federal Magistrate for resolution. Again, it is a ground apparently inserted consequent upon the meeting with the migration agent. Again, leave to raise this as a Ground of Appeal is refused. 36 An instance of such indiscriminate repetition of grounds advanced in other proceedings into the circumstances of the present appeal is, it is considered, exposed by the Appellant's reliance upon the decision in Muin. The documents which were not before the Tribunal in that case and which occasioned the denial of procedural fairness had been there identified as "" the PtB documents "". But there were no comparable documents identified in the present appeal which were said to have been not before the Tribunal and thereby denying the now Appellant of procedural fairness."
Case1258,followed,"Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437","One ground, however, asserts that the Federal Magistrate failed to apply "" the principles laid down by the full court of Federal Court in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 "". 8 Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 was a decision of the Full Court which concerned whether a person was a refugee who could reasonably relocate within his own country. Black CJ, at 440 1, concluded in part as follows: The appellant's primary argument must be rejected. Although it is true that the Convention definition of refugee does not refer to parts or regions of a country, that provides no warrant for construing the definition so that it would give refugee status to those who, although having a well-founded fear of persecution in their home region, could nevertheless avail themselves of the real protection of their country of nationality elsewhere within that country. The focus of the Convention definition is not upon the protection that the country of nationality might be able to provide in some particular region, but upon a more general notion of protection by that country. If it were otherwise, the anomalous situation would exist that the international community would be under an obligation to provide protection outside the borders of the country of nationality even though real protection could be found within those borders. Whitlam J agreed. The conclusions of the Chief Justice were further considered by the High Court in SZATV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 40 at [10] , [2007] HCA 40 ; 237 ALR 634 at 636 per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ. Their Honours there accepted that the basic test is whether it is reasonable, in the sense of being practicable, for a claimant to relocate to a region where objectively there is no appreciable risk of the occurrence of the feared persecution. 13 Leave to raise reliance upon Randhawa is refused. It is a ground which has no substance. 14 A number of grounds assert that the Tribunal failed to consider the claims being advanced. One ground thus asserts that the Tribunal's decision failed to take "" into account the full gravity of my circumstances and consequences of the claim ."" Another ground separately asserts that the "" Tribunal did not take in to account certain relevant consideration or 'integers' central to the applicant's claim "". Other grounds refer to the "" immense and intimidating pressure "" to which the now Appellant was exposed and assert a failure on the part of the Tribunal to consider those matters. 15 A number of answers may be given for rejecting these grounds. 34 In the present proceedings, a number of the Grounds of Appeal are in substantially the same terms as were before Justice Collier in SZINP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747. Those grounds in the present appeal provided (without alteration): 3. The learned Federal Magistrate has dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors contained in the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 4. The Federal Magistrate made a legal, factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down by the full court of Federal Court in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Afairs (1994) 52 FCR 437. 5. The Federal Magistrate failed to take consideration that the Tribunal decision was unjust and was made without taking into account the full gravity of my circumstances and consequences of the claim. ... 11. The Tribunal applied the wrong test: Particulars: a) The Tribunal applied the wrong test, by requiring independent evidence of the fact before the Tribunal would accept a claim being made by the applicant the Tribunal was , in fact , placing high an onus of proof an the applicant and failing to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt. b) The Tribunal left out individual elements of the applicant's claims and tested whether they individually amounted to persecution rather than look at the claim as a whole to determine whether the claim so considered amount to persecution. The grounds as they were expressed in the proceedings before Collier J differed to the extent that those grounds did not refer to the Magistrate as being "" learned "" and did not refer to the decision in Randhawa as being a decision of the Full Court or the citation to that decision. There is not much other difference between these grounds in the present proceedings and those before Collier J. 37 Reliance upon Randhawa may provide a further instance. The ground now relied upon in this Court did not find its counterpart in any of the grounds relied upon before the Federal Magistrate and was not mentioned in the applicant's written submissions as filed with that Court. 38 Other parallels may also be discerned from a comparison between the grounds raised in the present proceedings and those before Collier J. 39 The orders of the Court are: 1. The appeal be dismissed. 2. The Appellant to pay the costs of the First Respondent of and incidental to the appeal.

Case1269,affirmed,SZNAL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 673,"appellant is a citizen of China who arrived in Australia on 3 April 2008. She lodged an application for protection visa, which was refused by a delegate of the Minister. On an application for review of that decision, the Refugee Review Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate. The Tribunal was not satisfied the applicant's conduct in Australia satisfied s 91R(3)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). On an application for review to the Federal Magistrates Court, Raphael FM dismissed the application ( SZNAL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 673). In her notice of appeal the appellant raises a single ground, which, as particularised, may raise certain sub-grounds. The ground in the notice of appeal is that the Federal Magistrate failed to consider the applicant's claim that the RRT decision was affected by jurisdictional error in that it incorrectly applied s 91R(3) of the Act. The particulars are: ""According to s 91R(3) , the Tribunal must disregard the applicant's conduct in Australia."" ('Ground 1') ""The Tribunal failed to invite the applicant to establish the purpose for her Falun Gong practice in Australia."" ('Ground 2') ""The applicant claims that she did not practise Falun Gong for the purpose of her current visa applicant."" ('Ground 3') Before the Tribunal the appellant claimed that she became a practitioner of Falun Gong in 1998 but that in 1999 she ceased practising Falun Gong when Falun Gong was banned. The appellant did not claim to have left China because she was a Falun Gong practitioner who was unable to practise Falun Gong. Rather, her claim seems to have been that she had a well-founded fear of persecution due to her imputed political opinion as a person who opposed the government's treatment of Falun Gong practitioners."

There, his Honour said that while the direction invited a balancing exercise which would normally involve an assessment of all the relevant factors having regard to their significance in the case in question, in fact that direction fettered that process. This was because it prescribed that some factors could never have more weight than others. His Honour pointed out that direction No 17 set out primary considerations which amounted to direct outcomes resultant from a person's bad character so that its effect was that ( Aksu 65 ALD at 674 [23]): ""... once he or she fails the character test, there is virtually a prescription in favour of refusal or revocation of a visa.

But as French, Sackville and Hely JJ observed in Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; (2003) 75 ALD 630 at 641 [47] ""the inference that the tribunal had failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure expressly to deal with that issue in its reasons."" However, they said that where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue at least has been identified at some point the inference will not be drawn too readily and continued: ""It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked."""

There Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: ""The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights (see Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at p 12, per Mason CJ)."" They said that application of this principle by the Courts would be likely to enhance the Parliamentary process by securing a greater measure of attention to the impact of legislative proposals on fundamental rights: Coco 179 CLR at 437-438. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Sciascia (1991) 31 FCR 364 at 370-372 Burchett and Lee JJ discussed (in passages approved in Haneef 163 FCR at 443 [108] and [111]) a statutory predecessor of s 501 that provided that an illegal immigrant was liable to deportation if that person had been convicted of offences and been sentenced to imprisonment for at least one year. They said that the section deprived the persons ""caught by it of one of their most precious rights, their right of community"". Burchett and Lee JJ said that the making of a deportation order was a plain infringement of liberty and was more so if the law authorising it was retroactive. They said ( Sciascia 31 FCR at 372): ""Both retrospectivity and curtailment of liberty, when found in any statute, are strong pointers towards a construction strictly confining its operation."""
Case1277,cited,Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338,"long line of authority in this Court has held that the tribunal has jurisdiction to review a purported decision, even where it is clear that the decision of the original decision-maker was affected by a jurisdictional error: Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338 at 342 344 per Bowen CJ, 370 per Smithers J; Zubair v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at 352-354 [28] - [32] per Finn, Mansfield and Gyles JJ. The tribunal has power to cure a defect in the delegate's decision once the tribunal's jurisdiction has been invoked by an application for review: Zubair 139 FCR at 354. A party affected will elect to treat an administrative decision as valid, though erroneous, by exercising the right to have it reviewed by a second administrative body, in preference to exercising a right to have a court compel proper performance by the original authority of its duty. Such an outcome promotes administrative efficiency, provided that the party applying for the review subsequently receives a fair hearing by the second body. In that way, any defects in the process by which the original decision was reached are cured by the later determination on the administrative review or administrative appeal: Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 at 116 per Mason J."
Case1278,applied,Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163,"is a jurisdictional error for an administrative tribunal to ignore relevant material: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The tribunal must give its reasons for its decision pursuant to s 43(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act . The reasons must include the tribunal's findings on material questions of fact together with a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based: s 43(2B). As McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 346 [68] , in respect of the analogous provision in s 430 of the Migration Act , the tribunal need not make findings on any and every matter of fact objectively material to its decision. They said that s 430: ""... requires no more than that the tribunal set out the findings which it did make. Neither expressly nor impliedly does this section require the tribunal to make , and then set out, some findings additional to those which it actually made."" (original emphasis) The assessment was considered by the tribunal in relation to Mr Toro Martinez's return to Columbia and the position of his fianc&eacute;e. But, the tribunal assessed his relationship with his daughter only on the basis of the 15 April 2008 letter. The tribunal did not expressly consider the assessment's conclusion that it would be unreasonable to expect the daughter to travel to Columbia, no doubt, because of its finding as to the nature of the relationship between her and her father. Since I have found that the tribunal ignored and thus, failed to have regard to the strongly corroborative and relevant material in the daughter's 2001 interview and 2007 letter, I am satisfied that it committed a jurisdictional error: Craig 184 CLR at 179. Ground 3 Mr Toro Martinez argued that the tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that it was reasonable for it to conclude that he would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia. The tribunal noted that he had claimed that he might face personal danger in ""certain regions"" but that he had not asserted that Cordoba was one of them. It said he had no knowledge of any particular problems, of the nature he feared, in the town in which his sole surviving uncle lived. The tribunal had relied upon the conclusion of the departmental officer who had compiled the international obligations and humanitarian concerns assessment that there was a mere possibility that Mr Toro Martinez might suffer serious harm as a result of indiscriminate generalised or random violence were he to return to Columbia. He complained that the tenor of the assessment was replete with references to instability, human rights abuses at every level of government and society in Columbia, and the insurgency of guerilla groups who also indulged in substantial and repeated violations of human rights. He claimed that country information also supported a very pessimistic assessment of the state of civil society in Columbia."

He contended that this retrospectively deemed the delegate's decision always to have been valid and that, as a result, the tribunal's decision affirming that decision was unimpeachable. The Minister argued that to affirm the decision under review had the effect of leaving the delegate's decision as the only operative decision. He contended that an affirmation by the tribunal of a decision of a delegate has the effect that the original decision of the delegate continues to operate and the later decision of the tribunal does not operate in substitution: Kim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 73 ; (2008) 167 FCR 578 at 583 [23] per Tamberlin J, with whom Besanko J agreed at 586 [42]; see also Daher v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 70 FCR 585 at 587F-588B per North J.

They said: ""It does not exercise afresh the power conferred by the enactment under which the decision was made. A fortiori, when it affirms a decision or sets it aside and remits it for reconsideration, it does not exercise a power conferred by the enactment under which the primary decision-maker has made his or her decision ... Analogous reasoning in Daher v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 70 FCR 585 at 587 led North J to conclude that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision of the Minister to refuse a visa was not itself a decision to refuse the grant of the visa."""
Case1280,applied,Enfield City v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135,"finding is the province of the tribunal. Ordinarily, an error of fact by the tribunal will not constitute a jurisdictional error, let alone an error of law. There is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact: Enfield City v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135 at 154 [44] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Mr Toro Martinez accepted that position. However, he argued that the tribunal's conclusion that he would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia was not a finding that the tribunal could make on any fair reading of the totality of the material on which it was based. He relied on the principle that if a decision-maker made a finding that was a critical step in arriving at its ultimate conclusion, but had no evidence to support it, the finding may well constitute a jurisdictional error: SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 at 407 [19] per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ; SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] per Greenwood J; SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at 12 [42] per Flick J."

Case1283,followed,Lesuma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2106 ; (2007) 99 ALD 514,"my opinion Direction No 21 does not have that vice. The Minister asserted that it created a rebuttable presumption about the weight to be given to primary considerations that should guide the exercise of decision-makers' discretions in a uniform manner. I agree with Emmett J who said that the terms of Direction No 21 do not contain a requirement that any decision-maker, whether the Minister, a delegate or the tribunal, reach a conclusion that particular conduct of the visa holder is abhorrent: Lesuma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2007] FCA 2106 ; (2007) 99 ALD 514 at 517 [11] . I am not satisfied that Direction No 21 exceeded the ambit of the Minister's power to give it under s 499(1). Often decision-makers will be required to take into account or to have regard to, or to give weight to, numerous, sometimes conflicting factors in arriving at decisions by force of legislation. Similarly, in general, the description of a factor as a ""primary consideration"" or the attribution of weight to be given to a factor will provide an effective guide to decision-makers but will not require them to arrive at a predetermined conclusion. Because par 2.2 requires an overall balancing process to be undertaken by the decision-maker, he or she will be able to address the necessities and circumstances of the individual case."

But he said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no importance.

Case1288,applied,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"am not satisfied that the tribunal committed any error in the way in which it expressed itself. Decision-makers are allowed considerable latitude in their choice of expression of the reasons they had for determining the matter as they did: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. I reject this ground. Ground 6 Mr Toro Martinez claimed that he had been denied procedural fairness because the tribunal referred to two documents in forming its conclusion that: 'Without more detailed evidence and submissions, one could not draw conclusions about the practical standard of health care that would be available to the applicant in [two named towns], but it seems safe to say that Columbia is not totally devoid of medical services."" The two documents were material from the Pan American Health Organisation as to Columbia's health system, the number of public hospitals, doctors and nurses and pages in Volume 2 of a publication ""Health in the Americas 2007"" which dealt with the State's subsidised health insurance system. It is common ground that those documents were not drawn to Mr Toro Martinez's attention before the tribunal made its decision and he had no opportunity to inspect them, or to make submissions in relation to them. Under s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , the tribunal was required to: ""... ensure that every party to a proceeding before the tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case and, in particular, to inspect any documents to which the tribunal proposes to have regard in reaching a decision in the proceeding and to make submissions in relation to those documents."""

Case1291,discussed,Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513,"Courts have developed guidelines or principles from time to time that are used in the exercise of discretions in judicial decision-making. As Mason and Deane JJ pointed out in Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 519 it does not follow that, because a discretion is expressed in legislation in general terms, the legislature intends that the Court should refrain from developing rules or guidelines affecting its exercise. They said that such rules can promote consistency in decision-making and diminish the risks of arbitrary and capricious adjudication. I am of opinion that similar considerations inform the giving and content of directions under powers such as s 499(1). It is a feature of parliamentary democracy that government policy should be carried out through the exercise of the executive power which, in turn, is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The structure of our system of government is that the executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General by s 61 of the Constitution . However, in practice and as a matter of convention that power is exercised by the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth who administer departments of State pursuant to s 64 of the Constitution . And, s 64 also requires that a Minister may not hold office for longer than three months unless he or she becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. Thus, the exercise of the executive power under Ch II of the Constitution is confided to Ministers who are answerable for their conduct of the executive power in the Parliament. One purpose of the Parliament enacting legislation with broad discretions, such as are found in s 501(2) of the Migration Act , is to accommodate changing government policies over the years. The constitutional scheme of responsible government would be defeated if departmental decision-makers were entirely free to arrive at their own idiosyncratic views, unfettered by the control of the Minister who, by s 64 of the Constitution , is the person who administers a department of State and answers for that administration in the Parliament. Hence, the power to give a written direction under s 499 is a valuable means of the Minister ensuring that officers of his or her department will have appropriate regard to the objectives or policies of the government of the day in the exercise of their powers and functions. I am of opinion that the power in s 501(2) to cancel a visa is capable of being made the subject of a direction made under s 499(1)."

Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked."""

(2) In subitem (1): transitional (permanent) visa means a transitional (permanent) visa referred to in the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations. transitional (temporary) visa means a transitional (temporary) visa referred to in the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations."" GROUNDS OF REVIEW Mr Toro Martinez argued that the decision of the tribunal involved a jurisdictional error and therefore was to be regarded as no decision at all ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) on the following bases: (1) The only correct or preferable decision at which it could have arrived was that the decision should be set aside because the visa had not been granted or taken to be granted for the purposes of s 501 having regard to the law later laid down in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. (2) The tribunal ignored relevant considerations by failing to have regard to: (a) the impact on Mr Toro Martinez's daughter as revealed in her interview with the Department in June 2001, and her letter to the Department in July 2007 because it referred only to a letter she had written on 15 April 2008 in concluding that she would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal; and (b) the conclusion of the Department's International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment that, because of the poor overall security situation in Columbia, it would be unreasonable to expect Mr Toro Martinez's fianc&eacute;e or his daughter to leave the relative safety of Australian society and accompany him to Columbia. (3) The tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that Mr Toro Martinez would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia because, first, the International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment had identified that other States were choosing not to return persons involuntarily to Columbia and, secondly, there were multiple human rights violations there. (4) Direction No 21 made by the Minister under s 499 of the Act was invalid because it went beyond the giving of directions or interfered with the unfettered discretion of a decision-maker under s 501(2). (5) The tribunal applied Direction No 21 by obeying its requirements to give prominence or weight to matters as primary considerations and thus failed to have regard to all of the relevant circumstances, according them appropriate weight as it saw fit. (6) The tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness because it did not give Mr Toro Martinez any opportunity, let alone a reasonable opportunity, to inspect documents to which it proposed to have regard in reaching its decision in contravention of s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) or alternatively its common law obligation to accord him procedural fairness. Ground 1 Mr Toro Martinez argued that item 7 expressly referred to two classes of decision, first, those by the Minster made under identified sections of the Act (item 7(1)(a)) and secondly, by a delegate of the Minister made under only s 501 (item 7(1)(b)). He pointed out that in the 2008 amendment there was no reference to decisions made by the tribunal. He argued that if the Minister wished now to cancel a visa that previously had not been cancelled validly, he could do so under the new s 501HA. But, the Minister wished to have the legislation construed so as to make valid a decision of the tribunal which, at the time it was given, was not a decision at all because of its jurisdictional error in affirming a decision that could not have been made under s 501 ( Plaintiff S157 211 CLR at 506 [76]). Mr Toro Martinez argued that for this result to ensue clear words of necessary intendment were required, and the Parliament had not used them. He argued that all item 7(1) did was to restore validity to the delegate's decision. But, he contended, this did not affect the legal status of the tribunal's invalid decision. He argued that regardless of whether the decision of the delegate was valid or invalid, in reviewing that decision the tribunal was exercising an independent function under s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ."

Case1296,followed,Re Brian Lawlor Automotive and Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167,"the contrasting position, that has actually occurred, the tribunal decided that the correct and preferable decision was the one arrived at by the delegate. It would be an odd result if item 7 operated to validate the latter decision but had no effect on the former. The natural and ordinary meaning of item 7 is that it validates certain decisions of the Minister and his delegates. If it cannot, and in its terms does not, undo other decisions, such as those of the tribunal, I am of opinion that item 7 should not be read to validate other decisions to which it is not expressly directed. However as Brennan J said in Re Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd and Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167 at 175-176 in a passage approved by Hayne and Heydon JJ in Shi 235 CLR 315 [100]. ""A decision by the Tribunal pursuant to s 43(1)(a) to affirm the original decision leaves the original decision intact, and this is the only decision which takes effect under the enactment: the original powers are not drawn upon by the Tribunal's order. Equally, a decision to set aside the decision under review and remit the matter for reconsideration pursuant to s 43(1)(c)(ii) requires the original repository of the powers and discretions to exercise them afresh: they are not exercised by the Tribunal. Section 43(1) grants the original powers and discretions to the Tribunal, but it does not require the Tribunal to exercise them unless the Tribunal is making a fresh order the effectiveness of which depends upon their exercise."""

Case1299,cited,Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 132 ; (2008) 171 FCR 56,"as a result of the subsequent decision of the Full Court of this Court in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 132 ; (2008) 171 FCR 56 , it is common ground that Mr Toro Martinez's visa was in a class of visa that was not then capable of cancellation under s 501(2). This was because the visa did not meet the description in s 501(2) of a visa ""... that has been granted to a person"". The Full Court held that the legislative scheme providing for the conversion of Mr Toro Martinez's permanent entry permit into a transitional (permanent) visa did not involve any grant of that visa to him. If a person was the holder of a permanent entry permit immediately before 1 September 1994 then reg (4)(1) of the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 1994 provided that ""... that entry permit continues in effect on and after 1 September 1994 as a transitional (permanent) visa that permits the holder to remain indefinitely in Australia"". The source of Mr Toro Martinez's visa was his permanent entry permit which was continued in effect as a visa by force of reg 4. Accordingly, it is common ground that the decision of the delegate of the Minister made on 10 March 2008 to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa under s 501(2) was invalid since the Minister had no power to cancel a visa that had not, in fact, been granted. The consequence of the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 was that the only correct and preferable decision which the tribunal could have made at the time it acted was to set aside the decision under review, because there was no power to make it in the first place. Mr Toro Martinez applied promptly to this Court to review the decision of the tribunal. Before any hearing of the application to the Court, the Minister accepted that the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 applied equally to Mr Toro Martinez, because the original decision to cancel his visa had no force or effect. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship wrote to Mr Toro Martinez and informed him of this outcome. The letter warned him that the legislative position may change. He was released from immigration detention. Consequently, on 26 August 2008 Mr Toro Martinez filed a notice of discontinuance of his application in the Court. Next, the Parliament enacted the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2008 which inserted s 501HA into the Act. The purpose of that provision was to reverse Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 as it applied to decisions taken after the day on which the amendment commenced, being 19 September 2008 (see Schedule 4, items 5 and 6(iii)). In item 7 of Schedule 4 of the 2008 amendment the Parliament provided that any decision to cancel a transitional permanent visa made or purporting to have been made by the Minister or a delegate before 19 September 2008 was deemed to be valid. Mr Toro Martinez was then returned to immigration detention and filed a fresh application challenging the tribunal's decision. On 5 December 2008 Emmett J dismissed that application as incompetent ( Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 1995) but his Honour granted leave to Mr Toro Martinez to withdraw his notice of discontinuance in these proceedings since the Minister did not oppose this course. His Honour also made directions in these proceedings: Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1994. What the 2008 amendment meant in the context of a person in Mr Toro Martinez's position is the principal ground of the present amended application. It is necessary to set out the relevant items of the Schedule in the 2008 amendment in order to understand the argument: "" 5 After section 501H Insert: 501HA Application of sections 501 to 501H to transitional (permanent) visas and transitional (temporary) visas If, under the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations, a person: (a) held a permanent return visa, permanent entry permit or permanent visa that continues in effect as a transitional (permanent) visa; or (b) held a temporary entry permit or temporary visa that continues in effect as a transitional (temporary) visa; or (c) is taken to hold a transitional (permanent) visa; the person is also taken, for the purposes of sections 501 to 501H, to have been granted a visa. 6 Application (1) The amendment made by item 2 of this Schedule applies in respect of a person who has been granted: (a) a bridging visa (within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 ); or (b) a criminal justice visa (within the meaning of that Act); on or after the day on which that item commences. (2) The amendment made by item 4 of this Schedule applies in relation to an authorised recipient, whether the notice under subsection 494D(1) of the Migration Act 1958 in relation to the authorised recipient is given before, on or after the day on which that item commences. (3) The amendment made by item 5 of this Schedule applies in respect of a decision to cancel a visa that is made under the Migration Act 1958 on or after the day on which that item commences. Validation of pre-commencement decisions in relation to transitional (permanent) visas and transitional (temporary) visas (1) To avoid doubt, any decision made or purported to have been made: (a) by the Minister under section 501, 501A, 501B, 501C or 501F of the Migration Act 1958 (as in force at any time on or after 1 September 1994 and before the day on which this item commences) before the day on which item 5 of this Schedule commences; or (b) by a delegate of the Minister under section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 (as in force at any time on or after 1 September 1994 and before the day on which this item commences) before the day on which item 5 of this Schedule commences; to cancel a transitional (permanent) visa or a transitional (temporary) visa is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been if the transitional (permanent) visa or transitional (temporary) visa were a visa that had been granted. (2) In subitem (1): transitional (permanent) visa means a transitional (permanent) visa referred to in the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations. transitional (temporary) visa means a transitional (temporary) visa referred to in the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations."" GROUNDS OF REVIEW Mr Toro Martinez argued that the decision of the tribunal involved a jurisdictional error and therefore was to be regarded as no decision at all ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) on the following bases: (1) The only correct or preferable decision at which it could have arrived was that the decision should be set aside because the visa had not been granted or taken to be granted for the purposes of s 501 having regard to the law later laid down in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. (2) The tribunal ignored relevant considerations by failing to have regard to: (a) the impact on Mr Toro Martinez's daughter as revealed in her interview with the Department in June 2001, and her letter to the Department in July 2007 because it referred only to a letter she had written on 15 April 2008 in concluding that she would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal; and (b) the conclusion of the Department's International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment that, because of the poor overall security situation in Columbia, it would be unreasonable to expect Mr Toro Martinez's fianc&eacute;e or his daughter to leave the relative safety of Australian society and accompany him to Columbia. (3) The tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that Mr Toro Martinez would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia because, first, the International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment had identified that other States were choosing not to return persons involuntarily to Columbia and, secondly, there were multiple human rights violations there. (4) Direction No 21 made by the Minister under s 499 of the Act was invalid because it went beyond the giving of directions or interfered with the unfettered discretion of a decision-maker under s 501(2). (5) The tribunal applied Direction No 21 by obeying its requirements to give prominence or weight to matters as primary considerations and thus failed to have regard to all of the relevant circumstances, according them appropriate weight as it saw fit. (6) The tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness because it did not give Mr Toro Martinez any opportunity, let alone a reasonable opportunity, to inspect documents to which it proposed to have regard in reaching its decision in contravention of s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) or alternatively its common law obligation to accord him procedural fairness. Ground 1 Do the words in item 7 ""... is taken always to have been as valid"" have a retrospective operation so as to deny that the tribunal made any jurisdictional error? Mr Toro Martinez filed his notice of discontinuance in this Court on 26 August 2008, more than three weeks before item 7 came into operation as a law of the Commonwealth. Thus, it could not be said that the enactment of item 7 affected these proceedings at the time as pending or current litigation. The evident intention of the 2008 amendment was to validate earlier decisions to cancel visas that had not been ""granted"" but were nonetheless operative. Those visas were in the category that the judgment in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 had revealed could not fall within the then statutory powers of cancellation. Item 7 in the 2008 amendment is capable of operating in a manner that infringes the liberty of persons whose visas had been purportedly cancelled under decisions of the Minister or a delegate that were invalid for reasons given in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. The item is intended to restore the legal force of those decisions. The Minister argued that because item 7 has the effect of validating the delegate's decision retrospectively, the necessary consequence is that the tribunal's decision is also validated. That followed, he contended, because the tribunal's affirmation of the delegate's decision never operated (unlike the case prior to the 2008 amendment) on a valid decision of the delegate to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa even though it was not a visa that had been granted. In effect, the Minister argued that the words in item 7 ""... is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been"" not only validated the delegate's decision that had previously been invalid, but changed the status in law of the tribunal's decision. Here, the decision of the tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error at the time it was made on 19 June 2008. In my opinion the decision of the tribunal was no decision at all. The Tribunal had not made a decision in accordance with s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , because the only correct and preferable decision to which it could have arrived on 19 June 2008 was to set aside the decision to cancel the visa as not having been a decision made in accordance with s 501. The visa had never been grated to Mr Toro Martinez and was therefore outside the reach of s 501(2): Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. The 2008 amendment did not deal in item 7 with a purported decision of the tribunal. The language of item 7 addressed two of the three possible categories of decision to which Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 applied, namely a decision by, first, the minister under identified sections of the Act and, secondly, the delegate under s 501 alone. That raises the question whether the words ""... is as valid, as it would have been if the transitional (permenant) visa ... were a visa that had been granted"" operate to change the nature of the tribunal's decision because they transformed the earlier invalid decision of the delegate into a valid decision. Although there is no evidence as to the number of potentially affected decisions, it is safe to infer that a considerable number of visas in the affected category had been cancelled over the previous years. Challenges to the cancellation of those visas, like Mr Toro Martinez's, would have been made to, first, the tribunal and then to this Court and the High Court. The consequence of giving item 7 a narrow construction is that persons who left Australia either voluntarily or involuntarily, based on failed challenges to the purported cancellation of their visas could now assert rights of re-entry and residence on the ground that the tribunal's decisions to affirm the cancellations were affected by the above jurisdictional error. It is unlikely that the Parliament intended that consequence. That may be why it chose the opening words of the chapeau to item 7(1): ""To avoid doubt, any decision made or purported to have been made."" The doubt referred to was, clearly enough, whether those two classes of decision were valid. The language of the Parliament does not suggest that it sought to create a distinction between those who had accepted a decision by the Minister or a delegate to cancel their visas without challenge and those who had applied unsuccessfully to the tribunal or the Courts to set aside the decision to cancel. Such a distinction would create, not avoid, doubt. The anomalous result would ensure that a person who had taken proceedings to reverse the cancellation but failed would be in a better position than someone who had accepted the decision in the first place. It would certainly give a new and unattractive twist to the aphorism that ""it is better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all"". If the tribunal had arrived at the conclusion, subsequently established by the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , that it had no power to cancel the visa under s 501, it would have set aside the decision of the delegate (see: s 43 (1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ). Had the tribunal done that, item 7 would not have had any effect on the tribunal's decision because the delegate's decision would no longer be operative. As Hayne and Heydon JJ identified in Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 ; (2008) 235 CLR 286 at 314 315 [96]-[98], the tribunal's task here was to decide on the material before it whether to exercise the Minister's power under s 501(2) (if it existed). That being so, although the Minister's delegate's decision has been validated by item 7, the tribunal is yet to perform its function of review of that decision in accordance with law. By applying to the tribunal before the 2008 amendment came into force, a person who then invoked a challenge to the Minister's or delegate's decision under s 501(2) elected to treat that decision as valid, though erroneous, and to have the tribunal exercise the power, in preference to challenging the decision in judicial review proceedings: Twist 136 CLR at 116 per Mason J. And the tribunal could have ""cured"" the defect in the delegate's decision by setting it aside: cf Zubair 139 FCR at 354. But the decision of the tribunal in respect of Mr Toro Martinez was given in respect of a different legal and factual scenario from that considered by the delegate and, because of Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , was no decision at all, being infected by jurisdictional error."

Case1302,distinguished,Shepherd v Felt &amp; Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359,"Minister also sought to draw an analogy with stamp duty legislation that prohibited the admission into evidence of an unstamped instrument but gave the instrument, once duly stamped, its full force and effect, relying on Shepherd v Felt &amp; Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359 at 383 per Dixon J. I reject this argument. First, stamp duty legislation, ordinarily, does not affect liberty of individuals or fundamental human rights. Secondly, that legislation suspends, conditionally, the operation of an existing instrument only when it is sought to be put into evidence. I do not consider that generalised references to stamp duty legislation assist in construing item 7. The Parliament enacted the 2008 amendments knowing that both the tribunal and the Courts would have made decisions affecting visas purportedly cancelled by one of the two classes of decision for which item 7 provided. Yet, the 2008 amendments did not address curing any error made by the tribunal in arriving at its decision. Nor did the 2008 amendments validate any decision of the tribunal. The liberty of an individual is at stake. The Parliament did not express, in unambiguous and clear language, its intention to remove the accrued right of persons in the position of Mr Toro Martinez to treat the decision of the tribunal as no decision at all. I am of opinion that the tribunal's decision should be quashed and a writ of mandamus issued to command it to perform its function of review according to law. Ground 2 The essence of the second ground is that the tribunal failed to have regard to or consider the evidence of Mr Toro Martinez's daughter and a departmental assessment relating to conditions in Columbia concerning the effect on her, were the visa to be cancelled. The tribunal did not make any reference in its reasons to an interview given by the daughter to the Department in June 2001 or to her letter of July 2007. The only evidence of the daughter to which the tribunal referred was her letter of 15 April 2008. The tribunal used the latter letter and her failure to refer to significant matters in it (which the daughter however had said in the 2001 interview and 2007 letter) in arriving at two important findings. Nor did the tribunal refer in its decision to the international obligations and humanitarian concerns assessment that it would be unreasonable to expect the daughter to depart the relative safety of Australian society and accompany her father to Columbia."
Case1303,applied,Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 ; (2008) 235 CLR 286,"the tribunal had arrived at the conclusion, subsequently established by the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , that it had no power to cancel the visa under s 501, it would have set aside the decision of the delegate (see: s 43 (1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ).

It would be an odd result if item 7 operated to validate the latter decision but had no effect on the former. The natural and ordinary meaning of item 7 is that it validates certain decisions of the Minister and his delegates. If it cannot, and in its terms does not, undo other decisions, such as those of the tribunal, I am of opinion that item 7 should not be read to validate other decisions to which it is not expressly directed. However as Brennan J said in Re Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd and Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167 at 175-176 in a passage approved by Hayne and Heydon JJ in Shi 235 CLR 315 [100]. ""A decision by the Tribunal pursuant to s 43(1)(a) to affirm the original decision leaves the original decision intact, and this is the only decision which takes effect under the enactment: the original powers are not drawn upon by the Tribunal's order. Equally, a decision to set aside the decision under review and remit the matter for reconsideration pursuant to s 43(1)(c)(ii) requires the original repository of the powers and discretions to exercise them afresh: they are not exercised by the Tribunal. Section 43(1) grants the original powers and discretions to the Tribunal, but it does not require the Tribunal to exercise them unless the Tribunal is making a fresh order the effectiveness of which depends upon their exercise."" Even though the delegate's original decision to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa was left intact, the tribunal decided that this was the correct and preferable decision on the material before it. That is, the function which the tribunal performed was a review on the merits of the delegate's decision using all of the material available up to the time that the tribunal made its decision: Shi 235 CLR at 298-299 [34]-[38] per Kirby J, 314-316 [96]-[101] per Hayne and Heydon JJ, 324-325 [134], 326 [137], 327-328 [140]-[144] per Kiefel J, with whom Crennan J agreed on this issue at 319 [117]. As Kiefel J observed, s 43(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act gives the tribunal powers in s 43(1)(a) to (c) for the purpose of reviewing a decision. She said that the purpose of the powers was ""... to permit the Tribunal to consider for itself what the decision should be"": Shi 235 CLR at 326 [137]. It is in that task that the tribunal committed a jurisdictional error and thus failed to complete its review in accordance with law."

Case1309,followed,Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758,"Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, Mason J explained that in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it was generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters that are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. But he said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no importance. Mason J cautioned that the preferred ground on which that judicial power was to be exercised was that the decision was ""manifestly unreasonable"". I discussed the principles applicable to a statutory duty of, or requirement for, a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to factors in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] . When the expression ""regard must be had to"" or like expressions are used in a statute in respect of a particular criterion or factor to be considered by a decision-maker, he or she is bound to treat such a factor as a central or fundamental element in the making of the relevant decision: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2009] FCAFC 23 at [267] per Jacobson, Lander and Foster JJ applying Telstra [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] . Often the three primary considerations in Direction No 21 will tend in different directions. The best interests of a visa holder's child may often be to remain with his or her parent, while the protection of the Australian community or its expectations may tend in the other direction. As I said in Telstra [2008] FCA 1758 at [110] , in the context of ordinary principles of administrative decision-making, where fundamental weight must be given to a particular factor or factors, the requirement is that the decision-maker treat consideration of the factors, as opposed to the factors themselves, is a central element in the deliberative process. It will be in this manner that he or she will give appropriate weight to those factors. I am of opinion that par 2.17 permits the decision-maker to accommodate such an interpretation. It refers to other 11 factors that, where relevant, it may be appropriate for the decision-maker to take into account, but as par 2.17 continued, it was the government's view that: ""... generally they be given less individual weight than that given to the primary considerations."" In my opinion the requirements of Direction No 21 do not dictate any particular outcome. Rather, they reflect factors which must be considered by a decision-maker together with others which may be considered. Merely because two of the factors require that the protection of the Australian community and its expectations are to be given weight as primary considerations, does not mean that they necessarily and in every case will outweigh one or more other considerations, even if they are not primary considerations. However, by identifying some primary considerations and requiring the decision-maker to give weight to them, the direction emphasises that the decision-maker must have regard to those matters as a fundamental part of his or her deliberation. That does not preclude the decision-maker determining that some other factor is more important in particular circumstances. Ground 5 Mr Toro Martinez argued that the tribunal committed a jurisdictional error in applying Direction No 21 in the manner in which it did. He contended that this was because at the conclusion of its reasoning it stated that par 2.17 stipulated that other considerations were to receive less individual weight than the primary ones and that notwithstanding the well prepared and well argued case for Mr Toro Martinez, after considering all the evidence, the tribunal said: ""I must conclude that the primary considerations of community protection and expectations outweigh the other considerations in this case."" Earlier in its reasoning it had noted that par 2.6(a) of the direction gave ""special and unique prominence and emphasis to offences involving the ... importation ... of illicit drugs"". Mr Toro Martinez had been convicted of two offences committed in November 1996. He had pleaded guilty to the first, under s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) of being knowingly concerned in the importation of 655 grams of pure cocaine, which exceeded the trafficable quantity. The maximum penalty for that offence was 25 years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000. Following a Crown appeal, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a three year non-parole period. He was also convicted in February 2002 of a second offence after a jury trial in respect of being the principal behind an importation of 4.492 kilograms of cocaine into Australia in December 1996. He was sentenced to 12 years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period that expired on 8 June 2008. In that context, the tribunal was entitled to have regard to the very serious conduct involved in Mr Toro Martinez's offending. The tribunal gave detailed consideration to Mr Toro Martinez's present situation. It concluded that although the evidence of his rehabilitation suggested that the risk of recidivism might be low, it was nevertheless real and, if it occurred, could have serious consequences for the community. The tribunal had regard to these factors and the expectations of the Australian community. It concluded that the seriousness of the offences and their planned and calculated nature would ultimately lead most community members to the conclusion that the appropriate course was to cancel the visa. The tribunal then turned to considering other matters in accordance with par 2.17 of Direction No 21. It found that, as I have discussed above, the daughter would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal. It also found that there was a genuine relationship between Mr Toro Martinez and his fianc&eacute;e and that she would suffer hardship both emotionally and in terms of her business, were he to have his visa cancelled. The tribunal was evidently sympathetic towards the fianc&eacute;e. It found her to be an honest and deserving woman, making the observation that ""any decision-maker would wish to avoid occasioning her any hardship, but she knew the facts and must have realised there were risks involved in continuing with the relationship""."

Case1311,followed,Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106,"long line of authority in this Court has held that the tribunal has jurisdiction to review a purported decision, even where it is clear that the decision of the original decision-maker was affected by a jurisdictional error: Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338 at 342 344 per Bowen CJ, 370 per Smithers J; Zubair v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at 352-354 [28] - [32] per Finn, Mansfield and Gyles JJ. The tribunal has power to cure a defect in the delegate's decision once the tribunal's jurisdiction has been invoked by an application for review: Zubair 139 FCR at 354. A party affected will elect to treat an administrative decision as valid, though erroneous, by exercising the right to have it reviewed by a second administrative body, in preference to exercising a right to have a court compel proper performance by the original authority of its duty. Such an outcome promotes administrative efficiency, provided that the party applying for the review subsequently receives a fair hearing by the second body. In that way, any defects in the process by which the original decision was reached are cured by the later determination on the administrative review or administrative appeal: Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 at 116 per Mason J. That being so, although the Minister's delegate's decision has been validated by item 7, the tribunal is yet to perform its function of review of that decision in accordance with law. By applying to the tribunal before the 2008 amendment came into force, a person who then invoked a challenge to the Minister's or delegate's decision under s 501(2) elected to treat that decision as valid, though erroneous, and to have the tribunal exercise the power, in preference to challenging the decision in judicial review proceedings: Twist 136 CLR at 116 per Mason J. And the tribunal could have ""cured"" the defect in the delegate's decision by setting it aside: cf Zubair 139 FCR at 354. But the decision of the tribunal in respect of Mr Toro Martinez was given in respect of a different legal and factual scenario from that considered by the delegate and, because of Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , was no decision at all, being infected by jurisdictional error."

They said that the tribunal only obtained power to make a determination under the Act where its decision was based on findings or inferences of the facts grounded on probative material and logical grounds. It followed that a decision based on illogical or irrational findings or inferences of fact is a decision not supported by reason and is therefore invalid.

Case1320,cited,Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337,"The principles relevant to disqualification by reason of apprehended bias are set out in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 344-345: Where, in the absence of any suggestion of actual bias, a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of a judge ..., a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done, a requirement which reflects the fundamental importance of the principle that the tribunal be independent and impartial. It is convenient to refer to it as the apprehension of bias principle. The apprehension of bias principle may be thought to find its justification in the importance of the basic principle, that the tribunal be independent and impartial. So important is the principle that even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined. There are, however, some other aspects of the apprehension of bias principle which should be recognised. Deciding whether a judicial officer (or juror) might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of a question that has not been determined requires no prediction about how the judge or juror will in fact approach the matter. The question is one of possibility (real and not remote), not probability. Similarly, if the matter has already been decided, the test is one which requires no conclusion about what factors actually influenced the outcome. No attempt need be made to inquire into the actual thought processes of the judge or juror. The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. [footnotes omitted]"

Case1335,followed,Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344,"Several principles must be considered by the Court in determining an application for leave to extend time in which to institute proceedings. In Phillips McInnis FM referred to Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 in which Wilcox J (at 348-9) set out the principles to be adopted in relation to an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act'). McInnis FM determined that those principles were applicable to the exercise of discretion under s 46PO of the HREOC Act. Accordingly his Honour (at [10]) set out the following principles: '1. There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so. The ""prescribed period"" of 28 days is not to be ignored ( Ralkon v Aboriginal Development Commission (1982) 43 ALR 535 at 550). 2. It is a prima facie rule that the proceedings commenced outside the prescribed period will not be entertained ( Lucic v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411 at 416). It is not a pre-condition for success in an application for extension of time that an acceptable explanation for delay must be given. It is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given as a relevant matter to be considered, even though there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential pre-condition ( Comcare v A'Hearn (1993) 45 FCR 441 and Dix v Client Compensation Tribunal (1993) 1 VR 297 at 302). 3. Action taken by the applicant other than by making an application to the court is relevant in assessing the adequacy of the explanation for the delay. It is relevant to consider whether the applicant has rested on his rights and whether the respondent was entitled to regard the claim as being finalised. (See Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283 at 287) 4. Any prejudice to the respondent, including any prejudice in defending the proceeding occasioned by the delay, is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension. (See Doyle at p 287) 5. The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension. (See Lucic at p 416) 6. The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted. (See Lucic at p 417) 7. Considerations of fairness as between the applicant and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of the court's discretion ( Wedesweiller v Cole (1983) 47 ALR 528).' 12 The above principles are drawn almost verbatim from those formulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments. I consider that they are relevant to an application under s 46PO of the HREOC Act. The principles relevant to this appeal are numbers 4 and 6. 13 The appellant contends that Driver FM erred in his interpretation of prejudice for the purposes of an application to extend time in which to bring proceedings. The appellant also contends that Driver FM erred in assessing the merits of the appellant's case, because his Honour misconceived the basis of the vicarious liability of the respondent."
Case1336,considered,Lovett v Le Gall (1975) 10 SASR 479,"In Lovett v Le Gall (1975) 10 SASR 479 Bray CJ said (at 485): 'If the defendant has suffered no prejudice, as when he was well aware within the limitation period of the plaintiff's claim, or where the excess period of time is small, or where he cannot show that he has lost anything by reason of the delay, it may well be that the court will not find it difficult to come to the conclusion that it is fair and equitable in the circumstances to grant the extension.' All of the examples referred to by Bray CJ are examples of prejudice caused specifically by the delay in instituting proceedings."
Case1337,cited,Pham v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 669,"In refusing the leave application Driver FM considered the principles in Phillips v Aust Girls' Choir &amp; Anor [2001] FMCA 109 (' Phillips '), which were approved by this Court in Pham v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 669. There is no dispute between the parties concerning the applicability of those principles; rather the dispute relates to the application by Driver FM of those principles. The paragraphs of his Honour's reasons which relate to the issues in the current appeal are as follows: 'The issues arising in the matter date from around 1998, although they extended through to 2004. Mr Gurran, for the respondent, put to me that the allegations made to HREOC came as a surprise to the respondent and the respondent rather thought that the issues might have been resolved at the termination of the complaint. A fourth relevant consideration is any prejudice in defending the proceedings occasioned by the delay. This is a material factor against the grant of an extension, see Doyle at page 287. I regard the issue of prejudice in this case as a significant factor. The complaint to HREOC was against the employer only even though it was a complaint of sexual harassment by reason of the applicant's sexual preference. No complaint having been made against the alleged harassers, no proceeding can now be brought in this court against those persons. The jurisdiction of the court is limited to considering the claim against the harasser's employer and would be based on asserted vicarious liability. For its part, the respondent asserted before HREOC that the allegations of harassment came as a surprise. ... The events complained of go back up to seven years. The respondent asserts that the individuals allegedly responsible for the harassment are no longer employed by the respondent and one relevant witness is no longer in Australia. There would be real difficulty facing the respondent in dealing with the allegations in this Court. ... The sixth consideration is that the merits of the substantive application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted. The material put before HREOC and before the court to this point is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment against the persons allegedly responsible for that harassment. That is not the same thing as establishing a prima facie case against the single respondent, the employer, which would depend upon proof of vicarious liability. At this stage and particularly if the only evidence available is that of the applicant I would have to say that the prospects of success of the application against the respondent are uncertain. ... ... He [the applicant] could have brought that complaint forward rather earlier than he did. He certainly could and in my view should have pursued his rights in this court more promptly than he did. Having regard to the length of the delay in this matter which in my view is significant, the explanation for the delay which in my view is only partially convincing, the prejudice to the respondent if the proceeding continues, which in my view is real and substantial, and the interests of the administration of justice, I have come to the view that the application for an extension of time should be refused and I will so order.'"

Gummow J also observed in Thompson at 22: 'At common law, the liability of joint tortfeasors was said to be joint and several. The plaintiff might sue any one of the tortfeasors separately for the full amount of the loss, or all of them jointly in the same action.'

Case1340,considered,The Koursk [1924] P 140,"This legislative scheme is consistent with common law principles of vicarious liability of employers for tortious conduct of employees. In The Koursk [1924] P 140 Scrutton LJ said at 155: 'The substantial question in the present case is: What is meant by ""joint tortfeasors""? and one way of answering it is: ""Is the cause of action against them the same?"" Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be ""joint tortfeasors"": The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employment for his principal, and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two persons who agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort. These seem clearly joint tortfeasors; there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with, another.'"

Case1343,cited,Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450,"Traxon Industries Pty Ltd (Traxon) applied to the Court by motion dated 18 April 2006 for leave to serve proceedings on Emerson Electric Co (Emerson) in the United States of America (USA). The proceedings arose out of a dispute between Traxon and Emerson connected with the performance of a Confidentiality Agreement and a Distributorship Agreement relating to the marketing and sale, in the USA, of oil level control devices manufactured by Traxon. Traxon's causes of action against Emerson were for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), breach of contract, breach of duty of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. For reasons published on 26 April 2006 the motion was adjourned and Traxon given leave to amend its statement of claim and to file further affidavit evidence in support of its application Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450. The principal reason for the decision not to accede to Traxon's motion was its inclusion in the application and statement of claim of the causes of action arising out of breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. These causes of action were based entirely on conduct allegedly committed by Emerson in the United States. They did not otherwise fall within any of the categories of causes of action to which the relevant rule of Court, O 8, authorising service out of the jurisdiction, applies. 2 Traxon has now filed a proposed amended application and proposed amended statement of claim together with a proposed further amended application and further amended statement of claim. It has also filed additional affidavit material. In its proposed amended application and amended statement of claim Traxon seeks to join Traxon International Ltd (Traxon International) as a second applicant. It abandons the claim for breach of duty of confidence but maintains the claim based on breach of fiduciary duty. As an alternative position, it relies upon a further amended application and further amended statement of claim which would also omit the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty. 3 For the reasons which I now publish, I am prepared to grant leave to serve an application and statement of claim on Emerson in the United States in the form set out in the further amended application and further amended statement of claim. So that Emerson may also be served with a reasonably self contained set of reasons for that decision these reasons repeat elements of those published on 26 April 2006 adapted to take account of the amendments to the pleadings and the additional evidence which has been filed. 4 Traxon, on 18 April 2006, commenced proceedings in this Court against Emerson. It claimed damages for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act , at common law for breach of contract and, alternatively, in equity for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. Traxon is an Australian company which carries on the business of manufacturing, marketing and selling oil level control devices, one of which is known as the TraxOil Management System (the TraxOil Device). Emerson is incorporated in Missouri and currently trades under the business name Emerson Climate Technologies. It used to trade as Alco Controls. 5 By a notice of motion filed on 18 April 2006, Traxon sought leave to serve its application, statement of claim and supporting affidavits on Emerson in the USA. Its motion was filed pursuant to O 8 of the Federal Court Rules ."
Case1344,cited,Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers [2000] FCA 821,"The cause of action in breach of fiduciary duty is based on conduct engaged in in the United States. Even though the duty pleaded depends upon conduct in Australia that does not mean that its breach by acts outside Australia give rise to a cause of action 'arising in the Commonwealth' under O 8 r 1(a). As von Doussa J observed in Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers [2000] FCA 821 , the authorities establish that 'cause of action' within the meaning of O 8 r 1(a) does not refer to all the elements of the cause of action. It refers rather to the act on the part of the defendant which gave the plaintiff his cause for complaint. In Distillers Co (Biochemicals) v Thompson [1971] AC 458 at 467, Lord Pearson said (at 468): It is not the right approach to say that, because there was no complete tort until the damage occurred, therefore the cause of action arose wherever the damage happened to occur. The right approach is, when the tort is complete, to look back over the series of events constituting it and ask the question, where in substance did this cause of action arise? Theory no (iii) is that the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction if the act on the part of the defendant, which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint has occurred within the jurisdiction. That is the rule laid down in Jackson v Spittal (1870) LR 5CP 542, which is an authoritative case, and the rule is inherently reasonable, as the defendant is called upon to answer for his wrong in the courts of the country where he did the wrong.' Counsel for the applicants contends that the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty falls within O 8 r 1(ab)(ii). That is to say the proceeding, in so far as it seeks relief for breach of fiduciary duty is one which 'otherwise affects a contract'. In my respectful opinion that contention is unsustainable. While it may rightly be said that the fiduciary obligation, as pleaded, arises out of the asserted contractual relationship, the proceeding based upon breach of fiduciary duty does not of itself affect the contract. In my opinion, therefore, the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is not one to which O 8 r 1 applies. 77 As I concluded in the reasons published on 26 April 2006, the fact that the causes of action in misleading or deceptive conduct and breach of contract are within O 8 r 1, would be insufficient to satisfy the requirement that the rule 'applies to the proceeding' within the meaning of O 8 r 2(2)(b) for so long as the claim for breach of fiduciary duty is included. As von Doussa J said in Delco Australia [at 35]: 'In this Court r 1(n) makes express provision for a proceeding where a proceeding does not fall squarely within one of the heads enumerated in the earlier paragraphs. In my opinion r 1(n) makes it clear that an originating process to be served out of the Commonwealth must be confined to causes of action that fall wholly within one or several of the heads in r 1. An originating process that includes a claim that does not fall within one or more of the heads is not an originating process that meets the description of r 1, in that it is not one ""in"" any of the cases described in the rule. It is not a ""proceeding to which rule 1 applies"" so as to meet the requirement of r 2(2)(c)(b). A similar conclusion was expressed by Wilcox J in Tycoon Holdings Ltd v Tencor Jetco Inc (1992) 34 FCR 31 at 35.' 78 In the circumstances, because of the inclusion of the claim for breach of fiduciary duty, it is not possible to conclude that 'the proceeding' reflected in the amended application and the amended statement of claim is one to which O 8 r 1 applies. However the minute of further amended statement of claim which is proposed would omit the claim for breach of fiduciary duty and, on that basis, would transform the action into a proceeding to which O 8 r 1 applies. I am therefore prepared to make an order for service on Emerson in the United States of America of an application and statement of claim in terms of the further amended application and further amended statement of claim filed on 24 May 2006. A minute of proposed orders has been filed also to take account of that contingency. I will make orders in terms of the minute.

Case1346,cited,Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 161 CLR 399,"In this case, it is not possible for the Court to make orders concerning a hypothetical question which was not the subject of a claim by the applicant, nor decision by the first respondent, nor contention before the Tribunal, nor decision by the Tribunal that is, whether the losses of the applicant could in fact be carried forward on capital account. It is not the role of the Federal Court to answer hypothetical questions or give advisory opinions: Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 161 CLR 399 at 413-415. 74 Accordingly, in view of my findings concerning question a, it is both unnecessary for me to make any findings with respect to questions e and f, and inappropriate to make the orders sought by the applicant which could follow from any consideration of those questions. 75 In the grounds of appeal the applicant submits that no reasonable Tribunal, properly apprised of its role, could have made the findings that were made. It follows from my findings in this judgment that this claim cannot be substantiated. 76 Accordingly the answer to question g raised on appeal is ""Yes"". 77 In the grounds of appeal the applicant submits that: &#8226; the Tribunal's apparent error of fact that the controller of the applicant had been prosecuted for claiming the deductions leads a reasonable observer to the conclusion that the Tribunal did not give due consideration to the material before it, and may have been biased against the applicant; and &#8226; a Tribunal acting under such a misapprehension could more readily make adverse findings of fact against the applicant."

Case1348,cited,Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1349,cited,California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient."
Case1350,cited,Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997),"However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997). Relevance of purpose"
Case1351,considered,Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based. (see also, Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131 at 144 5, Deniz v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1983) 51 ALR 645 at 650, Repatriation Commission v Thompson 82 ALR at 358, Swift at 5,113, McAuliffe v Comcare [2002] FCA 769 at [51] , Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414 at [32] ) 63 In relation to question e, the applicant has not contended that there was no material upon which the decision of the Tribunal could properly be based only that there was a preponderance of evidence against the Tribunal's findings. As the Court pointed out in Collins , a finding of fact against the weight of evidence does not give rise to a question of law."
Case1352,cited,Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938,"Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342). Nature of purpose"
Case1353,cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400."
Case1354,applied,Commissioner of Taxation v The Myer Emporium Ltd [1987] HCA 18 ; (1987) 163 CLR 199,"Although s 26(a) ITAA 1936 specifically deemed, as income, profit arising from the sale by the taxpayer of any property acquired for the purpose of profit-making by sale, or from the carrying on or carrying out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme, it is clear that the acquisition of a property for profit-making by sale of that property can, of itself, give rise to assessable income within the ordinary usage of the word ( Commissioner of Taxation v The Myer Emporium Ltd [1987] HCA 18 ; (1987) 163 CLR 199; and note the useful discussion of the history of this principle by Davies J in McCurry v Commissioner of Taxation , unreported Federal Court of Australia, 15 May 1998). 23 The characterisation of activity as either capital or income was subject to some review by the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199, where the Court in a unanimous judgment held that it was perfectly possible for an isolated business operation or commercial transaction, entered into otherwise than in the ordinary course of the carrying on of the taxpayer's business, to nonetheless constitute income in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the word, provided that the taxpayer entered into the transaction with the intention or purpose of making a relevant profit or gain from the transaction (at 209-210, 211, 220). 24 Although the Court considered the well-known proposition that mere realisation of a capital asset does not produce a gain which is assessable income, as the Court said at 213: The proposition ... requires some elaboration. First, the emphasis is on the adjective ""mere""... Secondly, profits made on a realization or change of investments may constitute income if the investments were initially acquired as part of a business with the intention or purpose that they be realized subsequently in order to capture the profit arising from their expected increase in value... It is one thing if the decision to sell an asset is taken after its acquisition, there having been no intention or purpose at the time of acquisition of acquiring for the purpose of profit-making by sale. Then, if the asset be not a revenue asset on other grounds, the profit made is capital because it proceeds from a mere realization. But it is quite another thing if the decision to sell is taken by way of implementation of an intention or purpose, existing at the time of acquisition, of profit-making by sale, at least in the context of carrying on a business or carrying out a business operation or commercial transaction. 25 Their Honours said later in the judgment: The periodicity, regularity and recurrence of a receipt has been considered to be a hallmark of its character as income in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind... For present purposes it is sufficient for us to say...that, valuable though these considerations may be in categorizing receipts as income or capital in conventional situations, their significance is diminished when the receipt in question is generated in the course of carrying on a business, especially if it should transpire that the receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme. (at 215) 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342). Nature of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient."
Case1355,cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based. (see also, Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131 at 144 5, Deniz v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1983) 51 ALR 645 at 650, Repatriation Commission v Thompson 82 ALR at 358, Swift at 5,113, McAuliffe v Comcare [2002] FCA 769 at [51] , Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414 at [32] )"
Case1356,cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 22 However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997).

QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400."
Case1358,cited,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale .

In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32).

Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342). Nature of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 35 I also note comments of the Full Court in Cooling 22 FCR 42 and Selleck [1997] 799 FCA, referred to earlier in this judgment, that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities."
Case1359,cited,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041,"Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041, Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] ."

Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1361,applied,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 22 However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997). Relevance of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 30 In identifying the purpose of a corporate taxpayer, it is important indeed decisive to consider the purpose of those who control the taxpayer: Ruhamah 41 CLR at 160, 162, 166; Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 370. So, for example, in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 where ownership and control of the taxpayer company changed from that of individuals whose purpose in forming the taxpayer was for the taxpayer to hold land for the domestic purposes of those shareholders, to that of three companies which acquired the taxpayer for the purpose of carrying out a business operation of land development, a key issue in the decision was the fact of that change of control and the intentions of the new shareholders of the taxpayer. 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient."
Case1362,cited,Deniz v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1983) 51 ALR 645,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

As Jacobs J explained in McCormack 143 CLR at 314, there is, by virtue of the section, a rebuttable presumption of law that an assessment is not excessive, and the onus is on the taxpayer to rebut that presumption. This means, for example, that where the evidence is equivocal the applicant in an appeal before the Tribunal against an assessment fails to discharge its onus : Mason J in Gauci v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 54 ; (1975) 135 CLR 81 at 89-90, approved in McCormack 143 CLR by Gibbs J at 303-304, Stephen J at 306, Jacobs J at 314 and Murphy J at 323.

Case1365,cited,GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124,"In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient."
Case1366,cited,Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR,"However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997).

As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342).

QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400."
Case1369,discussed,Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale .

The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price.

The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32).

Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 48 In its Notice of Appeal, the applicant linked this question of law with paras 27-30 and para 35 of the Reasons for Decision of the Tribunal. In these paragraphs, in the context of considering whether the loss the applicant sought to carry forward was more appropriately characterised as a capital or income loss, Senior Member McCabe said as follows: 27. Section 14ZZK(b) says the taxpayer has the burden of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently. The Commissioner's decision effectively creates a presumption the applicant must rebut if he or she is to succeed in an appeal: see, for example, McCormack v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 at 314-315 per Jacobs J. That may be a difficult task where the taxpayer does not call any witnesses to explain a paper trail that does not speak for itself, or which is consistent with the Commissioner's view or even ambiguous. 28. The Commissioner has asked me to draw adverse inferences against the taxpayer in light of the fact the applicant has not called Mr D to give evidence. Mr D was in the best position to explain the transactions into which the applicant entered. His evidence would probably have been of assistance to the Tribunal. Mr Hack, for the Commissioner, says the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 should apply. That rule permits me to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call the witness in appropriate circumstances. One of the circumstances in which I may not draw an adverse inference is where there is a reasonable excuse for the failure to call the witness. I think there is a reasonable excuse in this case. That excuse can be gleaned from the submissions made in relation to the application for a suppression order: see A Taxpayer and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 398. Mr D has apparently declined to answer questions on the basis he might expose himself to a criminal prosecution. There is little point in calling a witness in those circumstances. 29. While I decline to draw an adverse inference from Mr D's failure to appear, that failure inevitably makes it harder for the applicant to show the Commissioner's decision was wrong. 30. The starting point of the analysis is the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v NF Williams (1972) 72 ATC 4188 per Gibb J at 4195. If the asset was more like trading stock that was bought and sold (or bought, developed, sub-divided and sold) as part of a business of developing and dealing in land, the law might treat the proceeds of the sale as income : see, for example, Whitfords Beach Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1982) 82 ATC 4031. ... 35. I have already observed the applicant would have difficulty establishing the Commissioner's objection decisions were wrong the task required of the applicant by s 14ZZK of the TAA in circumstances where the taxpayer did not call any witnesses and relied instead on inferences drawn from the evidence. I do not think the applicant has discharged that burden. The applicant has not persuaded me the land was anything other than a capital asset. The proceeds of the sale of the land should therefore be regarded as the proceeds of a mere realisation of a capital asset. The loss on that sale was a capital loss. The objection decisions under review ought to be affirmed in that respect. 49 On consideration of the grounds of appeal, the applicant's submissions, and Reasons for Decision of the Tribunal highlighted by the applicant, two issues emerge, namely: a. whether the Tribunal incorrectly applied the onus of proof borne by the applicant; and b. whether the Tribunal improperly applied the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298. 55 In relation to the second issue concerning the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298, the applicant contends as a ground of appeal that the Tribunal erred in law by correctly ruling that the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298 did not apply, but then in fact applying that rule. The key aspect of this well-known rule for present purposes is that the unexplained failure by a party to call evidence or witnesses may, not must, in appropriate circumstances lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence or missing material would not have assisted that party's case (see Heydon JD, Cross on Evidence (7th Australian ed, Butterworths, 2004) at p 39. 56 Although the applicant also referred to paras 35, 39, 40, 41 and 49 of the Tribunal's Reasons for Decision in connection with this question of law, this contention is particularly relevant to paras 28 and 35 where the Tribunal: &#8226; noted the rule, but observed that it should not apply it because the applicant had a reasonable excuse for the failure to call the witness (para 28); and &#8226; said that the applicant had not discharged its burden of proof (para 35). 57 Paragraphs 39, 40, and 41 relate to carrying forward losses and continuity of beneficial ownership (and hence are relevant to question e), whereas para 49 refers to the penalty imposed on the applicant (which I have already considered) and the alleged prosecution of Mr Doumany which I will discuss later in this judgment. 58 In para 28, the Tribunal made it clear that the task of the applicant in discharging its burden of proof was made more difficult because it did not call Mr Doumany as a witness. However the Senior Member also made it clear that he made his decision based upon the evidence that was before him, and provided reasons to this effect. I am not persuaded that that the Tribunal in fact applied the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298, either unconsciously (as submitted by the applicant) or otherwise. Given the history of this matter, and Mr Doumany's involvement in the affairs of the applicant and all relevant transactions the subject of this application, it is obvious that his evidence would have been important in these proceedings. In light of this, contrary to the submissions of the applicant, there were very good reasons for the Tribunal to take the view that the failure of the applicant to call Mr Doumany as a witness made the applicant's task of discharging its burden of proof more difficult in these proceedings. However this does not mean that the Tribunal drew inferences adverse to the applicant from its failure to call Mr Doumany as a witness. Further, the examination by the Tribunal of whether the loss should be characterised as income or capital, including consideration of the facts as presented to the Tribunal, suggests that the Tribunal did in fact give careful consideration to such evidence as was before it. 59 Accordingly the answer to question d raised on appeal is ""No"". 60 I have a number of observations concerning questions e and f. Does question e raise a question of law?"
Case1370,cited,Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400."
Case1371,cited,McAuliffe v Comcare [2002] FCA 769,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based. (see also, Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131 at 144 5, Deniz v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1983) 51 ALR 645 at 650, Repatriation Commission v Thompson 82 ALR at 358, Swift at 5,113, McAuliffe v Comcare [2002] FCA 769 at [51] , Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414 at [32] )"
Case1372,cited,McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284,"In its Notice of Appeal, the applicant linked this question of law with paras 27-30 and para 35 of the Reasons for Decision of the Tribunal. In these paragraphs, in the context of considering whether the loss the applicant sought to carry forward was more appropriately characterised as a capital or income loss, Senior Member McCabe said as follows: 27. Section 14ZZK(b) says the taxpayer has the burden of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently. The Commissioner's decision effectively creates a presumption the applicant must rebut if he or she is to succeed in an appeal: see, for example, McCormack v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 at 314-315 per Jacobs J. That may be a difficult task where the taxpayer does not call any witnesses to explain a paper trail that does not speak for itself, or which is consistent with the Commissioner's view or even ambiguous. 28. The Commissioner has asked me to draw adverse inferences against the taxpayer in light of the fact the applicant has not called Mr D to give evidence. Mr D was in the best position to explain the transactions into which the applicant entered. His evidence would probably have been of assistance to the Tribunal. Mr Hack, for the Commissioner, says the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 should apply. That rule permits me to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call the witness in appropriate circumstances. One of the circumstances in which I may not draw an adverse inference is where there is a reasonable excuse for the failure to call the witness. I think there is a reasonable excuse in this case. That excuse can be gleaned from the submissions made in relation to the application for a suppression order: see A Taxpayer and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 398. Mr D has apparently declined to answer questions on the basis he might expose himself to a criminal prosecution. There is little point in calling a witness in those circumstances. 29. While I decline to draw an adverse inference from Mr D's failure to appear, that failure inevitably makes it harder for the applicant to show the Commissioner's decision was wrong. 30. The starting point of the analysis is the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v NF Williams (1972) 72 ATC 4188 per Gibb J at 4195. If the asset was more like trading stock that was bought and sold (or bought, developed, sub-divided and sold) as part of a business of developing and dealing in land, the law might treat the proceeds of the sale as income : see, for example, Whitfords Beach Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1982) 82 ATC 4031. ... 35. I have already observed the applicant would have difficulty establishing the Commissioner's objection decisions were wrong the task required of the applicant by s 14ZZK of the TAA in circumstances where the taxpayer did not call any witnesses and relied instead on inferences drawn from the evidence. I do not think the applicant has discharged that burden. The applicant has not persuaded me the land was anything other than a capital asset. The proceeds of the sale of the land should therefore be regarded as the proceeds of a mere realisation of a capital asset. The loss on that sale was a capital loss. The objection decisions under review ought to be affirmed in that respect. 51 Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041, Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] . 53 In my view, this misconceives the obligation of the taxpayer when challenging a determination of the Commissioner under the legislation, and the onus borne by the taxpayer as a result of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act . As Jacobs J explained in McCormack 143 CLR at 314, there is, by virtue of the section, a rebuttable presumption of law that an assessment is not excessive, and the onus is on the taxpayer to rebut that presumption. This means, for example, that where the evidence is equivocal the applicant in an appeal before the Tribunal against an assessment fails to discharge its onus : Mason J in Gauci v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 54 ; (1975) 135 CLR 81 at 89-90, approved in McCormack 143 CLR by Gibbs J at 303-304, Stephen J at 306, Jacobs J at 314 and Murphy J at 323. Contending that the onus of proof under s 14ZZK(b) only arises in the limited circumstances submitted by the applicant misstates the effect of that provision. In my view no error of law appears in this respect from paras 27-30 and 35 of the Tribunal's Reasons for Decision."

Implicit in its powers are a number of restrictions. The appeal is expressly limited to error of law, which alleged error is the sole matter before this Court and is the only subject matter of any order made consequent on the appeal. The order which this Court can make after hearing the appeal is also similarly restricted to an order which is appropriate by reason of its decision. It follows that the only order which can be properly made is one the propriety of which is circumscribed by and necessary to reflect this Court's view on the alleged or found error of law. To go further I would see as amounting to exceeding the jurisdiction of this Court under this section. A power to make 'such order as it thinks appropriate by reason of its decision' is much more restrictive than a power 'to make such order as it sees fit' or a power 'to make a decision in substitution for the decision' the subject of the appeal.'... The powers of this Court on appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act are limited to consideration of alleged errors of law by the Tribunal and go no further.

Case1375,cited,Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997)."
Case1376,cited,Nozzi Pty Ltd Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 356,"The burden of proof is on the applicant to show that there was no intentional disregard of the ITAA 1936 or the regulations and that the penalty under s 226J should not have been imposed (cf Nozzi Pty Ltd Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 356 at [12] ). 43 As made clear by the Explanatory Memorandum to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill 1992 which introduced s 226J, s 226J requires knowledge by the taxpayer that, for example, it has claimed a deduction knowing that it is not allowable. Accordingly, ""intentional disregard"" of the ITAA 1936 or regulations requires, inter alia , an understanding by the taxpayer of the effect of the relevant legislation or regulations, an appreciation by the taxpayer of how that legislation or regulation applies to the circumstances of the taxpayer, and finally, deliberate conduct of the taxpayer so as to flout the ITAA 1936 or regulations. The legislation treats ""intentional disregard"" differently from, and more seriously than, negligence to comply with the Act (cf s 226G) or recklessness with regard to the correct operation of the Act (cf s 226H). 44 Whether the conduct of the applicant has satisfied s 226J requires findings of fact by the Tribunal."
Case1377,cited,Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income.

Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 62 The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based. (see also, Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131 at 144 5, Deniz v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1983) 51 ALR 645 at 650, Repatriation Commission v Thompson 82 ALR at 358, Swift at 5,113, McAuliffe v Comcare [2002] FCA 769 at [51] , Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414 at [32] )"
Case1378,cited,Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82,"Unfortunately question d was not the subject of oral submissions by the applicant during the hearing before me. Ms Brennan for the respondent however referred me to the decision of the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82. In that case however the Court noted that it was considering the principles of burden and onus of proof under s 120 (5) and (6) Veteran's Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ((1998) 83 FCR 82 at 95). 51 Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041, Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] ."

In itself, the question does not cavil with the legal approach of the Tribunal to the conceptualisation of continuity of beneficial ownership. In my view question e is not a question of law which attracts the jurisdiction of the Court under s 44(1) AAT Act . Does question f raise a question of law 66 Similarly, question f queries the finding of the Tribunal with respect to whether the applicant was carrying on the same business during the relevant period, without disputing the approach by the Tribunal to the issue. Question f seems to seek a review of the decision of the Tribunal purely on the facts. In my view, for the reasons I have just outlined, question f also does not raise a question of law. Is it necessary to answer questions e and f anyway?"
Case1380,cited,Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400."

QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale .

In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 30 In identifying the purpose of a corporate taxpayer, it is important indeed decisive to consider the purpose of those who control the taxpayer: Ruhamah 41 CLR at 160, 162, 166; Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 370. So, for example, in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 where ownership and control of the taxpayer company changed from that of individuals whose purpose in forming the taxpayer was for the taxpayer to hold land for the domestic purposes of those shareholders, to that of three companies which acquired the taxpayer for the purpose of carrying out a business operation of land development, a key issue in the decision was the fact of that change of control and the intentions of the new shareholders of the taxpayer."
Case1382,cited,Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32).

Case1383,cited,Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188,"However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997). Relevance of purpose"
Case1384,cited,Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA,"In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 35 I also note comments of the Full Court in Cooling 22 FCR 42 and Selleck [1997] 799 FCA, referred to earlier in this judgment, that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities."

QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient."
Case1386,cited,"Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1","The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based. (see also, Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131 at 144 5, Deniz v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1983) 51 ALR 645 at 650, Repatriation Commission v Thompson 82 ALR at 358, Swift at 5,113, McAuliffe v Comcare [2002] FCA 769 at [51] , Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414 at [32] )"
Case1387,cited,United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400."
Case1388,cited,Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889,"Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041, Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] ."
Case1389,cited,Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based. (see also, Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131 at 144 5, Deniz v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1983) 51 ALR 645 at 650, Repatriation Commission v Thompson 82 ALR at 358, Swift at 5,113, McAuliffe v Comcare [2002] FCA 769 at [51] , Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414 at [32] )"
Case1390,applied,Westfield Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342). Nature of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 28 The meaning of ""profit-making scheme"" is well-known. It is useful to note in the present context that: &#8226; it is not necessary that the profit-making scheme was specific in detail, or that every step which culminated in the profit was planned or foreseen ( Westfield 28 FCR at 344); and &#8226; the mode of achieving that profit must be one contemplated by the taxpayer as at least one of the alternatives by which the profit could be realised ( Westfield 28 FCR at 344). 29 As Hill J further noted in Westfield 28 FCR at 333-345: (I)t is difficult to conceive of a case where a taxpayer would be said to have made a profit from the carrying on, or carrying out, of a profit-making scheme, where, in the case of the scheme involving the acquisition and resale of land, there was, at the time of acquisition, no purpose of resale of land, but only the possibility (present, one may observe, in the case of every acquisition of land) that the land may be resold. The same may be said to be the case where s 25(1) of the Act is involved. As the court observed in Myer...the property which generates the gain must be acquired in an operation of business or commercial transaction 'for the purposes of profit-making by the means giving rise to the profit. Whose purpose 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient."
Case1391,referred to,Whitaker v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 261,"Even if the offer made by the respondents by letter dated 27 March 2007 was commensurate with the overall financial result to flow from the orders I made on 30 July 2008, and I hasten to add that I do not think it is, the ground on which the motion is brought is misconceived. As Lockhart J said in Whitaker v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 261 at 269: 'The primary purpose of an award of pre-judgment interest is to compensate a successful plaintiff for the loss or detriment which he or she has suffered by being kept out of his or her money during the relevant period; that is to compensate the plaintiff for having been deprived of the use of the money: Ruby v Marsh [1975] HCA 32 ; (1975) 132 CLR 642 ; Batchelor v Burke [1981] HCA 30 ; (1981) 148 CLR 448 ; and MBP (SA) Pty Limited v Gogic [1991] HCA 3 ; (1991) 171 CLR 657. See P D Finn (ed), Essays on Damages (1st ed, 1992) and in particular the essay by J L R Davis, ""Interest as Compensation"", pp 149-152.' The applicant has been without its money since 28 January 2004 and that remains the case. It is only appropriate that it should have interest on that money up to the date of judgment. 11 The motion for the vacation of Order 6 is dismissed. 12 The respondents' notice of motion seeks (at [2]) the vacation of Orders 7 and 8 made on 30 July 2008 and their variation based on the matters set out in the affidavit of Ms Ellis sworn 5 August 2005. It does not say how they should be varied. Nor do their written submissions. What the respondents' notice of motion does seek (at [3]) is an order that the applicant pay the respondents' costs (on an indemnity or, alternatively, party-party basis) from 21 April 2007 or such other time as the Court thinks fit. On the hearing of the motion, the further alternative was introduced, namely, that each party pay its own costs from that date. Presumably, implicit in all this is that the first, second and third respondents should pay the applicant's costs of the application as ordered by Order 7, but only up to 21 April 2007. On the hearing of the motion, nothing was said about the second limb of Order 7, namely, that the first, second and third respondents pay the fourth, fifth and sixth respondents' costs of defending the application. Nor was anything said about Order 8 that the cross-claimant pay the first and second cross-respondents' costs of defending the cross-claim."

Allsop J there observed: [143] The question of deceptive similarity must be judged by a comparison different from the side by side comparison undertaken to assess substantial identity; the question being the likelihood of deception or confusion from a recollection or impression of the registered mark. Thus, a side by side comparison is inadequate, and too narrow a test. The comparison is between, on the one hand, the impression based on recollection of the registered mark used in a normal or fair manner that persons of ordinary intelligence and memory would have, and, on the other hand, the impressions that such persons would get from the impugned mark as it appears in the use complained of... 101 Section 92(1) and (4)(b) of the 1995 Act provide as follows: Application for removal of trade mark from Register etc. (1) Subject to subsection (3), a person may apply to the Registrar to have a trade mark that is or may be registered removed from the Register. ... (4) An application under subsection (1) or (3) (non-use application) may be made on either or both of the following grounds, and on no other grounds: ... (b) that the trade mark has remained registered for a continuous period of 3 years ending one month before the day on which the non use application is filed, and, at no time during that period, the person who was then the registered owner: (i) used the trade mark in Australia; or (ii) used the trade mark in good faith in Australia; in relation to the goods and/or services to which the application relates. Section 7 further defines that which constitutes the "" use "" of a trade mark. An "" authorised use "" of a trade mark is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the owner: s 7(3). Section 8 defines that which constitutes an "" authorised use "". See: Yau's Entertainment Pty Ltd v Asia Television Ltd [2002] FCA 338 at [75] [81], [2002] FCAFC 78 ; 54 IPR 1 at 16 per Hely J (Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ agreeing). The term "" during "" does not mean "" throughout "" so as to require a regular and continuous course of conduct for the whole period: NSW Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd (No 1) (1989) 14 IPR 26 at 44 per Gummow J. See: Luck J, Case Note (1990) 1 IPJ 63. 132 The first contention advanced on behalf of Gallo Winery was that the prior registered owner of the trade mark, Mr Houlihan, licensed it to Barefoot Cellars and exercised quality control over the BAREFOOT wine to which the mark was applied. The fact that such wines were sold and offered for sale by Beach Avenue Wholesalers during the relevant period -- it was submitted -- was sufficient to constitute a use of the mark by Barefoot Cellars and, in turn, Mr Houlihan. That was a "" use "", so it was contended, by the then registered proprietor during the non-use period. 133 Neither Mr Houlihan nor any officer of Barefoot Cellars knew that the BAREFOOT wine exported to Germany in 2001 may ultimately find its way to Australia. But knowledge on the part of Mr Houlihan or Barefoot Cellars that its wine would or may find its way to Australia and be offered for sale, is said by Gallo Winery to be irrelevant. 137 Notwithstanding the views expressed by those authors, it is not considered that there could have been a "" use "" of the BAREFOOT trade mark during the 2004 2007 period by the registered owner simply by reason of the fact that BAREFOOT wine happened to be offered for sale or was in fact sold in Australia during that period. 138 There was certainly no agreement or other arrangement as between either Mr Houlihan or Barefoot Cellars and Beach Avenue Wholesalers whereby the BAREFOOT wine was to be imported, whether from Germany or elsewhere, and later sold or offered for sale in Australia. 139 In the circumstances of the present proceedings, it is not considered that there was any "" use "" of the BAREFOOT trade mark by the registered proprietor in Australia arising merely by reason of the fact that the BAREFOOT wine, or some of the wine exported originally to Germany, by some unexplained circuitous route ultimately arrived on Australian shores and was thereafter available for sale in Australia."

Case1397,distinguished,Buying Systems (Australia) Pty Ltd v Studio Srl [1995] FCA 1063 ; (1995) 30 IPR 517,"These negotiations, contends Gallo Winery , constituted a use of the BAREFOOT trade mark in Australia. Such negotiations, contends Gallo Winery , provide evidence which is at least as strong, if not stronger, than that which constituted a use in Buying Systems (Australia) Pty Ltd v Studio Srl [1995] FCA 1063 ; (1995) 30 IPR 517. 164 In Buying Systems there was activity aimed at setting up a new fashion magazine. That activity included obtaining business cards, printing letterheads, and obtaining advertising space. Gummow J concluded (at 520): These steps amount to sufficient activity by the opponent to produce the result that the applicant for registration at the date of its application on 8 December 1983 could not accurately put itself forward as claiming to be proprietor of the relevant mark. The activities of the opponent were sufficient to constitute a relevant use of the mark in Australia for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between it and the new magazine. This is not a case where those activities occurred without any existing intention to offer or supply the magazine in trade. The case is quite different from activities of the nature discussed in Moorgate. As I have already indicated, the material before this court is far more extensive than that which was before the registrar. 166 Buying Systems , it is considered, provides no support to the case now sought to be advanced by Gallo Winery. Reference may also be made to NSW Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd (No 1) (1989) 14 IPR 26. Gummow J there concluded that there had been a use of the mark in issue by reason of such facts during the statutory period as the provision of art work to enable the manufacture of packaging and the production of promotional videos. 167 In the present proceedings there were undoubtedly discussions between Gallo Winery and McWilliams Wines as to the launch in Australia of BAREFOOT wine. But by May 2007 the negotiations had not proceeded beyond just that, negotiations. Compare: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 at [40] , [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 at 179. There was unquestionably an intention to launch BAREFOOT wine in Australia "" in around September 2007 "". But, and unlike the position in Buying Systems , there had been no step taken during the non-use period comparable to the placing of advertisements or the printing of letterheads or business cards. The only step which had been taken was the unilateral step taken by McWilliams Wines to allocate some of its wine. Gallo Winery was pleased that such a step had been taken as it preserved the possibility of a launch in September 2007. That was a step taken, however, by McWilliams Wines and not by Gallo Winery."
Case1398,followed,"C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 , 52 IPR 42","The comparison, it should be noted, is different to that undertaken in a passing off action where the plaintiff points to the goodwill built up around a mark by reason of prior use and then points to the conduct of the defendant as leading to deception, or perhaps merely confusion, and the consequent damage to that goodwill of the plaintiff: Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss &amp; Co (1994) 49 FCR 89 at 128 9 per Gummow J. Essentially what is required when considering whether a mark is deceptively similar to another is a comparison between the mark of the registered owner and that of the alleged infringer: C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [44] , [2000] FCA 1539 ; 52 IPR 42 at 62. Ryan, Branson and Lehane JJ there considered that it was not appropriate to undertake a wider inquiry of the kind undertaken in a passing off action or in a proceeding in which a contravention of Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is alleged. 198 The discretion presently conferred by s 101(3) of the 1995 Act, it has been said, confers a "" broad discretion "": C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [72] , [2000] FCA 1539 ; 52 IPR 42 at 73.

Lander J there indicated that he was of the view that it was not reasonable not to remove the mark in issue. Of the discretion, his Honour concluded: [97] ... There are significant differences in the section considered by the Court of Appeal in Lyons [(1959) 76 RPC 120] and s 101(3). In the English section, regard had to be had to the bona fide use of the trade mark during the relevant period. No such regard is had in s 101(3). It is always dangerous to have regard to a statement of principle in relation to the exercise of a discretion in a section in an Act which is not in pari materia with a section of a second Act for the purpose of considering the way in which a discretion should be exercised in that second Act. [98] In Upjohn [(1998) 42 IPR 576] it was said that the power may be applied in ""exceptional circumstances"". Section 101(3) does not say that. There is no warrant to read the expression ""exceptional circumstances"" into the subsection. That would be to give the subsection a construction contrary to its express terms. In my opinion, the discretion which is to be exercised under s 101(3) is to be exercised as the subsection itself says, ""when it is reasonable to do so"". To suggest that the party against whom the non-use has been put in a case such as this should establish exceptional circumstances is to put too high a hurdle in that party's path. 207 The present proceedings, it is considered, stand in stark contrast to those confronting both the trial judge and the Full Court in C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 , 52 IPR 42. The trial judge there had indicated that he would have allowed the mark to remain registered, even had it not been used. The registered proprietor of the mark had died in 1972 and no steps had been taken to transfer the mark until 1997. The beneficial interest in the mark had at all times resided directly or indirectly in members of the Henschke family. The only "" formal "" deception which could be pointed to was an impression that it may have been the partnership, rather than the executors, who owned the "" Hill of Grace "" trade mark. The persons using the mark were the persons who gave the mark its value.

Case1399,followed,"Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 , 202 CLR 45","Although the "" guiding principle behind the discretion is public interest, particularly in the integrity of the register "" ( Kowa Co Ltd v Organon [2005] FCA 1282 at [92] , [2005] FCA 1282 ; 223 ALR 27 at 41 2 per Lander J), the private commercial interests of both Gallo Winery and Lion Nathan remain matters which may be taken into account when exercising the discretion. Trade mark law, it has been recognised, is more complex than is suggested by the proposition that the supreme -- or, at least -- a predominant interest is the maintenance of the integrity of the Register: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 at [40] , [2000] HCA 12 ; 202 CLR 45 at 65. Speaking of the 1955 Act, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ there pointed out the balance struck by the legislation between various interests. Both the interests of the consuming public and the interests of traders have to be recognised. Their Honours observed that: [42] ... the Australian legislation has manifested from time to time a varying accommodation of commercial and the consuming public's interests. There is the interest of consumers in recognising a trade mark as a badge of origin of goods or services and in avoiding deception or confusion as to that origin. There is the interest of traders, both in protecting their goodwill through the creation of a statutory species of property protected by the action against infringement, and in turning this property to valuable account by licensing or assignment. The provisions of the 1955 Act with respect to defensive registrations and certification marks were recognitions that the interests of the owners of registered trade marks may go beyond that of indicating trade origin. In Yale Electric Corporation v Robertson [(1928) 26 F 2d 972 at 973], Judge Learned Hand said of this interest: ""that one merchant shall not divert customers from another by representing what he sells as emanating from the second. This has been, and perhaps even more now is, the whole Law and the Prophets on the subject, though it assumes many guises."" In this decade, legislation in the United States, the United Kingdom, and now in Australia to varying degrees has extended the infringement action to restrain activities which are likely adversely to affect the interests of the owner of a ""famous"" or ""well-known"" trade mark by the ""dilution"" of its distinctive qualities or of its value to the owner."

See: Carnival Cruise Lines Inc v Sitmar Cruises Ltd (1994) 120 ALR 495 at 510 per Gummow J. 152 The second way in which Gallo Winery contends that there has been a use of the mark during the non-use period is again to rely upon the fact that BAREFOOT wine was sold by Beach Avenue Wholesalers and offered for sale during the non-use period. This, together with the quality control exercised by Mr Houlihan, it is submitted, made Beach Avenue Wholesalers an "" authorised user "" of the mark within the meaning of s 8(1) of the 1995 Act. Its use of the mark, it is contended, is an "" authorised use "" within the meaning of s 8(2). 153 Section 8 of the 1995 Act provides as follows: Definitions of authorised user and authorised use (1) A person is an authorised user of a trade mark if the person uses the trade mark in relation to goods or services under the control of the owner of the trade mark. (2) The use of a trade mark by an authorised user of the trade mark is an authorised use of the trade mark to the extent only that the user uses the trade mark under the control of the owner of the trade mark. (3) If the owner of a trade mark exercises quality control over goods or services: (a) dealt with or provided in the course of trade by another person; and (b) in relation to which the trade mark is used; the other person is taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to use the trade mark in relation to the goods or services under the control of the owner. (4) If: (a) a person deals with or provides, in the course of trade, goods or services in relation to which a trade mark is used; and (b) the owner of the trade mark exercises financial control over the other person's relevant trading activities; the other person is taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to use the trade mark in relation to the goods or services under the control of the owner.

Case1402,distinguished,"Colorado Group Ltd v Standbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 , 243 ALR 127","Lion Nathan placed reliance upon Colorado Group Ltd v Standbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 , 164 FCR 506. Just as in the Colorado case, Lion Nathan contends that the image cannot be divorced from the word such that the words alone had the capacity to distinguish the wine. In reaching a like conclusion in the Colorado case, Allsop J concluded: [110] Here, though the evidence was less than precise as to what the mark plus device use was by CGL, the examples in evidence reveal an important, perhaps even dominant, effect of the word ""Colorado"", but always with a device. That device was part of the trade mark use; it had a capacity to distinguish. It did not, in my view, operate as a separate mark, nor as a mere descriptor. It operated as part of a combination with the word ""Colorado"", in part reinforcing it. In these circumstances, I agree with the primary judge's concluded view that though the word ""Colorado"" is important in the impression, it cannot be said to have been used alone, rather than as part of a composite mark (with the device) to show origin. Kenny and Gyles JJ gave separate judgments but also agreed with Allsop J. 186 Although it may be accepted that a combination of a word and an image may in some circumstances strip, in the mind of a consumer, the association with a trade source previously associated with the word alone, such is not the present case. Rejected is the contention of Lion Nathan that -- if there was a use of a trade mark during the non-use period -- it was the use of a mark other than the word "" BAREFOOT "" . If there was a use of a mark during the non-use period, the addition of the image of the bare foot did not have the consequence that the word itself as a trade mark was not also being used. 187 One of the final contentions advanced by Gallo Winery was that any such use as there was of the trade mark during the non-use period was a use "" in good faith "" within the meaning of s 100(1)(c) of the 1995 Act. 188 Lion Nathan denies that any use was a use "" in good faith "". Upon its analysis, during the non-use period there were 59 bottles provided to customers, of which 18 were given away free. Forty-three bottles, according to their analysis, were provided to Centro Euro Wines ."

It is a German word and, not being a word of everyday usage in the English language, its use would unquestionably leave an impression on the mind of a person. The word "" RADLER "", it is considered, would leave an impression on the mind of a person who knew what the word meant and would leave an even firmer impression upon the mind of a person who had no such knowledge. And it is a word given prominence in the Lion Nathan sign. But those factors either alone or in combination would not be such as to remove the likelihood of deception or confusion. Contrast: Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Ltd v Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 196 , 209 ALR 1. 63 An essential feature common to both the mark of Gallo Winery and the sign as pleaded by Lion Nathan remains the word "" BAREFOOT "" which, it is considered, would leave a considerable impression on the mind of a consumer of ordinary intelligence. Notwithstanding the distinctiveness which the word "" RADLER "" brings to the sign of Lion Nathan , it would not be sufficient to remove the likelihood of deception otherwise arising. 64 Again, it should be noted, any deceptive similarity with the Gallo Winery mark would not have arisen had Lion Nathan been free to rely upon the combination of words and the image of the bare foot."
Case1405,cited,""" Daiquiri Rum "" Trade Mark [1969] RPC 600","The Applicant accepts that other cases which have resolved whether the goods there in issue were "" goods of the same description "" are not determinative. But it does contend that some guidance may be gleaned from decisions which have held or suggested that the following are "" goods of the same description "": namely, "" rum and a rum cocktail or a Daiquiri "" ("" Daiquiri Rum "" Trade Mark [1969] RPC 600 at 609 per Lord Reid, at 613 per Lord Morris, at 615 per Lord Pearce); wines and spirits ( In re Australian Wine Importers' Trade Mark (1889) 6 RPC 311) ; and beer and rum ( In re Turney and Sons' Trade Mark (1893) 11 RPC 37 at 44 5). Of these decisions, it is of significance to note that in the Australian Wine Importers case the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a decision of Kay J. Cotton LJ held at 316: ... Well, it is not confined to the same goods, but it is ""the same goods or description of goods ;"" and if it were necessary to decide it absolutely on that point, my opinion would be that there was an application for registration with respect to the same description of goods ; because although wine and whiskey, and wine and spirits are in a great many ways considered as different goods, yet we are not considering here how chemists would describe them, but whether manufacturers would describe them as being the same description of goods or not. We find that they are goods which are generally sold by the same persons, and for the purposes of trade may, in some respects, be considered as the same description of goods; for they are both alcoholic, and although there may be differences in them, they may fairly be considered as coming within the same description of goods, though they are not the same goods. ... Lindley LJ similarly concluded at 318 19: Of course one has to look at the trade. One must look at it from a business point of view. They are alcoholic and spirituous. They are sold in this country constantly by the same people. Wine and spirit dealers are common enough in this country, and I am not sure that they are not the same description of goods ; but whether they are or not, it seems to me that they are so uncommonly near the line that we ought not to depart from the view taken by Mr. Justice Kay, and say to the Comptroller, ""You must register in favour of these wine merchants a mark which is already on the Register in favour of a spirit merchant who is also a wine merchant."" It appears to me that Mr. Justice Kay has taken the right view of the case, and that we ought not to interfere with his Order. These observations disclose, at the very least, that questions of fine judgment may be involved."

And as from January 2005 to May 2007, there is no evidence that Gallo Winery itself exported BAREFOOT wine to Australia or caused it to be sold or offered for sale in Australia. 134 Reliance is placed by Gallo Winery upon both the decision, and the following observations of Windeyer J, in Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis &amp; Goldstein Ltd [1967] HCA 51 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254 at 266 7: ... As a proposition of law it is no doubt perfectly correct that the goods when sold and delivered in London no longer belonged to the manufacturer. But when it is said that a trade mark is used to distinguish the goods of one man from those of another, that abbreviated statement obviously does not refer to the goods of the owner of the mark in the sense of goods which he owns or possesses. After the goods have been sold by him his mark may still, using the definition of trade mark in the Act, be used in relation to those goods for the purpose of indicating a connexion in the course of trade between them and him, the registered proprietor of the mark. The manufacturer who sells goods, marked with his mark, to a warehouseman, wholesaler or retailer does not, in my view, thereupon cease to use the mark in respect of those goods. The mark is his property although the goods are not; and the mark is being used by him so long as the goods are in the course of trade and it is indicative of their origin, that is as his products. Goods remain in the course of trade so long as they are upon a market for sale. Only when they are bought for consumption do they cease to be in the course of trade. ... Reliance is also placed upon the commentary on that decision by the authors of Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (3 rd ed, 2003). 135 The decision of Windeyer J, it may be noted, was affirmed by Barwick CJ, McTiernan, Taylor and Owen JJ. On appeal their Honours relevantly concluded as follows: By the Act a trade mark means ""a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating, or so as to indicate, a connexion in the course of trade between the goods and a person who has the right, either as proprietor or as registered user, to use the mark, whether with or without an indication of the identity of that person"" and ""use"" in s. 23 must be understood in this context. Its denotation is not limited by any concept of the physical use of a tangible object and we have no doubt that when an overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country, by means of sales to Australian retail houses, goods bearing his mark and the goods, bearing his mark, are displayed or offered for sale or sold in this country, the use of the mark is that of the manufacturer. Indeed, in this case, the respondent is the only person who has the right to use the mark and the retailer to whom the goods have been sold for re-sale does not, in any relevant sense, use it.: [1967] HCA 51 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254 at 271. Their Honours also went on to conclude: It is conceded that there is a use of the mark in this country by an overseas proprietor where he advertises his mark in this country. Further, it is conceded that there is a use by such a manufacturer of his mark where the property in the goods sold by him by wholesale to traders in this country does not pass until their arrival into Australia. It would, in our view, be an extraordinary result if the maintenance of the Australian trade mark of an overseas manufacturer who is projecting goods of his manufacture on to the Australian market by means of sales to retail houses here can be made to depend upon whether the property in the goods the subject of such sales passes on shipment or upon or after their arrival in Australia.: [1967] HCA 51 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254 at 271 2. See also: Colman W J, Use of a Trade Mark in Australia (1968 1971) 6 Syd LR 52. 136 The commentary on that decision in Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off is as follows: Use through intermediaries [2.175] If a trader uses a sign to distinguish the origin of a product, that sign should continue to do so as the product passes through the hands of others on its way to the ultimate consumer. Each time that the product is ""traded"" there will be, for the purposes of the 1995 Act, a use of the sign by the first trader to distinguish that trader's dealing with the product. The ""ultimate consumer"", submits Gallo Winery, was the Australian purchaser. 140 In Estex Clothing the London manufacturer knew that its goods had been sold into Australia. But Gallo Winery contends that the result in that decision would have been the same even had the manufacturer not known to whom the goods were sold or the market into which they were to be sold. So much, contends Gallo Winery , is supported by the reliance placed by Windeyer J on Jackson &amp; Co v Napper (1886) 35 Ch D 162 , 4 RPC 45 at 57 9, a decision which Windeyer J observed "" contains much that is instructive "". In a passage commencing at 178, Stirling J observed: The case as to the other five classes of goods rests on different considerations, and raises the question what is meant by the user of a trade-mark in England. Now, in considering that, I do not think I can do better than refer to what Lord Westbury said in McAndrew v. Bassett [4 DJ&amp;S 380] with respect to the essential ingredients of a trade-mark. He says [4 DJ&amp;S 384]: ""An element of the right to the property in a trade-mark may be represented as being the fact of the article being in the market as a vendible article, with that stamp or trade-mark, at the time when the defendants imitate it. The essential ingredients for constituting an infringement of that right probably would be found to be no other than these : first, that the mark has been applied by the plaintiffs properly (that is to say), that they have not copied any other person's mark, and that the mark does not involve any false representation ; secondly, that the article so marked is actually a vendible article in the market ; and, thirdly, that the defendants, knowing that to be so, have imitated the mark for the purpose of passing in the market other articles of a similar description."" It seems to me, according to that passage from Lord Westbury's judgment, that the trade-mark has been used in England if you find that the articles marked with it have been actually vendible articles in the market in England ; and that is the test which I proceed to apply to the various classes of goods which remain. Gallo Winery's contention is that knowledge or intention on the part of the registered proprietor is not determinative; that which matters is whether its goods, to which its trade mark had been applied, were on the market at all. The trade mark, it is contended, is used in Australia if the product to which the mark is applied is on the Australian market. 141 The decision in Estex Clothing , it is considered, does not support such a contention so widely expressed. 142 Rejected in Estex Clothing was the proposition that the fact that property had passed in the goods outside of Australia was sufficient in itself to establish that there had not been a use of the trade mark in Australia. And, as is correctly submitted by Lion Nathan, if the sale by the retail house of the goods bearing the overseas trader's mark was sufficient on its own to constitute use by the overseas trader, there would have been no reason for the Full Court to have gone on to emphasise the acts of the overseas trader in projecting the goods into the Australian market. 143 In the circumstances of the present proceedings, and leaving intention or knowledge aside, there are no objective criteria comparable to those that existed in Estex Clothing such that it can be concluded that the registered proprietor of the trade mark "" projected "" its goods into any market other than Germany. 144 Such authorities as have discussed Estex Clothing have not confronted the factual situation where goods have been exported to one country and thereafter arrived in Australia without the knowledge of the registered owner of the trade mark, or without any agreement or understanding being in place whereby the goods exported were to make their way or may make their way into Australian trade, or without any objective criteria such that it could be concluded that goods had been projected into the Australian market. 145 In Estex Clothing the goods exported were being forwarded from England to Australia, and it is not considered that the language employed by their Honours should be construed as contemplating anything beyond what they literally said. By exporting the goods from England into Australia the "" overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country ... goods bearing his mark "". Such other authorities also seem to contemplate that there has to be an export of goods from overseas into Australia. Thus, in Brother Industries Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 , 163 FCR 530 , Tamberlin J referred to Estex Clothing and summarised its effect as follows: [42] ... Put another way, where an overseas company has registered a trade mark in Australia for products it exports to the Australian market, then it is that company, when and if it distributes the goods into Australia, which can be said to have ""used"" its trade mark. See also: Asia Television Ltd v Yau's Entertainment Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 838 at [9] , [2000] FCA 838 ; 49 IPR 264 at 268 per Gyles J. 147 Estex Clothing , it is considered, provides no support for a conclusion that the export of wine from the United States into Germany in February 2001 was also the projection in a comparable manner of that wine into the Australian market as it occurred over a year later in July 2002. 148 This conclusion is consistent with the interpretation of Estex Clothing provided by Aickin J in Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670. His Honour there referred to Estex Clothing and continued (at 688): It was argued that Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty. Ltd. v. Ellis and Goldstein Ltd. decided that a retailer who sold imported goods bearing an Australian registered trade mark did not use the mark, and that therefore a ""distributor"" did not use a mark which was already on the goods. In my opinion the Estex Case is not authority for that proposition. It is authority for the proposition that the foreign owner of an Australian mark uses it in Australia when he sells goods for delivery abroad to Australian retailers and those retailers import them into Australia for sale and there sell them. It demonstrates that such a situation does not differ from that where he sells the goods for delivery in Australia to the retailer or where he advertises the goods in Australia. ..."

Case1413,considered,Hermes Trade Mark [1982] RPC 425,"Reliance is placed by Gallo Winery upon the obiter comments of Falconer J in Hermes Trade Mark [1982] RPC 425. In that decision an application was made for the removal of the trade mark "" Hermes "", in relation to watches, for non-use during a five year period. That application was rejected. Falconer J nevertheless went on to observe that, had it been necessary to exercise the statutory discretion conferred by s 52 of the Trade Marks Act 1938 (UK), his Honour would have allowed the mark to remain on the Register. Relevant to that conclusion were five factors: there had been no abandonment of the trade mark; the registered proprietors still had a residual reputation in the mark; there had been sales by the registered proprietors of watches since the relevant period ended; the applicants for removal had entered the market without having taken steps to ascertain from the Register whether anyone had a right to exclude their use of the mark; and the registered proprietors were not aware of the applicant's sales under the "" Hermes "" mark. 203 That list of considerations is, obviously enough, not an exhaustive catalogue of factors that may be taken into account. But it does provide some assistance. No attempt was made in the present proceedings to establish any reputation or sale of Gallo Winery's wines in Australia under the trade mark BAREFOOT prior to May 2004. No question of any "" residual reputation "" thus arises in the present proceedings by reason of earlier sales in Australia. But there have been sales in Australia since May 2007 of Gallo Winery's wines using the BAREFOOT trade mark and there certainly has been no intention on the part of Gallo Winery to abandon its use of that mark. And Lion Nathan knew that there was a risk that Gallo Winery may have been able to establish a use of its mark during the three year period 2004 2007. 204 As is frequently the case with any exercise of discretion, the considerations relevant to the exercise are seldom all one way."

Case1417,considered,"Jackson &amp; Co v Napper (1886) 35 Ch D 162 , 4 RPC 45","In Estex Clothing the London manufacturer knew that its goods had been sold into Australia. But Gallo Winery contends that the result in that decision would have been the same even had the manufacturer not known to whom the goods were sold or the market into which they were to be sold. So much, contends Gallo Winery , is supported by the reliance placed by Windeyer J on Jackson &amp; Co v Napper (1886) 35 Ch D 162 , 4 RPC 45 at 57 9, a decision which Windeyer J observed "" contains much that is instructive "". In a passage commencing at 178, Stirling J observed: The case as to the other five classes of goods rests on different considerations, and raises the question what is meant by the user of a trade-mark in England. Now, in considering that, I do not think I can do better than refer to what Lord Westbury said in McAndrew v. Bassett [4 DJ&amp;S 380] with respect to the essential ingredients of a trade-mark. He says [4 DJ&amp;S 384]: ""An element of the right to the property in a trade-mark may be represented as being the fact of the article being in the market as a vendible article, with that stamp or trade-mark, at the time when the defendants imitate it. The essential ingredients for constituting an infringement of that right probably would be found to be no other than these : first, that the mark has been applied by the plaintiffs properly (that is to say), that they have not copied any other person's mark, and that the mark does not involve any false representation ; secondly, that the article so marked is actually a vendible article in the market ; and, thirdly, that the defendants, knowing that to be so, have imitated the mark for the purpose of passing in the market other articles of a similar description."" It seems to me, according to that passage from Lord Westbury's judgment, that the trade-mark has been used in England if you find that the articles marked with it have been actually vendible articles in the market in England ; and that is the test which I proceed to apply to the various classes of goods which remain. Gallo Winery's contention is that knowledge or intention on the part of the registered proprietor is not determinative; that which matters is whether its goods, to which its trade mark had been applied, were on the market at all. The trade mark, it is contended, is used in Australia if the product to which the mark is applied is on the Australian market."

Case1419,distinguished,Jonathan Ross Sceats v Jonathan Sceats Design Pty Ltd (1990) 17 IPR 28,"In addition to contending that the Gallo Winery trade mark should be removed for non-use, the Respondent further maintains (at least in its written submissions) that the "" sign "" that it uses in marketing its beer is the words "" BAREFOOT RADLER "" and the image of a bare foot; denies that the sign BAREFOORT RADLER is "" substantially identical or deceptively similar to "" Gallo Winery's BAREFOOT trade mark; denies that the goods in relation to which the sign is used are "" goods of the same description as wines "" and contends that its use is "" not likely to deceive or cause confusion "". 23 The resolution of these competing submissions involves a resolution of the following questions, namely: (i) what is the "" sign "" being used as a trade mark by Lion Nathan ? (ii) is the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan "" substantially identical with "" the trade mark of Gallo Winery ? (iii) is the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan "" deceptively similar to "" the trade mark of Gallo Winery ? (iv) are the radler beers of Lion Nathan "" goods of the same description "" as the BAREFOOT wine of Gallo Winery ? (v) is the manner in which Lion Nathan uses its sign "" not likely to deceive or cause confusion ""? (vi) has there been a "" non-use "" of the BAREFOOT trade mark during the period from 7 May 2004 to 8 May 2007? The resolution of this question, as it was advanced in submissions, separately involves a consideration as to: (a) whether there were sales of the BAREFOOT wine during the non-use period; (b) whether the wine was offered for sale during the non-use period; (c) if the wine was sold or offered for sale during the non-use period, whether there was a use of the trade mark by Barefoot Cellars as an authorised user; (d) if the wine was sold or offered for sale during the non-use period, whether there was a use of the trade mark by Beach Avenue Wholesalers as an authorised user; (e) whether the negotiations as between Gallo Winery and McWilliams Wines during the non-use period constituted a use of the trade mark; (f) whether there was an "" obstacle "" to the use of the Gallo Winery trade mark; (g) even if there was a use, which mark was in fact being used; and (h) whether any use was a use "" in good faith "". (vii) if there has been a "" non-use "" of the trade mark by Gallo Winery , should the discretion conferred by s 101(3) of the 1995 Act be exercised so as to allow its trade mark to remain on the Register? Depending upon the manner in which one or other of these questions may be answered, other questions may not necessarily have to be answered. With the concurrence of the parties, however, the course has been taken of answering each of these questions should the matter proceed further. 24 Section 120(2) dictates that Lion Nathan infringes the trade mark of Gallo Winery if Lion Nathan "" uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to "" the trade mark of Gallo Winery . The term "" sign "" is itself broadly defined by s 6 as including: ... the following or any combination of the following, namely, any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device, brand, heading, label, ticket, aspect of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent. 25 The trade mark of Gallo Winery is the word "" BAREFOOT "". 26 In the present proceedings there is a dispute at the outset as to the ability of Lion Nathan to rely upon any sign other than the word "" BAREFOOT "" or the combination of words "" BAREFOOT RADLER "". The dispute centres upon whether the Amended Defence so confines Lion Nathan or whether Lion Nathan is otherwise free to contend that its sign also incorporates the image of a bare foot. 31 Lion Nathan contends that as a matter of fact, the "" sign "" which it is using for the purposes of s 120 is a combination of the words and the image -- and further contends that such a finding of fact is not to be denied by the pleadings. Its position is that: (i) its Amended Defence is simply a response to the allegations being made against it and there was no obligation or requirement placed upon it to positively set forth what was the "" sign "" in fact being used by it for the purposes of s 120; and (ii) any unfairness to the Applicant is removed by reason of its written Outline of Opening Submissions , available at the outset of the hearing, which stated that: [46] The Court should find that the trade mark used by the Respondent to distinguish the Respondent's beer from other beers on the market comprises the words BAREFOOT RADLER and an image of a bare foot. ... 32 Notwithstanding paragraph [46] of its Outline of Opening Submissions , it is considered that the Amended Defence confines Lion Nathan to the position that the "" sign "" upon which it places reliance for the purposes of defending the current proceedings is the combination alone of the words "" BAREFOOT RADLER "". Albeit in response to the allegation in the Further Amended Statement of Claim that it has infringed Gallo Winery's BAREFOOT trade mark, the Amended Defence states in part that it "" denies that the sign to be used by the Respondent, BAREFOOT RADLER, is substantially identical or deceptively similar to the Applicant's BAREFOOT Trade Mark "". This can only be construed as conveying to the Applicant at least two things: (i) the position that the Respondent denies that the sign to be used is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the Applicant's sign; and (ii) the sign "" to be used "" by the Respondent, and to be relied upon in resisting the Applicant's claim, is the sign it then identifies, namely "" BAREFOOT RADLER "". 33 Had the Amended Defence simply denied the infringement being alleged, Lion Nathan may well have been able to advance submissions that the sign to be used was a combination of the words and the image. But the fact is that the Amended Defence goes on to expressly identify the sign which it says is not substantially identical with or deceptively similar to that being relied upon by Gallo Winery , and it identifies that sign as being "" BAREFOOT RADLER "". At the very least, that express statement in the Amended Defence is productive of such uncertainty that it was thereafter incumbent upon Lion Nathan to identify in its Amended Defence the sign upon which reliance was to be placed -- if that sign was to be anything other than the combination of words. Without that further express clarification, a contention that the "" sign "" is the words and the image would be a contention that would "" take the other party by surprise "" within the meaning of O 11, r 10. 36 But for its pleadings, there was otherwise no reason not to conclude that the "" sign "" Lion Nathan was in fact the following, incorporating both a combination of the words and the image: Such is what appears on the cardboard packaging for its "" six pack ""; such is what appears on the individual bottles of beer and in its advertisements for its beer. And each of the elements of that "" sign "" has a degree of prominence. Prominence is attracted to the image of the bare foot and the word "" BAREFOOT "" by reason of their being printed in white; prominence is also equally attracted to the word "" RADLER "" by reason of it being printed in green. The words and the image of the bare foot are given additional prominence by all being set against a blue background encircled by a roughly drawn white circumference. The word "" BAREFOOT "" is also given additional prominence by that word dissecting the image of the bare foot. 37 Given the constraint imposed by the pleadings, however, there is similarly no reason not to conclude that the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan is the combination of the words "" BAREFOOT RADLER "" alone. This was the sign identified in the Amended Defence. Even without the image of the bare foot, the prominence and distinctiveness of those words remains sufficiently discrete as to be the "" sign "" used. 38 What is the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan , it is accepted by both parties, is a question of fact. 39 The second of the questions posed requires resolution of whether the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan is "" substantially identical with "" the trade mark of Gallo Winery. 40 There is no dispute between the parties as to the meaning of the phrase "" substantially identical "" as used in s 120(1) -- the dispute is as to the manner in which that phrase is to be applied to the facts. 41 There is no definition in the 1995 Act of the phrase "" substantially identical "". 44 A "" side by side "" comparison of the trade mark of Gallo Winery and the "" sign "" as used by Lion Nathan -- as confined by its pleadings -- discloses, it is considered, no substantial identity . The two marks are certainly not "" identical "". The two marks have in common the word "" BAREFOOT "". But the "" sign "" as used by Lion Nathan also employs the additional word "" RADLER "". The question is thus whether there is a substantial identity. Section 120(2), it will be noted, does not require that the two marks be "" identical ""; s 120(2) is infringed if the mark of Lion Nathan is "" substantially identical with "" that of Gallo Winery . 45 In reaching the conclusion that the marks are not substantially identical, it has been recognised that the word "" BAREFOOT "" is both an ordinary English word and a word which has been used in a variety of contexts advertising many different types of goods. An internet search undertaken by a law graduate employed by the solicitors for Lion Nathan (Mr Campbell) disclosed the word "" BAREFOOT "" being used in the promotion of a beach-side resort; a water-skiing club; a sailing cruise; a coffee roaster; weddings; horse saddles; furniture; and vacations. Other instances were also exposed. Not surprisingly, many of these products had some association with the beach or water. 46 It is a word, however, common to both marks and a word which is strongly associated with a carefree lifestyle. 47 But it is the addition of the word "" RADLER "" which denies any substantial identity as between the trade mark of Gallo Winery and the "" sign "" as used by Lion Nathan . Rejected is a submission advanced by Gallo Winery that the word "" RADLER "" is but a description of a particular type of beer and that it is the word "" BAREFOOT "" alone which distinguishes its beer from that of others. It is the combination of the words which distinguishes the Lion Nathan beer -- an essential and prominent feature of the sign as used by Lion Nathan is thus not only the word "" BAREFOOT"" but also the word "" RADLER "". Lion Nathan's use of the word "" RADLER "" is an important and integral part of the sign it uses and is an obvious source of distinction. 48 Of limited assistance in confirming such a conclusion is the following exchange between the Deputy Chairman of McWilliams Wines (Mr Kevin McLintock) and his cross-examiner: But your reaction at the time when you saw the product was that the name of the product was Barefoot Radler capital B, capital R, wasn't it? --- Correct. ... ... because you think that the name of this product is Barefoot Radler don't you? --- Yes. 49 Had Lion Nathan not been confined by its pleadings and had it been free to also include as part of its sign the image of the bare foot, any finding of fact that there was substantial identity would have been more easily denied. The differences would be such that -- and the total impression would be such that -- any similarity as would have been occasioned by the word "" BAREFOOT "" alone would be of little significance. The similarity, of course, would remain the single word "" BAREFOOT "". But the differences would be even more significant if the prominent image of the bare foot were able to be included. 50 Section 120(1) is expressed in the alternative and requires a consideration of whether the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan is "" substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to "" the trade mark of Gallo Winery . 51 Again, there is no dispute between the parties as to the meaning to be given to the phrase "" deceptively similar "" -- the dispute is as to the manner in which that phrase is to be applied to the facts. 52 A trade mark is taken to be "" deceptively similar to "" another trade mark if it so nearly resembles that other trade mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion: s 10. 57 The impression based on a recollection of the "" sign "" as used by Lion Nathan and a recollection of Gallo Winery's trade mark, it is considered, would lead to a likelihood of deception or confusion. 197 In applying the terms of the discretion previously conferred by s 23(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1955 (Cth), Foster J observed that it was a discretion only to be exercised in "" exceptional circumstances "": Jonathan Ross Sceats v Jonathan Sceats Design Pty Ltd (1990) 17 IPR 28. Foster J there observed at 29 30: The section to which I have just made reference has been the subject of consideration by courts of high authority. It is quite clear that the word ""may"", used in the section, requires that a court, in determining whether relief should be granted, exercise a discretion. Accordingly, a court in considering the matters raised by s 23 may, even though it be satisfied that the desiderata of the section have been made out, nevertheless refrain from ordering the removal of the trade mark in the manner contemplated by the section. The question of the operation of this discretion is considered in Shanahan's Australian Trade Mark Law and Practice, 1982 ed, p 212, under the heading, ""Discretion under s 23(1)"". The learned author refers to the decision of Kitto J in Carl Zeiss Pty Ltd's Application [1969] HCA 17 ; (1969) 122 CLR 1 , which clearly establishes the existence of the residual discretion in the court, to which I have made reference. It is also clear, as the learned author points out, that the discretion is one of general application and not restricted specifically to sections of the Act. However, he also goes on to say: ""It has been said that the discretion should be exercised only in 'exceptional circumstances'; however, there may well be cases where the public interest requires that the registration be retained."" Reference is made to the case of J Lyons &amp; Co Ltd's Application [1959] RPC 120 at 130. I consider that the law is quite clear in this regard: although the discretion not to make an order of removal exists even though the enabling circumstances required by the section are proved, the discretion to refuse such an order is only to be exercised in the exceptional circumstances referred to."
Case1420,followed,"Kowa Co Ltd v Organon [2005] FCA 1282 , 223 ALR 27","The discretion presently conferred by s 101(3) of the 1995 Act, it has been said, confers a "" broad discretion "": C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [72] , [2000] FCA 1539 ; 52 IPR 42 at 73. And it is a discretion, it is considered, no longer constrained by any requirement to establish "" exceptional circumstances ""; it is a discretion which may be exercised "" when it is reasonable to do so "": Kowa Co Ltd v Organon [2005] FCA 1282 , 223 ALR 27. Lander J there indicated that he was of the view that it was not reasonable not to remove the mark in issue. Of the discretion, his Honour concluded: [97] ... There are significant differences in the section considered by the Court of Appeal in Lyons [(1959) 76 RPC 120] and s 101(3). In the English section, regard had to be had to the bona fide use of the trade mark during the relevant period. No such regard is had in s 101(3). It is always dangerous to have regard to a statement of principle in relation to the exercise of a discretion in a section in an Act which is not in pari materia with a section of a second Act for the purpose of considering the way in which a discretion should be exercised in that second Act. [98] In Upjohn [(1998) 42 IPR 576] it was said that the power may be applied in ""exceptional circumstances"". Section 101(3) does not say that. There is no warrant to read the expression ""exceptional circumstances"" into the subsection. That would be to give the subsection a construction contrary to its express terms. In my opinion, the discretion which is to be exercised under s 101(3) is to be exercised as the subsection itself says, ""when it is reasonable to do so"". To suggest that the party against whom the non-use has been put in a case such as this should establish exceptional circumstances is to put too high a hurdle in that party's path. 210 Although the "" guiding principle behind the discretion is public interest, particularly in the integrity of the register "" ( Kowa Co Ltd v Organon [2005] FCA 1282 at [92] , [2005] FCA 1282 ; 223 ALR 27 at 41 2 per Lander J), the private commercial interests of both Gallo Winery and Lion Nathan remain matters which may be taken into account when exercising the discretion. Trade mark law, it has been recognised, is more complex than is suggested by the proposition that the supreme -- or, at least -- a predominant interest is the maintenance of the integrity of the Register: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 at [40] , [2000] HCA 12 ; 202 CLR 45 at 65. Speaking of the 1955 Act, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ there pointed out the balance struck by the legislation between various interests. Both the interests of the consuming public and the interests of traders have to be recognised. Their Honours observed that: [42] ... the Australian legislation has manifested from time to time a varying accommodation of commercial and the consuming public's interests. There is the interest of consumers in recognising a trade mark as a badge of origin of goods or services and in avoiding deception or confusion as to that origin. There is the interest of traders, both in protecting their goodwill through the creation of a statutory species of property protected by the action against infringement, and in turning this property to valuable account by licensing or assignment. The provisions of the 1955 Act with respect to defensive registrations and certification marks were recognitions that the interests of the owners of registered trade marks may go beyond that of indicating trade origin. In Yale Electric Corporation v Robertson [(1928) 26 F 2d 972 at 973], Judge Learned Hand said of this interest: ""that one merchant shall not divert customers from another by representing what he sells as emanating from the second.

Case1422,distinguished,Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414,"The reference to Moorgate is a reference to Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414. Gummow J referred to that decision as setting forth the "" applicable principles "" and set forth (at IPR 518 19) the following passages from the judgment of Deane J (at CLR 433 4): To establish prior use of the mark in Australia, Moorgate relies upon evidence that, during or in connexion with discussions between Loew's and Philip Morris about the introduction of the low tar and nicotine cigarette in Australia, packets of cigarettes and associated advertising material displaying the name ""KENT GOLDEN LIGHTS"" were handed personally, or in one instance sent by mail, to representatives of Philip Morris in Australia. That evidence indicates that there were at least three occasions on which such cigarette packets and advertising material were so delivered. At the times when those items were so delivered, there was no intention on the part of Loew's that it would itself trade in the goods in Australia. Nor, for that matter, had it been decided what name would be used if Philip Morris were, under licence from Loew's, to commence to manufacture and market the goods in Australia at some indefinite future time. ... In the present case, there was not, at any relevant time, any actual trade or offer to trade in goods bearing the mark in Australia or any existing intention to offer or supply such goods in trade. There was no local use of the mark as a trade mark at all; there were merely preliminary discussions and negotiations about whether the mark would be so used. The cigarette packets and associated advertising material were delivered to Philip Morris to demonstrate what Loew's was marketing in other countries and what Philip Morris might market, under licence from Loew's, if it decided to manufacture and trade in the goods in Australia and to use the mark locally at some future time. There was no relevant trade in the goods in Australia and the delivery of the cigarette packets and associated material to Philip Morris did not, in the circumstances, constitute a relevant user or use in Australia of the mark ""KENT GOLDEN LIGHTS"" for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connexion in the course of trade between the new cigarettes and Loew's. 169 Moorgate Tobacco is not authority for the proposition that an intention alone to use a trade mark constitutes a use sufficient to defeat an application for removal for non-use. 170 Gallo Winery further contends that, in the event that there was a non-use of the trade mark, there was an "" obstacle "" to its use. This obstacle was the fact that Logan Wines Pty Ltd ( Logan Wines ) had a registered trade mark which it considered was remarkably similar to the BAREFOOT design which Gallo Winery had acquired from Barefoot Cellars . 171 The trade mark of Logan Wines had been registered in April 2004 and was as follows: The trade mark of Gallo Winery was of course the word BAREFOOT , but not the image of the bare foot as depicted in the mark of Logan Wines ."

In its commercial judgment, the development of the Australian market was deliberately left until the end of 2007. It could have used its mark during the non-use period.

And, as was the like assessment of Gummow J in that decision, some reliance may also be placed upon the initial reaction of the Consumer Insight Manager for Lion Nathan (Mr Simpson) when he first learned of the trade mark registration of the word "" BAREFOOT "" for wines -- he "" was not overly concerned about the wine mark as beer was the main category that the project team was initially focusing on "". 88 It is thus considered that the Lion Nathan BAREFOOT RADLER beers are not "" goods of the same description "" as wine. 89 The concluding words of s 120(2) of the 1995 Act further provide a "" defence "" as follows: However, the person is not taken to have infringed the trade mark if the person establishes that using the sign as the person did is not likely to deceive or cause confusion.

One aspect of the "" public interest "" is thus the public interest in the integrity of the Register: NSW Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd (1989) 14 IPR 75 at 79 per Gummow J. 209 Justice Woodward in Paragon Shoes was by no means attempting to set forth an exhaustive statement as to the content of the "" public interest "" when considering the discretion to permit a mark to remain registered. Centrally relevant to that discretion must remain a consideration of whether the public would be deceived or confused. Considerations such as those deposed to by Mr Simpson, and in particular the costs incurred in promoting a product, however, assume some limited relevance and assist the conclusion -- otherwise reached -- that the discretion should be exercised adversely to Gallo Winery .

Case1428,followed,Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670,"The use of a trade mark is an authorised use only to the extent that the user uses the trade mark "" under the control of the owner of the trade mark "": s 8(2). The essential requirement is that there must be a connection in the course of trade with the registered proprietor: Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670. Aickin J there observed (at 683): These cases demonstrate that the essential requirement for the maintenance of the validity of a trade mark is that it must indicate a connexion in the course of trade with the registered proprietor, even though the connexion may be slight, such as selection or quality control or control of the user in the sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary. Use by either the registered proprietor or a licensee (whether registered or otherwise) will protect the mark from attack on the ground of non-user, but it is essential both that the user maintains the connexion of the registered proprietor with the goods and that the use of the mark does not become otherwise deceptive. Conversely registration of a registered user will not save the mark if there ceases to be the relevant connexion in the course of trade with the proprietor or the mark otherwise becomes deceptive. 148 This conclusion is consistent with the interpretation of Estex Clothing provided by Aickin J in Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670. His Honour there referred to Estex Clothing and continued (at 688): It was argued that Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty. Ltd. v. Ellis and Goldstein Ltd. decided that a retailer who sold imported goods bearing an Australian registered trade mark did not use the mark, and that therefore a ""distributor"" did not use a mark which was already on the goods. In my opinion the Estex Case is not authority for that proposition. It is authority for the proposition that the foreign owner of an Australian mark uses it in Australia when he sells goods for delivery abroad to Australian retailers and those retailers import them into Australia for sale and there sell them. It demonstrates that such a situation does not differ from that where he sells the goods for delivery in Australia to the retailer or where he advertises the goods in Australia. ..."
Case1429,distinguished,Polo Textile Industries Pty Ltd v Domestic Textile Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 203 ; (1993) 42 FCR 227,"In reaching this conclusion considerable assistance has been gained from the decision of Burchett J in Polo Textile Industries Pty Ltd v Domestic Textile Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 203 ; (1993) 42 FCR 227. Polo Textile was there the registered proprietor of the mark "" Polo "" in respect of manchester, including sheets and towels. It was concluded that Domestic Textile did not avoid infringing that mark by selling bed linen products using the mark "" Polo Club "". Burchett J concluded that it was of importance that the distinctive impact of the word "" Polo "" was likely to affect the mind while the presence or absence of the blander word "" Club "" may escape notice. See also: de Cordova v Vick Chemical Co (1951) 68 RPC 103. 61 A distinction may be drawn as between the present case and that in Polo Textile -- but that distinction does not lead to any different conclusion. Unlike the use of a bland word such as "" Club "" -- as in the Polo Textile decision -- the word "" RADLER "" adds an additional and important distinguishing feature to the product. The word "" RADLER "" is not an ordinary English word and its use, it is considered, adds an element of both distinction and curiosity, such that persons will query what that particular word means."

In allowing an appeal from a decision refusing to register a trade mark, Wilcox J concluded (at 624): The questions whether one mark is deceptively similar to another and whether the first mark is used in respect of services closely related to particular goods (or similar to other particular services) are conceptually distinct. However, the first question cannot be addressed in isolation from the second. The closer the relationship between the services and particular goods, the more likely any similarity in marks will prove deceptive. The examples offered by Lockhart J in Caterpillar Loader Hire make the point. There are extremely close associations between the sale of data processing equipment and the provision of programs for its operation, the sale and sewing of curtains and the sale and tailoring of clothes. Because the relevant service is so specialised, and focused on the particular goods, it would be natural for any member of the public to treat a similarity of name as being an indication of a link between the origin of the goods and that of the service. At the other extreme, the use of even the same name, by traders in different industries, would not usually cause members of the public to assume a link between the traders.

Use ""as a trade mark"" in s 120(1) is use of the mark as a ""badge of origin"" in the sense that it indicates a connection in the course of trade between goods and the person who applies the mark to the goods: Coca Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 at [19] , [1999] FCA 1721 ; 96 FCR 107 at 115 per Black CJ, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ; Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 at [45] per Sundberg J.

Windeyer J there observed: In considering whether marks are substantially identical they should, I think, be compared side by side, their similarities and differences noted and the importance of these assessed having regard to the essential features of the registered mark and the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from the comparison. ""The identification of an essential feature depends"", it has been said, ""partly on the Court's own judgment and partly on the burden of the evidence that is placed before it"": de Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co. [(1951) 68 RPC 103 at] [2], at p. 106. Whether there is substantial identity is a question of fact... In order to determine whether marks are "" substantially identical "", they should thus be compared side by side with their similarities and differences noted: Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 at [38] , [1999] FCA 1721 ; 96 FCR 107 at 121.

Case1437,followed,Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592,"It is considered that the impression which would be left on the mind of a person of ordinary intelligence would be that there was a deceptive similarity as between the mark used by Gallo Winery and that used by Lion Nathan and as pleaded in its Amended Defence . The similarity is such that persons would wonder whether the products came from the same source; an actual probability of deception need not be established: Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592. Kitto J was there dealing with an application for registration of a trade mark and the statutory phrase "" likely to deceive "" and observed (at 595): ... It is not necessary, in order to find that a trade mark offends against the section, to prove that there is an actual probability of deception leading to a passing-off. While a mere possibility of confusion is not enough--for there must be a real, tangible danger of its occurring ... --it is sufficient if the result of the user of the mark will be that a number of persons will be caused to wonder whether it might not be the case that the two products come from the same source. It is enough if the ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt. ... No intention to deceive or cause confusion is required and there is no element of culpability to be inferred from the word "" deceive "": Coca Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 at [39] , [1999] FCA 1721 ; 96 FCR 107 at 122 per Black CJ, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ. 68 In resolving this question, the fact that goods serve different purposes is not conclusive; nor is any one particular consideration conclusive. Assistance, however, has been provided as to those matters which may be taken into account: Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592. Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Webb, Fullagar and Taylor JJ there, at 606 7, gave content to the task to be undertaken as follows: The fact that examination of the nature of the applicant's goods may, by itself, induce an observer to conclude that they are different in character from those of an opponent, and designed to serve different purposes, is by no means conclusive. Nor is the fact that the applicant's goods are not specified by the regulations as being within the same class of goods... There may be many matters to be considered apart from the inherent character of the goods in respect of which the application is made and some indication of what matters are relevant to this inquiry was given by Romer J. in In re Jellinek's Application [(1946) 63 RPC 59]. Romer J. thought it necessary to look beyond the nature of the goods in question and to compare not only their respective uses but also to examine the trade channels through which the commodities in question were bought and sold. Shortly after the decision in Jellinek's Case the Assistant-Comptroller elaborated on the observations of Romer J. in the following manner: ""In arriving at a decision upon this issue the reported cases show that I have to take account of a number of factors, including in particular the nature and characteristics of the goods, their origin, their purpose, whether they are usually produced by one and the same manufacturer or distributed by the same wholesale houses, whether they are sold in the same shops over the same counters during the same seasons and to the same class or classes of customers, and whether by those engaged in their manufacture and distribution they are regarded as belonging to the same trade. In the case of Jellinek's Application [(1946) 63 RPC 59] , Romer J. classified these various factors under three heads, viz., the nature of the goods, the uses thereof, and the trade channels through which they are bought and sold. No single consideration is conclusive in itself, and it has further been emphasized that the classifications contained in the schedules to the Trade Marks Rules are not a decisive criterion as to whether or not two sets of goods are 'of the same description'"": In re an Application by John Crowther &amp; Sons (Milnsbridge) Ltd. [(1948) 65 RPC 369 at 372]. Much the same considerations are evident in the observation of Dixon J. (as he then was) in Reckitt &amp; Colman (Australia) Ltd. v. Boden [1945] HCA 12 ; [(1945) 70 CLR 84 at 94] when he said: ""What forms the same description of goods must be discovered from a consideration of the course of trade or business. One factor is the use to which the two sets of goods are put. Another is whether they are commonly dealt with in the same course of trade or business. In the present case, the goods are quite different, their uses are widely separated and they are not commonly sold in the same kinds of shops or departments""."
Case1438,followed,Tavener Rutledge Ltd v Specters Ltd [1959] RPC 355,"Reference may also be made to Tavener Rutledge Ltd v Specters Ltd [1959] RPC 355. Lord Evershed MR there referred to the prospect of a plaintiff being able to establish the mark of a defendant causing confusion. His Lordship continued at 359 60: ... If the plaintiffs establish that then, as I have said, the defendants may still have another line of defence and may say, ""Though it may generally be as you say a mark likely to cause confusion, in fact the way I have used it and in the circumstances and environment in which I have used it, it is not likely to cause confusion.""

Case1439,followed,Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss &amp; Co (1994) 49 FCR 89,"The comparison, it should be noted, is different to that undertaken in a passing off action where the plaintiff points to the goodwill built up around a mark by reason of prior use and then points to the conduct of the defendant as leading to deception, or perhaps merely confusion, and the consequent damage to that goodwill of the plaintiff: Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss &amp; Co (1994) 49 FCR 89 at 128 9 per Gummow J. Essentially what is required when considering whether a mark is deceptively similar to another is a comparison between the mark of the registered owner and that of the alleged infringer: C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [44] , [2000] FCA 1539 ; 52 IPR 42 at 62.

Case1440,followed,"Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 , 107 FCR 166","To fall within s 100(3)(c) it is not sufficient for the owner of a trade mark to point to circumstances peculiar to himself. There must be some circumstance which in a practical business sense caused the non-use of the mark: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 , 107 FCR 166. Drummond J there summarised the approach to be adopted as follows: [46] It can be accepted that the wording of s 100(3)(c) was deliberately adopted to give the subsection a wider operation than the narrowly worded provision contained in s 23(4) of the 1955 Act. It is now not necessary to show unusual or abnormal, as opposed to normal or usual, trading conditions (a difficult concept to comprehend and apply) before s 100(3)(c) can operate. Ordinary incidents of the trade cycle commonly encountered by traders, as well as abnormal ones, are now within the provision. Further, it is clear that a circumstance of a trading nature that has an impact only on the registered owner can also now be relied on to justify non-use of the mark. [47] In the context of s 100(3)(c), there are, however, good grounds for reading ""circumstances"" as not embracing any event of any kind. The circumstances must be ""an obstacle to the use of the trade mark by the registered owner"". This suggests that they must arise from or comprise events external to the registered owner in the sense of not having been brought about by the voluntary act of the owner. [48] But if any circumstance external to the owner, in the sense of being a circumstance not brought about by the voluntary act of the owner, is within the provision, the Court would be drawn into inquiries of a kind that it is difficult to accept were in the contemplation of the Parliament. Financial impecuniosity could excuse non-use of a trade mark, irrespective of how enduring and intractable the owner's impecuniosity might be. Illness of the registered owner could also excuse non-use of the registered trade mark (as is the contention of the applicants here). A falling out between joint registered owners of a mark that disrupts the use by either of the mark might also be capable of excusing non-use. In all such situations, questions could arise requiring investigation by the Court into whether the obstructing circumstances were due to the conduct of the registered owner. [49] If the Parliament intended any circumstance external to the owner to be capable of providing an excuse for non-use, little purpose would be served by the words in parenthesis in s 100(3)(c), namely, ""whether affecting traders generally or only the registered owner of the trade mark"". The presence of these words is some indication that the circumstances comprising an obstacle to use of the mark must not only arise externally to the registered owner, but must also be circumstances of a trading nature. His Honour considered that s 100(3)(c) was "" sufficiently obscure "" to occasion recourse to extrinsic material, including the Second Reading Speech . His Honour continued: [54] It is apparent from these extrinsic materials that s 100(3)(c) was not intended by the Parliament to provide a defence to an attack on a registered trade mark for non-use on any grounds, including grounds entirely personal to the trade mark owner that do not bear any trading character, so long only as they do not arise from the voluntary actions of the owner. [55] In my opinion, circumstances within s 100(3)(c) will only exist when events arise that are capable of disrupting trade in the area of commercial activity in which goods bearing the registered owner's mark are traded. For the statutory excuse to be made out, those circumstances must cause (in a practical business sense) non-use of the particular mark by the owner, whether or not they have an impact on any persons other than the owner of that mark who are also involved in that same area of commercial activity. There must be a causal link shown between the relevant circumstances and the mark's non-use. This requirement arises from the fact that s 100(3)(c) creates an excuse only where the mark has not been used by the registered owner ""because of"" circumstances etc. It will not assist the opponent to removal to show the existence of an impediment to use of the kind referred to in s 100(3)(c) if he does not also establish that, but for that impediment, he would have used the mark. Compare Re James Crean &amp; Son Ltd's Trade Mark [(1921) 38 RPC 155] at 162. [56] Circumstances that do not have a trade character but which only affect a mark owner in his personal character, such as illness afflicting the owner of the mark that is sufficiently disabling to prevent the owner using the mark, can never therefore found an answer within s 100(3)(c) to an application for removal of the mark for non-use. 167 In the present proceedings there were undoubtedly discussions between Gallo Winery and McWilliams Wines as to the launch in Australia of BAREFOOT wine. But by May 2007 the negotiations had not proceeded beyond just that, negotiations. Compare: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 at [40] , [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 at 179. There was unquestionably an intention to launch BAREFOOT wine in Australia "" in around September 2007 "". But, and unlike the position in Buying Systems , there had been no step taken during the non-use period comparable to the placing of advertisements or the printing of letterheads or business cards. The only step which had been taken was the unilateral step taken by McWilliams Wines to allocate some of its wine. Gallo Winery was pleased that such a step had been taken as it preserved the possibility of a launch in September 2007. That was a step taken, however, by McWilliams Wines and not by Gallo Winery. 168 Gallo Winery , it is considered, had only engaged in preliminary or preparatory acts: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 at [28] , [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 at 175 per Drummond J. See also: Burrell R, The Requirement of Trade Mark Use: Recent Developments in Australia (2005) 16 AIPJ 231 at 238. 189 A single use during the non-use period, it should be accepted, is sufficient: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 at [14] [17], [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 at 171 2 per Drummond J. 190 And "" good faith "" means a real as opposed to a token use in a commercial sense. It requires a "" substantial and genuine "" use: NSW Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd (No 1) (1989) 14 IPR 26 at 45. Gummow J concluded: In these circumstances, it is clear that in the three year period ending 6 June 1988 (being the period specified in s 23(1)(b)) the moo mark had been used by the registered proprietor not only in relation to cheese, but also in relation to flavoured milk in the sense required to preserve the registration, subject only to the further requirement that the use answered the description of having been bona fide. In ""Concord"" Trade Mark [1987] FSR 209 ; Falconer J held that to be bona fide within the meaning of the equivalent provision in the British legislation (s 26 of the 1938 Act) use should be substantial and genuine judged by ordinary commercial standards considered in relation to the trade concerned. ... I should add that use by the first respondent would not cease to be bona fide even if the evidence had been that it used the trade mark only after it appreciated that the registration was vulnerable to an attack on the ground of non-use by reason of the lack of activity of the second respondent; nor would it cease to be bona fide, even though, as is the case on the evidence, neither the officers of the first respondent nor its patent attorney, who dealt with the second respondent at the time the assignment was taken in 1987, had enquired closely of the second respondent as to the extent of its previous user of the trade mark... Aff'd: NSW Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd [1990] HCA 60 ; (1990) 171 CLR 363. This approach was endorsed by Drummond J in Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 at [16] , [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 at 171."
Case1441,followed,Woolworths Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks (1998) 42 IPR 615,"In support of the submission that reliance may be placed upon not only the sign being used by Lion Nathan but also upon a wider ranger of considerations, including the manner in which that sign is being used and the differences between the competing products, reference was made to Woolworths Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks (1998) 42 IPR 615. In allowing an appeal from a decision refusing to register a trade mark, Wilcox J concluded (at 624): The questions whether one mark is deceptively similar to another and whether the first mark is used in respect of services closely related to particular goods (or similar to other particular services) are conceptually distinct. However, the first question cannot be addressed in isolation from the second. The closer the relationship between the services and particular goods, the more likely any similarity in marks will prove deceptive. The examples offered by Lockhart J in Caterpillar Loader Hire make the point. There are extremely close associations between the sale of data processing equipment and the provision of programs for its operation, the sale and sewing of curtains and the sale and tailoring of clothes. Because the relevant service is so specialised, and focused on the particular goods, it would be natural for any member of the public to treat a similarity of name as being an indication of a link between the origin of the goods and that of the service. At the other extreme, the use of even the same name, by traders in different industries, would not usually cause members of the public to assume a link between the traders. On appeal, the decision of Wilcox J was upheld: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCA 1020 , 93 FCR 365."

Case1443,considered,Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225,"general nature of the conduct which is alleged by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Authority) to constitute contraventions of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (Spam Act), together with pertinent principles in relation to the imposition of penalty are canvassed at some length in reasons for judgment which I delivered on 23 October 2009 in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225 (ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4)). These reasons for the judgment should also then, in respect of those two subjects, be read in conjunction with that earlier (ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4)) judgment in this matter. Some repetition is necessary as to the general background, if only to provide a context against which the particular involvement of Jobspy and Mr Moles falls for assessment of penalty. The essence of the contraventions of s 16 of the Spam Act , which are established by the default judgment, is a contravention, and a repeated contravention, by the sending of unsolicited short message service (SMS) messages to the mobile telephones of users who have been deceived, inveigled even, into providing their mobile telephone numbers to representatives of either Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (Mobilegate), or, as the case may be, Winning Bid Pty Ltd (Winning Bid), under the belief that they were corresponding with individuals seeking to meet them and form relationships via dating websites. It was the very essence of the businesses of Mobilegate and Winning Bid to engage in this conduct. That conduct is a form of seduction for reward of those who are vulnerable. It is a particularly vile form of conduct. Moreover, it is a form of conduct which, when the deception is appreciated by its victim, wounds in a peculiarly embarrassing and emotional way, quite aside from its financial impact. Those non-financial aspects of victim impact are such that the perpetrator of the contravention is to some extent rendered immune, or at least afforded a degree of immunity, from a likelihood of complaint, in my opinion. That is a feature, in my opinion, which is not unknown in respect of criminal activity, and I interpolate at once this is not criminal activity, but contraventions of civil penalties, which touches upon a person's sexual nature. In other words, an embarrassment attends the victim of the contravention and that embarrassment in turn provides the degree of immunity from complaint. I regard that as an aggravating aspect of the contravening conduct."
Case1444,considered,Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377,"factor which I took into account in the ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4) judgment is that articulated by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 (Clarity1) at para 43. By reference to other authorities, his Honour observed that, while he accepted that the issue of capacity to pay is a relevant factor, it is one ""of less importance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty that satisfies the objective of general deterrence"". Deterrence is a factor of particular importance in this case. I have already adverted to the need for penalties to demonstrate that both in the specific and general senses. Whilst the Act does provide for large penalties, it nonetheless makes provision for a daily maximum, something of a cap in other words. Nicholson J drew attention to this feature of the legislation in Clarity 1 by reference to the explanatory memorandum to the bill which became the Spam Act . It is there stated: A daily ceiling for penalties has been set and may be charged for all contraventions against a particular provision that have occurred in one day. This has been included to ensure that a meaningful penalty may be charged for a single contravention without causing an unrealistically large penalty payable for multiple contraventions. For example, there are reported cases of dedicated spammers sending millions of unsolicited commercial and electronic messages each day. Without a ceiling amount for daily contraventions such a spammer could potentially be liable for a million contraventions. Jobspy and its director, Mr Moles, were involved in contravening conduct the subject of default judgment for a period in excess of 800 days. Using the maximum penalties under the Spam Act as a guide for calculation that yields, in the case of Mr Moles, a total potential penalty of over $35 million, and in the case of Jobspy over $100 million."

Veda relies on Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [83] ff. In my view the criticism is well made.

Paragraph 18 (common to all three proceedings) pleads a case alternative to publication to the minds of officers of the subscribing credit providers. It commences: 18. To the extent, if at all (which is not admitted), that the Court found that, notwithstanding the publication of the information in paragraph 16 above, the said information was not read in its entirety by an individual on behalf of the subscribers of the Respondent to whom such information was published, but was interpreted or assessed, wholly or in part, by a computer, which computer recommended that any application for credit be declined, the latter information and/or recommendation was nevertheless published by the Respondent (via computer) to the said subscriber or subscribers of the Respondent, and the said publication was read and comprehended by the said subscribers (by one or more natural persons who were servants or agents of each such subscriber) and conveyed the following imputations ... 39 On 31 July 2007, Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth, solicitors for Veda, wrote to Gerard Malouf &amp; Partners, solicitors for the applicants, asking them to specify the facts, matters and circumstances relied on in support of the allegation that Veda ""nevertheless published"" the information and/or recommendation.

Case1451,cited,WG &amp; B Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Tesla Farad Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1776,"It is convenient to deal first with Apache's jurisdictional objection. It is not in dispute that, in the absence of the claims which are founded on the TPA, Newcrest could not pursue a case based on allegations of breach of contract in this Court. Nor is it in dispute that the Court will lack jurisdiction to deal with a controversy in circumstances in which the only federal claims relied are either colourable (in the sense of not being bona fide but rather relied on solely to attract the Court's jurisdiction) or trivial or insubstantial. In WG &amp; B Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Tesla Farad Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1776 Finkelstein J stated the relevant principles (at [11] to [14]) as follows: ""[11] This then requires me to determine whether the non-federal claims are justiciable in the Federal Court. The relevant cases show that if a federal claim which is said to enliven the accrued jurisdiction of the court to dispose of non-federal claims is trivial or unsubstantial, that will not be sufficient to attract that jurisdiction. The cases are collected in the judgment of Merkel J in Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 165. As Merkel J pointed out, triviality in this context does not require an examination as to whether the federal claim is less likely to succeed than the non-federal claim. Accrued jurisdiction does not depend upon an assessment being made of the strengths of the federal claim; rather the question is whether the federal claim is genuine. If the federal claim is colourable in the sense that it was made for the purpose of fabricating jurisdiction, of course the jurisdiction of the court is not enlivened: see Fitzroy Motors Pty Ltd v Hyundai Automotive Distributors Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 133 ALR 445. How is the genuineness of the claim to be determined? One way is to ask whether the federal claim is bound to fail, that is to say, to ask whether the claim is unarguable. If the federal claim is hopeless then it is difficult to see how an applicant could contend that it was pursuing the claim bona fide. [12] However, it is not only when a federal claim is colourable that the Federal Court would lack jurisdiction to deal with non-federal matters. In Fencott v Muller (at 609-610) in a joint judgment of Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ, the following was said: ""However, federal judicial power is attracted to the whole of a controversy only if the federal claim is a substantial aspect of that controversy. A federal claim which is a trivial or insubstantial aspect of the controversy must, of course, itself be resolved in federal jurisdiction, but it would be neither appropriate nor convenient in such a case to translate to federal jurisdiction the determination of the substantial aspects of the controversy from the jurisdiction to which they are subject in order to determine the trivial or insubstantial federal aspect. Again, impression and practical judgment must determine whether it is appropriate and convenient that the whole controversy be determined by the exercise of federal judicial power."" [13] In the present case, on balance I am not prepared to conclude that the asserted federal claims are not genuine in the sense that they are colourable and only brought for the purpose of fabricating jurisdiction, but what does seem plain to me is that the cause of action under s52 of the Trade Practices Act is ""trivial or insubstantial"" in the sense explained by the High Court in Fencott v Muller. This is not a claim that would be appropriately and conveniently determined in the exercise of federal jurisdiction. [14] In the result two things follow. First, the court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the non-federal claims. Second, there being no other claims that are relied upon to found jurisdiction in the Federal Court, the proceeding must be dismissed with costs."" 19 Newcrest alleges that the respondents expressed opinions and made forecasts without having reasonable grounds to do so. It relies on ss 51A and 52 of the TPA. The particular opinions and forecasts are said to be found in the following documents: &#8226; The late June 2008 press release; &#8226; The 30 July 2008 letter from Apache; and &#8226; The 2 August 2008 letter from Santos. 20 It is said that those documents contain representations that, by mid-August, the respondents would be supplying Newcrest with its full gas entitlement under the contract. Newcrest says that, acting on these representations, it cancelled some temporary arrangements and then was forced to make further alternative arrangements when, in mid-August, full supply had not been restored. This led to Newcrest incurring substantial losses."

He deposes that Newcrest believes that it has or may have a right to obtain relief against the respondents on the basis that it believes that the respondents have breached a contractual obligation to provide Newcrest with its fair pro-rated share of gas produced from the Brookes field and that the respondents have made statements which may constitute misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TPA and/or s 10 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA). He says that the attempts made by Newcrest to obtain relevant information have proved fruitless and that he believes that the respondents have or are likely to have relevant documents in their possession. 34 For reasons already given in dealing with Apache's argument relating to jurisdiction, I consider that there is reasonable cause to believe that Newcrest may have a right to obtain relief under the TPA. The evidence suggests that each element of a cause of action under s 52 of the TPA may be present. Moreover, Apache did not seriously contest Newcrest's contention that it had, in addition, a viable cause of action for breach of its supply contract with Apache."

Case1459,cited,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"The second ground relied upon by the applicant is that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in applying s 91R(1)(a) of the Act. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal found that the essential and significant motivation for the harm feared by the applicant was that criminals wanted to take control of his family's assets. According to the applicant, the Tribunal arrived at this conclusion erroneously by considering the 'primary motivating factor' in the actions taken by the criminals. In substance, the applicant's argument is that the expression 'primary motivating factor' departed from the language of the Act and led the Tribunal to address the wrong question, giving rise to a jurisdictional error: cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259. 24 The Tribunal's reasons for decision ought not to be read in an over-technical or pedantic way. They must be read fairly and in context. The expression 'primary motivating factor' was used by the Tribunal on one occasion. Elsewhere in its reasons, both before and afterwards, the Tribunal used the phrase 'the essential and significant reason' or 'the essential and significant motivation'. These expressions correctly reflect the test that is required in relation to s 91R(1)(a). I agree with the submission made on behalf of the first respondent that when the various passages in the Tribunal's reasons are considered together and in context, it becomes clear that the Tribunal applied the correct test. In my opinion, there was no error in the Tribunal's conclusion that the applicant's evidence concerning what happened to his family strongly suggest that the essential and significant reason for these events was that criminals wanted to take control of his family's assets. 25 This conclusion was reached by Scarlett FM and I agree with his Honour's reasons."

The imposition of penalty is a matter for the Court ( NW Frozen Foods at 290) and the assessment of the appropriate penalty involves exercising a discretion taking into account all relevant factors ( Markarian at [27]).

I am mindful of the fact that the AKA has agreed to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs of the proceedings in an amount to be agreed. I am conscious of the fact that this is a voluntary organisation conducting kart racing in the interests of an interested section of the public. I have taken into account the various factors elucidated in Mobil Oil regarding the public interest in the settlement of litigation.

Associate: Dated: 6 November 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr D Godwin Solicitor for the Applicant: Corrs Chambers Westgarth Counsel for the Respondents: Mr J Stephenson Solicitor for the Respondents: Simpson &amp; Partners Solicitors Pty Limited Date of Hearing: 24 September 2009 Date of Judgment: 6 November 2009 Annexure A THE COURT DECLARES THAT: Each of the first respondent (""the AKA""), second respondent (""Wagga Kart Club""), the third respondent (""Newcastle Kart Club"") and the fourth respondent (""Manning Valley Kart Club""), by making a contract or arrangement or arriving at an understanding containing provisions that: (a) each of the AKA clubs with bitumen kart circuits (""Kart Circuits"") would not offer to supply, and would not supply Kart Circuit hire services at a price less than $4,000 plus GST per day for country clubs and $6,000 per GST per day for metropolitan clubs (""Minimum Hire Fee""); and (b) any negotiations for the supply of Kart Circuit hire services would be conducted by the AKA; made a contract or arrangement or arrived at an understanding (""Kart Circuit Hire Understanding"") that: (c) had the purpose or the effect, or were likely to have the effect, of fixing, controlling or maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining of, the price for Kart Circuit hire services supplied by AKA clubs with Kart Circuits in competition with each other to customers or prospective customers in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory within the meaning of section 45A of the Competition Code of New South Wales (""the Code""); and (d) by reason of the matters alleged in subparagraph (c) above, is deemed to have the purpose or effect, or to be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in the market in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory for the supply of Kart Circuit hiring services within the meaning of section 4E of the Code (""Kart Circuit Market""), for the purposes of section 45(2)(a)(ii) of the Code; and thereby engaged in a contravention of section 45(2)(a)(ii) of the Code. Each of the AKA, Wagga Kart Club, Newcastle Kart Club and Manning Valley Kart Club, by making or arriving at the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding in circumstances where two or more parties to the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding supplied Kart Circuit hire services in competition with each other, made a contract or arrangement or arrived at an understanding which contained a provision, the purpose or a substantial purpose of which was to prevent, restrict or limit one of more of the following: (a) the supply by AKA clubs with Kart Circuits of Kart Circuit hire services to any kart series operator who is not an AKA member on condition that the customer pay at least the Minimum Hire Fee; and (b) the acquisition by any kart series operator who is not an AKA member of Kart Circuit hire services from AKA clubs with Kart Circuits on condition that the customer shall pay at least the Minimum Hire Fee; being an exclusionary provision within the meaning of section 4D of the Code, and thereby engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(a)(i) of the Code. The fifth respondent (""Dubbo Kart Club""), by its conduct in corresponding with the AKA regarding the hire of the Lincoln County Raceway by Prokart for the Minimum Hire Fee or a higher fee, gave effect to the provisions of the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding as characterised in declarations 1 and 2 above and thereby: (a) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Code; and (b) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(i) of the Code. The AKA, by its conduct in liaising with Prokart and Dubbo Kart Club regarding the hire of the Lincoln County Raceway for the Minimum Hire Fee or a higher fee, gave effect to the provisions of the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding as characterised in declarations 1 and 2 above and thereby:: (a) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Code; and (b) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(i) of the Code. 5. Manning Valley Kart Club, by its conduct in: (a) advising Prokart that any negotiations for the supply of Kart Circuit hire services would be conducted by the AKA; and (b) liaising with the AKA regarding the hire of the Manning Valley Kart Circuit by Prokart for the Minimum Hire Fee; gave effect to the provisions of the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding as characterised in declarations 1 and 2 above and thereby: (c) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Code; and (d) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(i) of the Code. The AKA, by its conduct in liaising with Prokart and Manning Valley Kart Club regarding the hire of the Manning Valley Kart Circuit for the Minimum Hire Fee, gave effect to the provisions of the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding as characterised in declarations 1 and 2 above and thereby: (a) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Code; and (b) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(i) of the Code. Newcastle Kart Club, by its conduct in liaising with the AKA regarding the hire of the Newcastle Kart Circuit by Prokart for the Minimum Hire Fee, gave effect to the provisions of the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding as characterised in declarations 1 and 2 above and thereby: (a) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Code; and (b) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(i) of the Code. The AKA, by its conduct in liaising with Prokart and Newcastle Kart Club regarding the hire of the Newcastle Kart Circuit, gave effect to the provisions of the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding as characterised in declarations 1 and 2 above and thereby: (a) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Code; and (b) engaged in conduct in contravention of section 45(2)(b)(i) of the Code. The sixth respondent (""Mr Erdmann"") by his involvement in the making of or arriving at the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding with the knowledge of the essential elements of the contraventions of section 45(2)(a)(ii) and section 45(2)(a)(i) of the Code referred to in declarations 1 and 2 above, was a person directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, those contraventions, which constitutes conduct of the kind referred to in section 75B(1)(c) and/or section 80(1)(e) of the Code. The seventh respondent (""Mr Whiting"") by his involvement in the making of or arriving at the Kart Circuit Hire Understanding with the knowledge of the essential elements of the contraventions of section 45(2)(a)(ii) and section 45(2)(a)(i) of the Code referred to in declarations 1 and 2 above, was a person directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, those contraventions, which constitutes conduct of the kind referred to in section 75B(1)(c) and/or section 80(1)(e) of the Code. AND, the Court orders that: The AKA pay to the Commonwealth a total pecuniary penalty of $10,000 within three months of the date of this order. That the AKA be permanently restrained whether by itself, its servants or agents from: (a) making, or arriving at; (b) giving effect to; or (c) attempting to make or arrive at, or give effect to; any contract, arrangement or understanding with any two or more AKA members in Australia which contains a provision that: (d) has the purpose or the effect, or is likely to have the effect, of fixing, controlling or maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining of, the price for Kart Circuit hire services supplied by AKA clubs with Kart Circuits to customers or prospective customers in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory; or (e) has the purpose of preventing or restricting one or more of the following: (i) the supply by AKA clubs with Kart Circuits of Kart Circuit hire services to any kart race series operator who is not an AKA member on condition that the customer pay at least a minimum hire fee; or (ii) the acquisition by any kart race series operator who is not an AKA member of Kart Circuit hire services from AKA clubs with Kart Circuits by the imposition of a condition that the customer pay at least a minimum hire fee. An injunction permanently restraining each of Wagga Kart Club, Newcastle Kart Club, Manning Valley Kart Club, Dubbo Kart Club whether by themselves, their servants or agents from: (a) making, or arriving at; (b) giving effect to; or (c) attempting to make or arrive at, or give effect to; any contract, arrangement or understanding with any other AKA member in Australia which contains a provision that: (d) has purpose or the effect, or is likely to have the effect, of fixing, controlling or maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining of, the price for Kart Circuit hire services supplied by AKA clubs with Kart Circuits to customers or prospective customers in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory; or (e) has the purpose of preventing or restricting one or more of the following: (i) the supply by AKA clubs with Kart Circuits of Kart Circuit hire services to any kart race series operator who is not an AKA member by the imposition of a condition that the customer pay at least a minimum hire fee; or (ii) the acquisition by any kart race series operator who is not an AKA member of Kart Circuit hire services from AKA clubs with Kart Circuits by the imposition of a condition that the customer pay at least a minimum hire fee. An injunction permanently restraining each of Mr Erdmann and Mr Whiting whether by themselves, their servants or agents from: (a) attempting to induce the making, or arriving at, or the giving effect to; or (b) being knowingly concerned in, or party to, the making or arriving at, or giving effect to; any contract, arrangement or understanding with any two or more AKA members in Australia which contains a provision that: (c) has purpose or the effect, or is likely to have the effect, of fixing, controlling or maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining of, the price for Kart Circuit hire services supplied by AKA clubs with Kart Circuits to customers or prospective customers in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory; or (d) has the purpose of preventing or restricting one or more of the following: (i) the supply by AKA clubs with Kart Circuits of Kart Circuit hire services to any kart race series operator who is not an AKA member by the imposition of a condition that the customer pay at least a minimum hire fee; or (ii) the acquisition by any kart race series operator who is not an AKA member of Kart Circuit hire services from AKA clubs with Kart Circuits by the imposition of a condition that the customer pay at least a minimum hire fee. 15. The AKA shall: (a) within three months of the date of this order, establish an education training and trade practices compliance program (""Compliance Program"") for officers and employees of its business, which is designed to instil an awareness of the prohibitions contained in Part IV of the Code (including section 45 and section 45A) in relation to the contravening conduct in this proceeding or any similar or related conduct; b) within one month of the date of this order, appoint a legal adviser to advise the AKA as to the content of the Compliance Program; (c) implement and administer the Compliance Program for a period of three years from the date it is established; (d) within three months of the date of this order, prepare a written report to the applicant (""the ACCC"") on the content of the Compliance Program; and (e) provide a further report to the ACCC on the implementation and administration of the Compliance Program at the conclusion of each period of 12 months during which the Compliance Program is being implemented and administered. The AKA shall within three months of the date of this order, cause to be sent to each member of the AKA a letter substantially in the form of Attachment 1. The AKA to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs of the proceedings in an amount as agreed between the parties. ATTACHMENT 1 Letter to AKA members [To be placed on the AKA letterhead] [Date] Dear Sir/Madam Anti-competitive arrangement by the AKA Following civil proceedings instituted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (""ACCC""), the Federal Court of Australia has found that the Australian Karting Association (NSW) Incorporated (""the AKA"") and three AKA members made an anti-competitive arrangement at the annual general meeting of the AKA which was held on 19 July 2008. The Court has declared that the AKA engaged in anti-competitive conduct (contravening the Competition Code of New South Wales (""the Competition Code"")) by making an arrangement: to fix the minimum price for the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs (which is said to substantially lessen competition); and to prevent, restrict or limit the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs to non-AKA members by imposing a condition that the non-AKA members pay at least the minimum price (which is an exclusionary provision); and later giving effect to the above arrangement. The Competition Code has the same provisions as the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), but applies to individuals and non-trading associations such as AKA clubs. One of the Court's orders is that the AKA must write to each member to notify them of the outcome of these proceedings and to inform them of the illegality of making and giving effect to arrangements which substantially lessen competition or contain an exclusionary provision. The AKA has been ordered to pay a penalty of $10,000 and to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs. The Court has also granted injunctions restraining the AKA from making arrangements of this kind in the future and has ordered that the AKA establish a trade practices compliance program. If as an AKA member you: agree with other AKA members to a minimum or set price for the hire of kart circuits; agree with other AKA members to prevent, restrict or limit the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs to a particular class of persons on particular conditions; or give effect to an agreement set out above, you may be in breach of the Competition Code and may be liable to pay fines of up to $10,000,000 for a company or $500,000 for an individual, as well as damages for any loss that is caused.

Case1474,cited,Mornington Inn v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383,"76 of the Code sets out certain matters as relevant matters to which the Court should have regard in determining an appropriate pecuniary penalty. The parties in the joint submissions referred to further relevant factors addressed by French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152-52,153 and expanded upon in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 and J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532. It is uncontroversial as between the parties that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved ( Mornington Inn v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at [42] - [45] , [91] per Stone and Buchanan JJ)."
Case1475,applied,NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285,"76 of the Code sets out certain matters as relevant matters to which the Court should have regard in determining an appropriate pecuniary penalty. The parties in the joint submissions referred to further relevant factors addressed by French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152-52,153 and expanded upon in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 and J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532. It is uncontroversial as between the parties that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved ( Mornington Inn v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at [42] - [45] , [91] per Stone and Buchanan JJ). The parties also recognise that a principal object of a penalty under s 76 is deterrence ( NW Frozen Foods ). As elaborated, the concept of deterrence is to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act ( TPC v CSR at 52,125 per French J), or to deter others who might be tempted to think that contravention would be of benefit and detection would lead merely to a compliance program for the future ( NW Frozen Foods at 294 295 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ). The need to achieve general deterrence as well as specific deterrence means that a party's capacity to pay must be weighed against the need to impose a sum which members of the public will recognise as significant and proportionate to the seriousness of the contravention ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 265 ; (2005) 215 ALR 301 at [39] per Goldberg J). Bearing in mind the process as set out by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 for the assessment of criminal sanctions where penalties are not fixed by statute, the ACCC and the AKA jointly submit that a total pecuniary penalty of $10,000 imposed on the AKA is appropriate and within the range of penalties that a Court would order in these circumstances. The parties point out that in considering the proposed agreed penalty, the Court should take into account the fact that a negotiated resolution may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market. The imposition of penalty is a matter for the Court ( NW Frozen Foods at 290) and the assessment of the appropriate penalty involves exercising a discretion taking into account all relevant factors ( Markarian at [27]). However, the parties submit that the Court should not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure except in a clear case ( NW Frozen Foods at 291, approved and explained in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 ; (2004) ATPR 41-993)."

The parties submit that the proposed declarations, in a convenient and abbreviated form, sufficiently identify the contravening conduct ( Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [89] [90]) and thereby provide context for the pecuniary penalties. Accordingly, the parties submit the declarations operate with the pecuniary penalties to achieve the objective of general deterrence. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the declarations in the form sought. Injunctions"

Case1478,cited,Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Limited (2000) 200 CLR 591,of the respondents has consented to the imposition of injunctions. The injunctions are available pursuant to s 80 of the Code and are in the nature of public interest injunctions ( ICI Australia Operations Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 255 to 256 per Lockhart J; Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Limited (2000) 200 CLR 591 at 602 per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J).
Case1479,referred to,"Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804","28 November 2008, the Court published its reasons for judgment on liability issues in this proceeding. In that judgment the Court found that the respondent Union contravened s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (""the Act""). This judgment deals with the question of the penalty, if any, which should be imposed on the Union for that contravention. These reasons should be read together with the reasons for judgment in the substantive matter ( Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804). The Union engaged in unlawful industrial action under the Act by the imposition by its organisers of limited and short lived bans on the performance of work at a building site called the University Hill site. The relevant portion of the judgment in the substantive matter is set out at [16] to [25]. The following points from that part of the substantive judgment are of particular current relevance: (a) 20 October 2005 a ban was placed on work at the site because of the lack of a female toilet whilst a female worker was present and the absence of a site contamination report; after 9.30 am no work was performed on the site, other than by two employees of the head contractor; there were only two sub-contractors working on site immediately before the imposition of the ban: (i) Crushtec Australia Pty Ltd &#8212; who had Ms Sally Belcher performing work on site; and (ii) V&amp;G Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd who had Mr Fred Gilliland and Mr Shannon Gilliland performing work on the site. (b) 21 October 2005"
Case1480,referred to,"Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517","recording that fine, I acknowledge that Union is a large body with considerable assets but it is a body which does not exist to make profit but exists for the benefit of its members; see Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517 at [8] per Gray J. It also should be acknowledged, in mitigation of penalty, that the relevant organisers, in imposing the bans, acted in response to what they perceived to be an unsafe workplace where as they were told by the site manager that no soil contamination report had been obtained for the site. The parties agree that each party should bear his and its own costs of the proceeding. I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.

Case1481,referred to,"Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426","about six months of the relevant events, the Union organised a seminar designed to educate its officials about the effects of the Act. This conduct indicates a desire to avoid repetition of conduct in breach of the Act; see Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [53] per Tracey J. There is similar previous conduct, most relevantly in Stuart-Mahoney . The events of which occurred about a fortnight before the current events, although that case is not a prior contravention it shows that similar conduct had been undertaken in the past. I say ""similar"" in a rather loose sense because the imposition of the overtime ban in that matter was far more serious and had far more widespread effects than the transient bans in this matter. Deterrence is important, both general and specific. That is why, notwithstanding the conduct of the head contractor which led to the short lived bans of little consequence, there should be some monetary penalty imposed to reflect that a statutory provision has been breached. It is not as if there was no alternative but to impose a ban. Focussed talks with the head contractor at a high level and/or a referral of the issue to the Commission and/or Worksafe inspectors were alternative available courses of action. In Stuart-Mahoney , Tracey J imposed a penalty of $20,000 for breach of s 38 of the Act in respect of events occurring about the same time as the instant events. Even taking into account the application of the totality principle in that case, the significance and seriousness of the current breach are far less than the circumstances considered by Tracey J. Accordingly, I consider a fine of $5,500 to be appropriate in the current circumstances."
Case1482,discussed,Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2005] FCA 424,"There was no serious dispute that the first respondent, who had been convicted of theft, breached his duties as a trustee. Thus, the declarations were not controversial. Rather, at the first hearing of this matter on 20 September 2004, the key question was whether the Commonwealth was entitled to recover the full amount of the bond or only for compensable loss: see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2005] FCA 424 ( Bradshaw 1) at [10] and following. 3 At the first hearing, the Commonwealth did not attempt to prove any costs incurred in relation to the investigation and prosecution of the first respondent. Rather, the Commonwealth pursued its claim that it was entitled to recover the full amount of the bond regardless of the amount of loss. I rejected this contention and held that the Commonwealth was entitled to recover only that which was proven to be its compensable loss: see Bradshaw 1 at [79]. 4 I also stated that I would not dismiss the application before giving the applicants an opportunity to adduce further evidence as to the quantum of the Commonwealth's loss: see Bradshaw 1 at [80]. I adjourned the further hearing of the proceeding to allow the Commonwealth this opportunity."
Case1483,discussed,Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22,"At the second hearing, the respondents' primary submission, which I ultimately accepted, was that the applicants should not be permitted to reopen their case to prove the quantum of loss: see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 ( Bradshaw 2) at [28]. Accordingly, I made the declarations sought by the applicants but their application of 12 August 2004 was otherwise dismissed. The issue of costs now falls for determination."
Case1484,referred to,Re Smith; ex parte Inspector-General in Bankruptcy [1996] FCA 1076,"The applicants submitted that the respondents should pay their costs on a party and party basis up to and including 15 April 2005 (the date I delivered reasons for judgment in Bradshaw 1 ). They conceded that they must bear the respondents' costs thereafter, although only on a party and party basis. There was, they said, nothing in their conduct of the case that warranted a departure from the usual course, because their reliance on Re Smith; ex parte Inspector-General in Bankruptcy [1996] FCA 1076 ("" Re Smith "") was not unreasonable and, in respect of the application to reopen, the Court had itself considered, as at 15 April 2005, that the applicants should be given an opportunity to quantify their loss. 8 The applicants contended that, even though no monetary order was made in their favour, they were partially successful in the proceeding. They noted that: (1) the respondents had not admitted that the first respondent breached the bond; (2) the first respondent argued unsuccessfully that the applicants' claim was statute-barred; and (3) the second respondent argued unsuccessfully that it had revoked its surety. The applicants observed that they had in fact established liability under the bond and as surety, although the applicants properly conceded that arguments (2) and (3) ""did not occupy a great deal of the court's time"". 9 The respondents contended that the making of the declarations was never controversial and that the real question in dispute was whether ""the bond was, in effect, a good behaviour bond, forfeitable without proof of loss"". They sought their costs on a party and party basis until 15 April 2005, after which they sought costs on an indemnity basis. They argued that costs incurred after 15 April 2005 were incurred unnecessarily because evidence quantifying loss could have been led at an earlier stage. They contended that they would not have incurred any costs subsequent to 15 April 2005 had the application to reopen not been made. In written submissions, the second respondent said that ""[t]he 'special or unusual' circumstances warranting an order for indemnity costs are the loss of time to the parties and the Court by the Applicants taking the approach that they did"". 15 I am of the view that the justice of the case warrants an award of indemnity costs in the respondents' favour for the period after 15 April 2005. The decision in Re Smith may explain the applicants' conduct at the first hearing but it does not explain their conduct thereafter. Further, whilst it is true to say that, as at 15 April 2005, the court itself considered that the applicants should be given an opportunity to quantify their loss, the court formed the contrary view when it was informed of the circumstances known to both parties and relevant to the issue. 16 As already stated in Bradshaw 2 at [23], these circumstances showed that the applicants should be taken to have opened and closed their case at the first hearing on the basis that they would not quantify their loss. Although there were factors militating in favour of a grant of leave to reopen, they were outweighed by contrary considerations. These considerations included that: (1) the applicants deliberately chose not to quantify the Commonwealth's loss at the first hearing; (2) prior to the first hearing, the applicants had plainly led the respondents to believe that the applicants were proceeding on the basis that quantum was irrelevant and, in any case, that the loss could not be quantified; (3) the applicants did not make any application for a split trial, although it was open to them to do so; (4) before the first hearing, the applicants knew that it would be said against them that they could not succeed without evidence quantifying their loss; and (5) whilst there were no pleadings, the issue in debate was clearly addressed in the correspondence between the parties prior to the first hearing. These considerations are also relevant to the respondents' application for indemnity costs. 17 Had had the applicants so chosen, they might have led evidence as to quantification at the first hearing. Had they done so, they could have argued that the Commonwealth was entitled to the amount of the bond but they could also have sought to quantify their loss in the event that the court preferred the respondents' submission on the point to theirs. Had the applicants done this, then there would have been no occasion for any subsequent hearings. The applicants took the stance, however, that the quantum of the loss was irrelevant and the loss could not be quantified. In my view, the applicants acted unreasonably in seeking to resile from the position that that they had adopted in communications with the respondents prior to and at the first hearing. The costs incurred by the respondents after 15 April 2005, when Bradshaw 1 was delivered, should be paid by the applicants on an indemnity basis. I reiterate that although, as at that date, I was minded to give the applicants a further opportunity to quantify their loss, I formed a clear contrary view once I was informed of the circumstances known to both parties, though not the court, as at that date."
Case1485,referred to,Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All E R 333,"The first respondent made an alternative claim for indemnity costs for the period following 28 June 2005. On that day, the applicants rejected a settlement offer, made by letter of 21 June 2005, for $23,248 ""in full and final settlement of all the Applicants' claims in this matter (exclusive of costs), being the total sum of all disbursements you have claimed"". Referring to Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All E R 333, the first respondent submitted that he should receive costs on an indemnity basis after that date. 18 As the first respondent noted, costs may also be awarded on an indemnity basis where a proceeding is unduly prolonged by an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233 per Sheppard J. The rejection of a Calderbank offer does not of itself warrant an order of indemnity costs, even if the offeree fails to secure a more favourable outcome in the proceedings. In order for there to be an indemnity costs order, the respondents must show that the applicants' rejection of their offer was so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs: see, e.g., Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 at 287-290 per Hely J. In this case, the applicants acted unreasonably in seeking to resile from the position that they had adopted in communications with the respondents prior to and at the first hearing. In my view, the rejection of the Calderbank offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances because, as at 28 June 2005 (after the directions hearing of 8 June 2005), the applicants should have appreciated that they would not be able to quantify the Commonwealth's loss unless granted leave to reopen their case, and that there were serious doubts that such leave would be forthcoming. This alternative basis would also support an award of indemnity costs in the first respondent's favour in respect of the period after 28 June 2005."

Case1499,applied,SZBDF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1493 ; (2005) 148 FCR 302,"The Federal Magistrate considered the ambit of s 422B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (""the Act "") and found, in the light of authority, that she was bound to follow the decision of the Federal Court in SZBDF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1493 ; (2005) 148 FCR 302, where Branson J considered the possible operation of principles of procedural fairness beyond the scope of the obligations imposed by s 424A of the Act and concluded there was no scope for any wider obligation to provide particulars of information in relation to the Tribunal's review process. Barnes FM found that the appellant's grounds of complaint in relation to the breach of common law rules of procedural fairness could not succeed since the effect of s 422B was that there was no obligation on the part of the Tribunal to put its concerns about the document to the appellant for explanation. 21 The appellant also complained that he was not given an opportunity to respond to the Tribunal's concerns about the Dum Dum Trinamool Yuba Congress letter which he tendered; however, as Barnes FM observed, s 422B of the Act , SZBDF , and SZEGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1514 at [29] (Edmonds J) constituted an answer to that suggestion. The Minister submitted that even if that were not the case, there was no denial of procedural fairness established, since the Tribunal did not find the letter to have been fabricated and thus there was therefore no error of the kind identified by a Full Federal Court in WACO . I believe it is unnecessary to consider the findings made in WACO in the light of the operation of s 422B."
Case1500,referred to,WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 77 ALD 1,"The Federal Magistrate considered moreover that the issue arising in WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 77 ALD 1 (Lee, Hill and Carr JJ) was distinguishable, as the Tribunal did not make here a positive finding of fraud but rather accorded the letter no weight. 12 In relation to grounds of review raised by the appellant below regarding the obligation of the Minister under s 424A(1) of the Act , the Federal Magistrate found no error to have been established. The country information and the Tribunal's comments on the implausibility of the letter transmitted by fax on 29 November 2003 from a Mr Baksi were excepted from any operation adversely to the Minister of s 424A(3) of the Act . Furthermore her Honour considered that the letter did not constitute a matter upon which the Tribunal relied upon as constituting the inconsistencies between the information provided to the delegate and that to the Tribunal, and further took the view moreover that the Tribunal's thought processes were not information falling within the scope of operation of s 424A(1) of the Act in any event. 13 The Federal Magistrate found in addition that there was no evidence to support the appellant's other grounds for review sought to be advanced in his submissions to the Court, and that the purported grounds for review sought by the appellant were in the nature of merits review of the Tribunal's decision. In the result, her Honour found no reviewable error was established and dismissed the application for review. 14 On 26 May 2006 the appellant filed a notice of appeal, which purported to challenge the Federal Magistrate's decision on a number of grounds. The notice of appeal included the following grounds: the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations and evidence; the Tribunal denied the appellant procedural fairness by failing to provide the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to respond to country information; the Tribunal failed to investigate the provenance of the letter from the Dum Dum Trinamool Yuba Congress, faxed on the 29 November 2003; the Tribunal made findings which were not open on the evidence; and that the Tribunal erred in finding that the appellant could avoid harm if he ceased to be involved in politics in India. 15 The appellant provided five pages of written submissions in support of the purported grounds of appeal. The Minister responded in detail to those submissions. When the appeal was called on for hearing, the appellant informed the Court to the effect that he had nothing to add beyond the scope and text of his written submissions. 16 The submissions of the appellant purportedly addressed the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and did not at least explicitly purport to address the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court. This reflects an unfortunate trend in the submissions of unrepresented appellants in migration cases. I will address below those written submissions of the appellant in any event, and by reference to the issue headings as formulated by the Minister. 17 On any fair and reasonable analysis of the reasons for judgment of Barnes FM, her Honour did not fail to take into account relevant considerations or evidence relating to the contention raised by the appellant that he would experience harm whenever he might be returned to India. The appellant was in that regard a member of the TMC, which on the evidence before the Tribunal is a political party that exists in West Bengal, and not the remainder of India. In any event, at the Tribunal hearing the appellant asserted that the reason why relocation was not possible was because of his upper middle class origins, language and ethnicity, which generalities of description were inferentially or inherently addressed in the Tribunal's reasons. In those circumstances, the purported case that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration was not made out. 18 In the appellant's written submissions, he also contended that the Tribunal failed to consider whether relocation was reasonable, since the police could still find him anywhere in India in relation to the alleged false charges. However that submission failed to recognise that the Tribunal rejected that claim for reasons which included the circumstance that the appellant had been able to live unhindered with relatives in Mumbai and that his departure to Australia was unhurried despite the receipt of a visitor's visa. 19 The appellant also asserted that the Tribunal failed to consider that the sporadic political violence it was said to have acknowledged as having occurred was a 'threat to life or liberty [or] significant harassment'; however the Tribunal did consider whether the violence, which it accepted occurred, would constitute serious harm within the meaning of s 91R(1)(b) of the Act and rejected the suggestion that it would do so. 21 The appellant also complained that he was not given an opportunity to respond to the Tribunal's concerns about the Dum Dum Trinamool Yuba Congress letter which he tendered; however, as Barnes FM observed, s 422B of the Act , SZBDF , and SZEGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1514 at [29] (Edmonds J) constituted an answer to that suggestion. The Minister submitted that even if that were not the case, there was no denial of procedural fairness established, since the Tribunal did not find the letter to have been fabricated and thus there was therefore no error of the kind identified by a Full Federal Court in WACO . I believe it is unnecessary to consider the findings made in WACO in the light of the operation of s 422B."

Case1502,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 78 ALJR 992,"The appellant asserted that the Tribunal fell into error by according no weight to the Dum Dum Trinamool Yuba Congress letter without any investigation on its part; however although the Tribunal has of course investigative powers under s 424 of the Act , it is not a condition to the exercise of its statutory power that it does so, and in that regard I was referred by the Minister to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 78 ALJR 992 at [43] (per Gummow and Hayne JJ). 24 The appellant's next contention was that the following findings were not open on the evidence before the Tribunal: (a) the Tribunal's adverse finding on credibility and the rejection of all of the appellant's claims; and (b) its further finding that the successful campaigns for election candidates did not make him a target for CPIM supporters."
Case1503,referred to,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407,"In relation to the first matter above, the Tribunal did not make any adverse credibility finding or reject each of the appellant's claims; the Tribunal gave the appellant the benefit of the doubt on a number of matters. Nonetheless, assessments as to credibility are matters essentially for the Tribunal to undertake. In support of that proposition, the Minister referred the Court to Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407. 26 In relation to the second matter above, the Tribunal based its conclusion on the evidence that the appellant gave and in the course of which he described the activities he undertook under the instructions received from others. I find that the Tribunal's finding that the appellant's ' activities demonstrate that he would not be perceived by his adversaries as having political influence or profile ' was open on the evidence. 27 Contrary to the assertion advanced by the appellant in ground 9 of the notice of appeal, the Tribunal did not find that the appellant could evade harm by not being politically active. Rather, as already outlined, the Tribunal found that he had not previously been subjected to persecution and did not have a profile likely to attract persecution in the future. Moreover the Tribunal established that the violence from the CPIM was sporadic, not state sponsored, and further that there was in place effective state protection."
Case1504,cited,Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 326,"On 30 March 2006, I found that the respondent ('Siminton') had committed contempt by breaching and failing to comply with certain orders made by Sundberg J on 15 December 2006 ('the Sundberg J orders): see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 326 ('the first judgment'). These reasons for judgment use the terms employed in, and are to be read together with, the first judgment. 2 The contempts committed by Siminton fall into two categories. The first category consisted of Siminton dealing with, and giving instructions in relation to, the disposition of moneys in certain bank accounts in the manner set out in charges 1.1 and 1.2 of the first statement of charge and in charges 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 of the second statement of charge ('the disposal contempts'): see [16]-[30] of the first judgment. The second category, which consisted of a failure by Siminton to post notices on two websites, was the subject of charge 1.5 of the first statement of charge ('the website contempts'): see [38]-[41] of the first judgment. 3 APRA submitted that the disposal contempts amounted to criminal contempt. In particular, APRA submitted that the disposal contempts were 'a calculated and clandestine attempt to withdraw funds from the Terra Nova Cache account, in deliberate defiance of paragraph 2(b) [of the Sundberg J orders], indicating [Siminton's] attitude to the Court's authority.' APRA pointed to, inter alia , the following factors to support its contention: 'The [disposal] contempts involve breaches...on 5 separate occasions... The Respondent deliberately disobeyed the orders. Large sums of money are involved in the breaches of paragraph 2(b) electronic transfers of $622,880 ... and an attempted cash withdrawal of $500 000. The contempts...were calculated and disguised. The contempts were committed in the context of proceedings against the Respondent alleging contraventions of the Banking Act where public funds may have become imperilled. There are no mitigating factors, such as contrition (the Respondent has not put on any affidavit material in support of his defence).' 4 I am satisfied that APRA's submissions as to the nature of Siminton's contempts are supported by the evidence and are plainly correct. On the evidence before the Court, it is clear that Siminton's disposal contempts were of an extremely serious kind and constituted wilful disobedience and contumacious disregard of the Court's orders. The seriousness of the breaches is underlined by the fact that Siminton's conduct was precisely the kind of conduct against which Sundberg J sought to guard by the making of the orders the subject of the contempt charges. The conduct involved the actual transfer of large sums of money ($536 880.18, $38 000, $43 000, $5 000 and $10 000 respectively) and an attempted cash withdrawal from a Bendigo Bank account of $500 000, all of which occurred shortly after Siminton became aware of the Sundberg J orders. I would add that the failure of Siminton to obtain the cash withdrawal of $500 000 from the Bendigo Bank account came about fortuitously and not as a result of any change of mind on the part of Siminton. I am prepared to infer that the nature and sequence of the transfers effected by Siminton, and his attempt to withdraw a significant amount of cash from an account with which he had no previous association, were an attempt by Siminton to avoid detection by APRA. I can more readily draw that inference in the absence of any explanation of the transactions in question by Siminton. The seriousness of the disposal contempts is exacerbated by the fact that, as a result of the transfers made in breach of the orders, amounts of $5 000, $10 000 and $43 880.18 (ie $617 880.18 transferred to Agios account via Technocash less $574 000 transferred from that account to the Bendigo Bank account) appear to have been taken outside the direct protection of the Sundberg J orders. That observation is made on the assumption that the $574 000 transferred to the Bendigo Bank account (of which Siminton attempted to withdraw $500 000) is still within the direct protection of the Sundberg J orders. 5 Because of the belated compliance by Siminton with the Sundberg J orders in relation to posting notices on the two websites, the website contempts are less serious. Although the website contempts evidence a disregard by Siminton for the orders of the Court, they would not, standing alone, warrant a term of imprisonment. 6 The findings set out above are based on the evidence adduced at the hearing on liability and on APRA's written submissions on liability and penalty filed prior to the penalty hearing. Siminton's response to APRA's evidence and submissions was to continue to maintain, as he is entitled to do, that he 'is constrained from personally giving evidence in support of his plea by his exercise of the right against self-incrimination'. Another response was to file some material to the effect that his solicitor was making an endeavour to settle the main proceeding. Siminton also filed a statement by a friend stating that he was of good character. His counsel supplemented that statement from the bar table. The responses set out above are relevant to penalty but, having regard to the seriousness of the contempt, carry little weight on the issue of penalty. 7 Siminton's counsel also relied on the fact that Siminton had no prior contempt convictions and had eventually posted at least one of the requisite notices. I accept that both of those matters should be taken into account in Siminton's favour on the issue of penalty. 10 As I explained at [10]-[11] of the first judgment, the distinction between civil and criminal contempt has lost much of its significance. In so far as the distinction might be relevant to penalty, I am satisfied that the disposal contempts involved deliberate defiance of the Sundberg J orders and constituted a criminal contempt. As stated above, because the disposal contempts were disguised steps calculated to defeat, and which in part defeated, the purpose of the Sundberg J orders, they amount to particularly serious contempts. 11 Although Siminton has not gone into evidence about his contempts, I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt in relation to the website contempts, in that I am prepared to regard them as not involving deliberate defiance. Accordingly, in so far as it may be relevant to penalty, I treat those contemps as civil contempts. 12 Siminton has provided no evidence about his financial circumstances. However, APRA has adduced some evidence relevant to that matter. He was made bankrupt on 9 August 2001 and has failed to provide a statement of affairs or to deliver up his passport as required by the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the BA '). As a discharge usually only occurs three years after the filing of a statement of affairs, the bankruptcy is likely to continue for at least three more years. Under s 58 of the BA , the property of Siminton, including 'after-acquired property' as defined in s 58(6) , vested in his trustee on his bankruptcy. A fine imposed on a bankrupt is not provable in bankruptcy (see s 82(3) of the BA ). There is no evidence that Siminton has any capacity to pay a fine and the interlocutory orders made in the proceeding prevent him from accessing any of the funds upon which he might otherwise lawfully draw upon to pay any fine. 16 I accept that imprisonment should be a last resort but, having regard to the circumstances outlined above, I am in no doubt that in relation to the disposal contempts a term of imprisonment is both appropriate and necessary to vindicate the Court's authority. I regard personal deterrence as remaining a significant factor but I regard general deterrence as being of particular importance in the present case. Freezing orders of the kind made by Sundberg J are commonly made by the courts in order to preserve the status quo pending an interlocutory or final hearing. If such orders were seen as being able to be disobeyed with impunity that would significantly undermine the ability of the courts to effectively administer justice according to law."
Case1505,applied,Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83,"In Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 , I accepted the following submission, which was made on behalf of the applicant in that case, as accurately setting out the principles relevant to the question of penalty for contempt: '1.5 In deciding the appropriate penalty, a court should consider the following factors: (1) contemnor's personal circumstances; (2) nature and circumstances of the contempt: R v West Australian Newspapers Ltd; Ex Parte DPP (WA) (1996) 16 WAR 518; (3) effect of the contempt on the administration of justice: Durack v Gallagher (1982) 44 ALR 272 at 286-7; (4) contemnor's culpability: Durack v Gallagher (1982) 44 ALR 272 at 286-7; (5) need to deter the contemnor and others from repeating contempt: DPP v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 732, Kirby P at 741; and (6) absence or presence of a prior conviction for contempt: Attorney-General (NSW) v Macquarie Publications Pty Ltd (1988) 40 A Crim R 405 at 410. However, other criminal history is irrelevant: R v Giscombe (1984) 79 Cr App R 79 at 84. 1.6 In deciding the amount of any fine the Court should take into account the contemnor's financial means: Smith v R (1991) 25 NSWLR 1. The court may also suspend the fine on terms. Contrition and apology 1.7 Genuine contrition and a full and ample apology may also reduce the penalty: R v Gray [1900] 2 QB 36 at 41-2; Superstar Australia Pty Ltd v Coonan &amp; Denlay Pty Ltd (No 2) (1982) 65 FLR 432 at 436. Imprisonment 1.8 It is widely accepted that the court should only impose a term of imprisonment in the most serious criminal contempt cases: Keeley v Justice Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 179; Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. 1.9 In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Hickey [1999] FCA 259 , Carr J held that imprisonment is a ""last resort"": see also R v Vasin (1985) 39 SASR 45; James (1985) 14 A Crim R 364; Skipper (1992) 64 A Crim R 260.'"
Case1506,cited,"Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2000] FCA 629","As with any deliberate defiance of the Court's orders, Siminton's disposal contempts have a severe and deleterious effect on the administration of justice. I observed in Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2000] FCA 629 at [79] that the rule of law in a democratic society does not permit any member of the society to pick and choose the laws or court orders that are to be observed and those that are not. I added: 'Maintenance of the rule of law in our society does not only require that parties are able to resort to courts to determine their disputes ( Patrick Stevedores Operation No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 31 ; (1998) 153 ALR 641 at [1] per Hayne J), it also requires that parties comply with the orders made by the courts in determining those disputes.'"
Case1507,cited,"Pelechowski v The Registrar, Court of Appeal [1999] HCA 19 ; (1998) 198 CLR 435","In Pelechowski v The Registrar, Court of Appeal [1999] HCA 19 ; (1998) 198 CLR 435 at 463 [88] McHugh J observed: 'if breaches of court orders were regarded as of little moment, respect for and observance of the law would inevitably deteriorate and, ultimately, pose a threat to social order.' 19 In my view, the object of general deterrence in the present case requires that a penalty be imposed that protects the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the Court's orders cannot be disobeyed with impunity. 20 APRA submits that for each of the disposal contempts the appropriate penalty is a sentence of imprisonment of nine months and that for each of the website contempts the appropriate penalty is a sentence of one month, with the sentences to be served concurrently. 21 The Court has a broad discretion as to penalty. Having regard to the factors set out above and the matters put forward by counsel on behalf of Siminton, the appropriate term of imprisonment for the disposal contempts is 10 weeks. I would add that had there been any prior contempt convictions, the penalty would have been significantly greater. I am also not prepared to accede to Siminton's submission that any sentence of imprisonment should be suspended. In the present case, there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to justify suspending the sentence. 22 As explained above, the website contempts did not involve deliberate defiance and therefore do not warrant imprisonment. Although I have expressed doubt as to the efficacy of a fine in respect of Siminton, I have decided that a fine of $5 000 is appropriate in respect of the website contempts. In arriving at that figure, I have given particular weight to the absence of any satisfactory explanation, regret, contrition or remorse on Siminton's part. 23 APRA sought to have Siminton pay its costs in respect of the contempt motions on a 'party-party' basis. I am satisfied that APRA is entitled to have its costs paid on that basis. Although APRA failed on its 'failure to file allegations', those allegations played a very small part in the contempt case. In the circumstances, I am prepared to order that Siminton pay APRA's costs of and incidental to the contempt proceedings on a party-party basis. As APRA pointed out, costs orders against a bankrupt are subject to s 58(3) of the BA .

As was stated by RD Nicholson J in analogous circumstances in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4pc.com [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 at 57-58 [155] , such an apology does not 'demonstrate any remorse to be taken into account'. Siminton's counsel also proffered an undertaking to comply with all of the orders of the Court. That undertaking is to do no more than Siminton is obliged to do in any event. 15 In the result, there is no evidence upon which I would be prepared to act that Siminton has displayed any regret, remorse or contrition about his contempts."
Case1509,followed,Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52,"Mr Oke submits that the execution of the Birchgrove warrant was illegal and that the AFP should be ordered to return, or destroy, the hard drive image. His application raises various issues regarding the provisions of Part IAA of the Act, and the interaction of those provisions with the common law of legal professional privilege, including the principle enunciated by the High Court in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52, that a document recording a privileged communication cannot be made the subject of a search warrant issued under s 10 (now s 3E) of the Act. 6 The validity of the Birchgrove warrant itself is not challenged. What is challenged is the validity of its execution. There are three issues to be determined on the application concerning the validity of the execution of the Birchgrove warrant: 1. Whether the execution of the search was invalid because it did not comply with s 3H of the Act, in that the copy of the warrant provided to Mr Oke at the commencement of the search did not contain the name of the issuing officer and the handwritten portion of the attestation clause; 2. Whether the execution of the search was invalid because the copy of the warrant provided to Mr Oke at the commencement of the search did not have attached a copy of the privilege notice; 3. Whether the seizure of the laptop computer was invalid because the executing officer did not have the requisite state of mind specified in s 3F of the Act or because it was the subject of a claim of legal professional privilege; Submissions were also directed to the appropriate forms of relief if any of those claims were made out. 7 A further issue arose on the amended application, but no longer arises. It concerned the purported return of the laptop computer, and then its re-seizure from Mr Oke, on 2 July 2004, apparently invoking s 3K of the Act. Senior counsel for the AFP during the hearing of the application acknowledged that the AFP's entitlement to retain the laptop computer or a copy of its hard drive was not enhanced by what occurred on 2 July 2004 or by s 3K of the Act. It is not therefore necessary to further address that issue. 101 In Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; 153 CLR 52 , the High Court by majority concluded that, in the event that legal professional privilege attaches to and is maintained in respect of documents held by a legal firm, those documents cannot properly be made the subject of a search warrant issued under s 10 of the Act. Section 10 of the Act has since been repealed but it is similar, for present purposes, to the relevant parts of ss 3E and 3F. In Baker v Campbell it was assumed that the documents in issue were privileged, as the matter was heard on a case stated. 102 The practical difficulties which may arise in circumstances where legal professional privilege is claimed in respect of documents which would otherwise fall within the terms of a search warrant were recognised by Wilson J, who said (at 97): ""It is asserted that a claim of privilege in circumstances where the proceedings in respect of which it is made have not begun immediately raises procedural difficulties if the claim is contested. There is no judge already seized of jurisdiction in the matter to determine the disputed claim. The interests of all parties must be protected pending a determination of the dispute. In my experience the procedural difficulties can be overcome consistently with that objective if the members respectively of the police force and the legal profession co-operate in a reasonable and responsible way. I do not think that it is necessary for the purposes of the stated case to explore the problem."" 103 Following the decision in Baker v Campbell, the Law Council of Australia and the AFP entered into an agreement as to the manner in which such claims should be treated. The terms of that agreement form the guidelines contained in the privilege notice and which were attached to the original Birchgrove warrant. 104 The privilege notice reads as follows: ""If a claim is made for legal professional privilege in respect of any document covered by the warrant, and if the person claiming privilege is prepared to co-operate with the executing officer, the following procedure will be followed to the extent to which it is possible to do so: 1. The executing officer or a constable assisting will prepare a list of the relevant documents in cooperation with the person claiming privilege. The list will show the general nature of each document, the ground on which privilege is claimed, and the name of the person claiming privilege; 2. The documents will be placed in an envelope or other container which will be sealed; 3. The list and the container will be endorsed with a note to the effect that, having regard to the claim for privilege, the warrant has not been executed in respect of the documents set out in the list and that those documents have been sealed in the container pending resolution of the claim; 4. The list and the container will be signed by the executing officer or constable assisting and the person claiming privilege; 5. The sealed container and a copy of the list will be delivered to a third party agreed between the executing officer or constable assisting and the person claiming privilege; 6. The third party shall hold the container and the copy of the list pending resolution of the claim for privilege; 7. Subject to any agreement to the contrary, the person claiming privilege will have four working days after delivery to the third party in which to commence proceedings to establish the privilege claimed. If proceedings are commenced within that time the sealed container and the copy of the list will be delivered to the registrar of the court in which the proceedings have been brought. The documents will then be held by the registrar pending the order of the court; 8. Subject to paragraph 9, if proceedings are not commenced within four working days, or such other period as may be agreed, the third party will deliver the documents, or such of them as the executing officer still wishes to examine, to the executing officer; 9. Nothing in this document prevents the executing officer from discussing a claim for privilege with the person raising the claim. If agreement can be reached on which documents are covered by legal professional privilege, and which are not, the third party will be asked to act in accordance with that agreement. If the person claiming legal professional privilege is not prepared to cooperate with the executing officer, it will normally be necessary for the executing officer or a constable assisting to examine each relevant document to determine whether there is a proper basis for seizure."" 105 Mr Oke contended that, as a matter of law, it is not possible to ""seize"" an item under the Act which is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege. 106 The respondent submitted that the effect of the decision in Baker v Campbell is only that a search warrant cannot be executed in a manner which abrogates or nullifies the claim of privilege. It was said that to ""seize"" a document or thing means to take it into lawful possession subject to the claim of privilege being determined, so that seizure under the Act was still possible even if the seized item may ultimately be recognised as privileged. 107 I do not accept either contention. In my view, Baker v Campbell decides that a search warrant cannot authorise the seizure of privileged documents. The Birchgrove warrant must therefore be read as authorising seizure of the documents that satisfy the conditions specified, provided that they are not documents subject to legal professional privilege. Nor does it decide that a search warrant cannot authorise the seizure of documents in respect of which there is merely a claim to legal professional privilege. That question did not arise. Nor, upon my reading of the judgments in Baker v Campbell , is there anything said in that case to support such a contention. 112 I consider their Honours' conclusion is consistent with the decision in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; 153 CLR 52. In Baker v Campbell the documents the subject of the search warrant were assumed to be privileged from disclosure or production on the ground of legal professional privilege. In that event, they could not be the subject of a search warrant under the Act. So, here, if the laptop computer and all its contents were to be so protected, it could not have been the subject of the Birchgrove warrant and its seizure would not have been authorised. The approach of the Full Court in JMA Accounting addresses the circumstances where there is a contested claim to such privilege and the practicality that it cannot be immediately resolved (and where s 3K(2) has not been availed of)."
Case1510,distinguished,Seeter Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (2004) 210 ALR 437,"Spender J considered the validity of a series of s 3E search warrants which failed to name the issuing officer in Seeter Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (2004) 210 ALR 437. In that case, the attack was upon the validity of the warrants, rather than upon the validity of their execution. His Honour concluded at 453-454, [60]-[63] that the omission of the issuing officer's name did not invalidate the warrants. He noted at 453, [60] that each page of the search warrants under consideration bore the registration number and signature of the issuing officer, and the official stamp of the issuing authority. In those circumstances, Spender J was satisfied that the issuing officer had ""adequately identified her capacity to issue the warrants"": at 454, [63]. Although I was referred to that case by counsel, on reflection I do not think it assists in resolving the present issue. The Birchgrove warrant itself is not under attack, and it contains the name of the issuing officer as well as a completed attestation clause. 44 Part IAA of the Act was introduced by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). It clearly prescribes specific powers and safeguards in relation to warrants and other matters in the investigation of Commonwealth offences, including safeguards of the rights of individuals in relation to whom the coercive investigatory powers of the Commonwealth are invoked. Of particular significance to the present issue is that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1994 (Cth) stated, in relation to s 3H(5): ""In order to prevent forgery or other wrongful use of the warrant copy, subsection 3H(5) provides that the copy need not include the signature of the issuing officer or the seal of the Court. This provision has been included at the specific request of the ACT Chief Magistrate."" 45 There is no prescribed form for a search warrant issued under s 3E. Subsections 3E(5), (6) and (7) specify information which an issuing officer must state in a search warrant issued under that section. That information includes the time at which the search warrant expires: s 3E(5)(e). Section 3E(5A) directs that the time so specified must be not later than the end of the seventh day after the day on which the search warrant is issued. Those subsections do not expressly require the issuing officer to be described in, or to sign, the search warrant. 46 However, in my view, it is implicit that a search warrant will also bear on its face sufficient information to identify that it has in fact been issued by an issuing officer, so that any person entitled to see a copy of the search warrant under s 3H(1) can be satisfied as to its authenticity. That was the point made by Spender J in Seeter 210 ALR at 254, [63]. Section 3H(5) also supports the inference that a search warrant issued under s 3E should bear the signature of the issuing officer or some means of identifying that the issuing officer is in fact a person falling within the definition of ""issuing officer"" in s 3C(1) of the Act. That is because it expressly permits the copy of a search warrant made available under s 3H(1) not to include the signature of the issuing officer. The use of the seal of a court as part of that identification would not necessarily be expected, as the issue of a search warrant under the Act is an administrative or executive act rather than a judicial one. 47 On the Birchgrove warrant, the attestation clause was immediately preceded by words addressing the requirement of s 3E(5)(e) in the following terms: ""THIS WARRANT MAY BE EXECUTED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 6.00 AM AND 8.00 PM. THE TIME AT WHICH THIS WARRANT EXPIRES IS MIDNIGHT AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH DAY AFTER THE DAY ON WHICH THE WARRANT IS ISSUED"" In its unexecuted form, it then continued: ""GIVEN under my hand at ......... in the State of ..................... this ......... day of ..................... .......................................... A Magistrate in and for the State of ........................"" 48 The way in which the original Birchgrove warrant was completed by the issuing officer is described in [19] above. 74 The purpose of s 3H(1) has not been the subject of much judicial discussion. Nor was its purpose explored in the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law: Fourth Interim Report , Canberra, November 1990 (the Gibbs Committee Report) which presaged the introduction of Part 1AA into the Act by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). (The history of Part 1AA is discussed by the Full Court in Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australia Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 at 147-148.) In Wright v Queensland Police Service [2002] 2 Qd R 667, Holmes J at [30] referred to the ability of an occupier to whom a copy of a search warrant is made available being able ""to ascertain the scope of the authority conferred by [the warrant] or the jurisdiction by which it was issued"". That approach also is consistent with the approach of Spender J in Seeter 210 ALR 47."
Case1511,referred to,"Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 86 FCR 51","It is unclear whether the failure to attach the privilege notice constituted a breach of the Act. There is no requirement under the Act that a s 3E warrant contain a notice regarding an occupier's right to claim privilege over documents the subject of the warrant. In Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 86 FCR 51, French J held that a search warrant issued pursuant to the Act was not invalid for failing to expressly limit its scope to documents the subject of legal professional privilege. The applicant nevertheless maintains that if the AFP chooses to include the privilege notice in the original warrant it must, pursuant to s 3H(1), be included in the occupier's copy."
Case1512,referred to,Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49 ; (1997) 192 CLR 69,"I am not persuaded, in the circumstances, that the privilege notice was not ""made available"" to Mr Oke as part of the copy of the warrant. Section 5H(1) does not prescribe how or when the copy of a search warrant is to be made available. Whether it has been made available is a question of fact. Ideally, the copy should be made available at one time, and as early as possible. But having regard to the purpose of s 5H(1), if there were some delay in the commencement or progress of the search authorised by a search warrant, the copy might be made available at a later point in time if the purpose were not thereby frustrated. And, one can readily imagine, a page or pages of a copy might accidentally become removed from the copy prepared for presentation. In such a case, assuming the page or pages were otherwise significant (in the way identified above), the delay in providing them might not mean that they were not provided as part of the copy made available. If, upon inspecting the copy made available, the occupier noticed and drew attention to the fact that pages were missing, and they were then provided, I think s 5H(1) would have been satisfied. There are obviously many other possible circumstances. Having regard to the observations of Kirby J in Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49 ; (1997) 192 CLR 69 ( Ousley ) at 144, whether there has been compliance is a matter of fact and degree. On the evidence in this matter, I find that the privilege notice was provided to Mr Rydon at a sufficiently early point in the process of the execution of the Birchgrove warrant that its earlier absence had not affected adversely any claim for legal professional privilege Mr Oke made or the way in which his claim for legal professional privilege was treated. I therefore find that the provision of the privilege notice in the circumstances completed (in that respect) the making available of the Birchgrove warrant. 72 Moreover, subs 3E(5), (6) and (7) specify what the legislature considers must appear in a warrant. Those provisions appear to exhaustively state the matters the warrant must disclose to make it valid (see e.g. Ousley 192 CLR at 111). In general terms, they also define the extent of the authority conferred (see e.g. per Gaudron J in Ousley 192 CLR at 94), although s 3F then enlarges upon the extent of that authority. 73 Section 3E does not expressly require the name of the issuing officer to be included in the warrant. However, s 3H(5) indicates that the issuing officer will have signed the search warrant and by implication that the name of the issuing officer will appear on it. 80 In reaching that view, I am mindful that if the Birchgrove premises were unattended, the execution of the Birchgrove warrant may have proceeded lawfully even though the copy intended to be provided was incomplete. I do not think that consideration affects my conclusion. Kirby J in Ousley 192 CLR at 144 observed that ""Courts properly tend to take a practical rather than an unduly technical view of challenges to warrants permitting intrusion into the property and privacy of those subject to them"". The fact that, in different circumstances, the Birchgrove warrant might have been lawfully executed, or indeed the fact that the Birchgrove warrant itself was available to be provided to Mr Oke (but was not made available to him), does not diminish the significance of the non-compliance with s 5H(1) in the particular circumstances. 81 I am mindful that Federal Agent Capaldo had in her possession the Birchgrove warrant and could have made it available to Mr Oke. She did not however do so, but only provided a copy of the Birchgrove warrant in the form referred to above. 82 The omission of the privilege notice (assuming contrary to my view that, in this respect also, s 5H(1) was not complied with), does not have the same consequence. Its absence does not affect the capacity of Mr Oke to be satisfied of the nature of the authority being exercised or its extent. The copy of the Birchgrove warrant initially made available included the note quoted in [20] above. The fact that Mr Oke may have claimed legal professional privilege was therefore identified."
Case1513,cited,Arno v Forsyth (1986) 9 FCR 576,"It was submitted alternatively on behalf of Mr Oke that the later provision of the privilege notice meant that the Birchgrove warrant was not executed reasonably, and so was invalid, relying on Arno v Forsyth (1986) 9 FCR 576. The same findings lead me to conclude that there was not such unreasonableness in the execution of the Birchgrove warrant as to lead to its invalidity. 63 The failure to provide a complete copy of the original Birchgrove warrant (subject to s 3H(5)) amounted to a breach s 3H(1). There is nothing in the Act to suggest that the AFP can selectively determine which parts of a search warrant it will make available to the occupier, and which parts it will not. However, it does not necessarily follow that the effect of that breach is to invalidate the entire search."
Case1514,referred to,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"The majority of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 (McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) said at 388-9, [91]: ""An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition."""
Case1515,considered,Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384,"The construction of the Act, and particularly of s 3H, was considered (in a different context) by the Full Court of this Court in Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384. Relevantly, the Court said: ""[64] The construction of statutes authorising the search of premises and the seizure of things from them begins with the ordinary meaning of the words considered according to their context and the legislative purpose... [65] The purpose of search and seizure provisions is to provide for the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them: Rogers v Moore (1992) 39 FCR 201 at 217 per French J. Recognition of that purpose may yield a construction of the legislative words that is not necessarily narrowly defined. Remaining ambiguity or doubt whether of meaning or application will, in accordance with authority, be resolved in favour of the rights and freedoms of the subject... [68]...[E]ffect must be given to the importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences. Where the language of the statute authorising their use offers choices between one construction requiring fine legal judgments in the issue and/or execution of warrants and another which is more likely to be consistent with operational realities then the latter construction is generally to be preferred ..."""
Case1516,referred to,Lawrie v Muir [1950] SLT 37,"In their analysis of the competing policy considerations underpinning the Act, their Honours relied upon the following passage from the judgment of Lord Cooper in Lawrie v Muir [1950] SLT 37 (at 39-40): ""From the standpoint of principle it seems to me that the law must strive to reconcile two highly important interests which are liable to come into conflict (a) the interest of the citizen to be protected from illegal or irregular invasions of his liberties by the authorities, and (b) the interests of the State to secure that evidence bearing upon the commission of crime and necessary to enable justice to be done shall not be withheld from Courts of law on any merely formal or technical ground. Neither of these objects can be insisted upon to the uttermost. The protection of the citizen is primarily protection for the innocent citizen against unwarranted, wrongful and perhaps high-handed interference, and the common sanction is an action of damages. The protection is not intended as a protection for the guilty citizen against the efforts of the public prosecutor to vindicate the law. On the other hand the interest of the State cannot be magnified to the point of causing all the safeguards for the protection of the citizen to vanish, and of offering a positive inducement to the authorities to proceed by irregular methods."" 67 The invasion of premises without the consent of the occupier is authorised by a warrant issued under s 3E of the Act. The validity of such a warrant necessarily depends upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. The legislative imposition of those conditions reflects the balance struck between the desirability of an effective and efficient investigation of suspected criminal offences and the need to protect the right of an individual to enjoy that person's privacy and property."
Case1517,referred to,George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104,"The High Court in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 said at 111: ""... the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation."" (my emphasis) It must be recognised that that case concerned the validity of the issue of a search warrant, and not the validity of the execution of a validly issued search warrant, although the underlying principles referred to by the High Court would appear to me to apply equally in the case of the execution of a warrant. 69 The consequence of the failure to comply with such statutory conditions may lead to the invalidity of the search warrant itself. George v Rockett is an example. Counsel for Mr Oke also relied upon certain observations in Woodroffe v National Crime Authority [1999] FCA 591 at [14] - [15] , but I do not consider that case advances Mr Oke's position simply because it concerned an application by the National Crime Authority to summarily dismiss a challenge to the validity of a search warrant and to the manner of its execution. Consequently, the Court was called upon only to determine whether the grounds of the challenge were arguable. The copy of the search warrant made available to the person challenging the validity of the execution of the search warrant was assumed not to have included the privilege notice."

Case1519,referred to,"Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australia Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145","The purpose of s 3H(1) has not been the subject of much judicial discussion. Nor was its purpose explored in the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law: Fourth Interim Report , Canberra, November 1990 (the Gibbs Committee Report) which presaged the introduction of Part 1AA into the Act by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). (The history of Part 1AA is discussed by the Full Court in Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australia Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 at 147-148.) In Wright v Queensland Police Service [2002] 2 Qd R 667, Holmes J at [30] referred to the ability of an occupier to whom a copy of a search warrant is made available being able ""to ascertain the scope of the authority conferred by [the warrant] or the jurisdiction by which it was issued"". That approach also is consistent with the approach of Spender J in Seeter 210 ALR 47."
