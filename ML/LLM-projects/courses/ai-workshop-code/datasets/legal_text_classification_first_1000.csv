In summary those principles are: 1. Mere refusal of a ""Calderbank offer"" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs. In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]): if the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle. 2. To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable. 3.

Case5,cited,Dr Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602,"The preceding general principles inform the exercise of the discretion. That discretion is not to be fettered by transformation of approaches and practices developed through the cases into quasi statutory rules. In John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201 , Hill J said (at 203): care must be taken not to circumscribe the discretion by reference to closed categories.

Case6,cited,GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55,"I accept that the making of a rolled up offer inclusive of costs and interest may detract from the weight to be given to its refusal in the exercise of the discretion. Finn J referred to authorities on the point in GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55 at [34] . His Honour cited single judge decisions to the effect that such offers ought not to be a relevant consideration on the question of costs and would not be considered in the same way as a Calderbank letter. His Honour was invited to depart from that line of first instance authority. However he was not prepared to say it was clearly wrong. Notwithstanding that, in the circumstances of the case he had to decide, his Honour found that: The fact that the offer gave no indication at all of the breakdown ... between the claim, interest and costs blunts significantly the weight to be given the offer. 35 While respecting the general approach to rolled up offers reflected in the cases to which Finn J referred, such approaches cannot be calcified into rules of law which fetter a general discretion. They simply reflect a common sense proposition that generally speaking such an offer is not unreasonably refused. There may, however, be circumstances where a rolled up offer, refused by an applicant who is unsuccessful, may support a claim for indemnity costs."

Case8,cited,Seven Network Limited v News Limited (2007) 244 ALR 374,"On the question of the level of unreasonableness necessary to attract the discretion, I respectfully agree with the comment of Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [62] questioning the utility of substituting a requirement that rejection be ""plainly unreasonable"" for the requirement that it be ""unreasonable"". Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word ""plainly"" which is itself evaluative, has no useful function. 37 At the time that Sirtex made its offer to UWA the prospect of UWA succeeding against Sirtex depended critically upon: 1. UWA establishing its case against Dr Gray and, in particular, that he had breached his fiduciary duty. 2. UWA establishing that Sirtex was accessorially liable in relation to that breach, a position that depended upon establishing that Sirtex was aware of facts constituting (and which would have indicated to a reasonable person) the breach of fiduciary duties owed by Dr Gray to UWA. 38 It cannot be said that UWA acted unreasonably in proceeding on the basis that it had a reasonable cause of action against Dr Gray. True it is that the case as framed and presented depended upon an important proposition of law as to the existence of an implied term in the contract of Dr Gray's employment with UWA. But the correctness of that proposition had not previously been tested in Australia in circumstances of the kind which arose in this case. This is not a case, in my opinion, in which it is appropriate to take a hindsight test to the facts known to UWA at the time of Sirtex's offer and conclude that it ought to have known that the law was against it. 39 There were of course other hazards in the way of UWA's path to success against Dr Gray and therefore against Sirtex. The question whether the relevant inventions were made while Dr Gray was an employee of UWA was one issue upon which findings adverse to UWA were made on all but the DOX-Spheres technology. There was also a finding adverse to UWA that none of the Sirtex directors, apart from Dr Gray, were on notice of a potential claim. To establish any cause of action against Sirtex based on knowing involvement in his alleged breaches of fiduciary duty would have depended entirely upon his role as a director of Sirtex and whether his knowledge could be attributed to that company. In addition, UWA faced substantial defences by Sirtex based on UWA's delay in commencing proceedings after it first became aware of the facts relevant to its claimed causes of action. 40 The preceding factors may be seen as weighing to some degree in favour of the Sirtex motion. On the other hand the offer came as the trial commenced. That is a factor, given the focus on the trial process which would then have existed, that militates against a finding of unreasonableness on the part of UWA in refusing the offer. That conclusion is not affected by the fact that Sirtex was making a counter-offer. The counter-offer was not a variation on a theme opened by UWA's offers. It was quite different and could have been proposed earlier."
Case9,applied,Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46,"recent decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 clarifies this issue. Gleeson CJ and Crennan J (at [19]), after referring to various cases dealing with the grant of interlocutory injunctions in cases of defamation, formulated the general principles governing the grant of such relief in the following terms: ""in all applications for an interlocutory injunction, a court will ask whether the plaintiff has shown that there is a serious question to be tried as to the plaintiff's entitlement to relief, has shown that the plaintiff is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, and has shown that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction."""
Case10,followed,Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325,"Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325, the likelihood of irreparable harm was regarded by Stone J as, indeed, a separate element that had to be established by an applicant for an interlocutory injunction.

Had it not been for the fact that there will be a speedy trial of this matter, which Stone J regarded as a relevant consideration in Hexal v Roche (at [78]), I might have been inclined to grant some, at least, of the orders sought by CSL.

Case12,cited,R v McFarlane; Ex parte O'Flannagan and O'Kelly [1923] HCA 39 ; (1923) 32 CLR 518,"quia timet proceedings, the court will have regard to the degree of probability of the apprehended injury, the degree of the seriousness of the injury, and the requirements of justice between the parties. In R v McFarlane; Ex parte O'Flannagan and O'Kelly [1923] HCA 39 ; (1923) 32 CLR 518 Isaacs J observed (at 539): ""The Court is not entitled to apply the obstacle of injunction to the contemplated action of a co-ordinate branch of the Government unless not only a clear case of illegality, proved to be calculated to result in a clear injury, is established, but also it is shown that by no other means can injury be averted or sufficiently compensated for."" Dr I C F Spry, in Equitable Remedies (2001, 6 th ed), comments (at 378) that quia timet injunctions are not granted unless the imminence of the act to be prohibited is sufficiently clearly established to justify the court's intervention. The fact that there is no breach presently occurring may make it more difficult, as a matter of evidence, to establish that there is a sufficient risk of a future injury to justify the immediate grant of an injunction. If, in all the circumstances, the likelihood that an injury will take place is not sufficiently high, quia timet relief will be refused. The applicant will be left either to avail him or herself of such other remedies as may be open, or else to renew his or her application should the likelihood of an injury subsequently increase sufficiently to render equitable intervention appropriate. There is some debate as to whether a greater degree of proof is required in a case involving interlocutory quia timet relief than in a case involving a different kind of injunction. The issue is discussed in Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane (at [21-395]), and need not be further canvassed here. It is sufficient to note that, in many cases, it may be more difficult to prove that an apprehended injury will occur than it is to prove that an existing injury will continue."
Case13,followed,National Australia Bank v KDS Construction Services Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 65 ; (1987) 163 CLR 668,"It was not suggested in this proceeding that, so far as a Commonwealth revenue debt is concerned, there is any express statutory provision which alters the usual position which prevails as between creditor and debtor when a cheque is given in payment of a debt. That usual position was expressed by Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in National Australia Bank v KDS Construction Services Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 65 ; (1987) 163 CLR 668 , at 676 to be as follows: Generally speaking, when a cheque is given in payment of a debt, it operates as a conditional payment. The payment is subject to a condition that the cheque be paid on presentation. If it is dishonoured the debt revives. Although it is sometimes said that the remedy for the primary debt is suspended, the suspension is no more than a consequence of the conditional nature of the payment: Tilley v Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [1960] HCA 86 ; (1960) 103 CLR 529 , at pp 532-533, 535-536, 537. The condition is a condition subsequent so that, if the cheque is met, it ranks as an actual payment from the time it was given. Subject to non-fulfilment of the condition subsequent, the payment is complete at the time when the cheque is accepted by the creditor: Thomson v Moyse (1961) AC 967 , at p 1004. 14 It was submitted for the Deputy Commissioner that, in the events which had transpired in this case, that usual position had been altered by the signification by the Deputy Commissioner that he would agree to the dismissal of the winding up application once the proceeds of the cheque had been cleared. It seems to me though that the evidence is more consistent with the Deputy Commissioner's adopting a position which was in accordance with the general position when a cheque is given in payment of a debt. It has been accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation. Subject to the fulfilment of that condition, payment of the then outstanding amount of the debt due to the Commonwealth and payable to the Commissioner was complete upon the acceptance by the Deputy Commissioner on 10 November 2008 of the cheque then proffered on behalf of Ganter. In this regard, the fact that the proffered cheque was a bank cheque may well have provided a degree of comfort to the Deputy Commissioner in deciding to accept it, but the position would have been the same in law so far as the relationship of debtor and creditor was concerned had the cheque concerned been one where the drawer was other than a bank."
Case14,followed,George v Cluning (1979) 53 ALJR 767 (note),"Strictly speaking, a cheque, even a bank cheque, is not a form of legal tender. Subject to some particular contractual or statutory provision, the only forms of legal tender remain Australian notes or, subject to the limits specified, Australian coins see s 36 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and s 16 of the Currency Act 1965 respectively. However, in general trade and commerce, as Mason J observed in George v Cluning (1979) 53 ALJR 767 (note) by reference to Canadian authority, a payment by cheque can amount to sufficient payment if not objected to on that account. In this case there was no objection made by the Deputy Commissioner on account of Ganter's endeavouring to settle its indebtedness by the tendering of a cheque only, as I have noted a signification that it was accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation"
Case15,followed,Australian Mid-Eastern Club Limited v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399,"None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque. When the history of Ganter's endeavours to pay the debt after the filing of the winding up application is recalled and that the company was, by operation of s 459C(2)(a) the Corporations Act 2001 presumed to be insolvent the Deputy Commissioner would have been entitled not to accept the cheque. A refusal to accept the cheque would not have eliminated the debt in question: Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399 , at 403 (NSWCA); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830 at [3] per Gyles J."
Case16,followed,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830,"None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque. When the history of Ganter's endeavours to pay the debt after the filing of the winding up application is recalled and that the company was, by operation of s 459C(2)(a) the Corporations Act 2001 presumed to be insolvent the Deputy Commissioner would have been entitled not to accept the cheque. A refusal to accept the cheque would not have eliminated the debt in question: Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399 , at 403 (NSWCA); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830 at [3] per Gyles J. 21 In my opinion, the date for the determination of standing to apply for the winding up of a company is the date when the application is made. As it was when Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) was decided, the process for the winding up of a company remains today entirely statutory. By s 459A(1)(b) of the Corporations Act a creditor is one of the persons who may apply for the winding up of a company. The application for the winding up of Ganter was made by the Deputy Commissioner upon the filing of the application in this Court on 20 August 2008. At that time, the Deputy Commissioner was, on any view, a creditor. Like Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [5]), I am not persuaded that there is any requirement flowing from the Corporations Act that the applicant must continue to be a creditor at the time when the winding up application is heard. As his Honour there states (ibid), and though it is cited in a number of cases which he notes, the passage from the judgement of Menzies J in Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) does not support the existence of any such requirement. 22 The true position is that the applicant's status as a creditor at the time when the application was made and the presumption flowing from the company's failure to comply with the terms of a statutory demand are sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to order the winding up of the company. That was the conclusion reached by Zeeman J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Guy Holdings Pty Ltd (1994) 116 FLR 314 at 318. As did Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [6]), I agree with that conclusion. As Zeeman J observed in the Guy Holdings Case (at 320), ""in the case of an application under s 459P where the debt the subject of the statutory demand has been paid after the filing of the application, the application ought to be dismissed unless there is established some positive reason that a winding up order ought to be made"". His Honour is there referring to the way in which, in those circumstances, the discretion vested in the Court on the hearing of a winding up application by s 467 of the Corporations Act would ordinarily be exercised. 24 In their submissions the solicitors for the company pointed to the observation made by Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [8]), ""With trading companies the existence of a winding up proceeding is a very serious inhibition and has very serious impacts"". I respectfully agree. That is one reason why it behoves a company which wishes to keep trading to pay its debts as they fall due or at least later to comply with the terms of a statutory demand. It is also a reason why, all other things being equal, a Court would be disposed, as a matter of discretion, to dismiss a winding up application if satisfied that the debt owed to the applicant creditor had been paid. Another consideration not to be ignored is the protection of the revenue. Yet another consideration is that Ganter, by its solicitors, initially agreed with the Deputy Commissioner's proposal that on 13 November 2008 the adjournment of the application for one week ought to be sought. A further consideration is the public interest in whether a company which is presumed to be insolvent ought to be permitted to continue to trade or whether it ought to be wound up. 25 Ganter's change of heart as to the course which ought to be taken on 13 November 2008 seems to have been multi-factorial in origin. Inferentially from the submissions made to me and to the District Registrar it was founded upon what I regard as the misapprehension that the payment of an applicant creditor's debt obliged the Court to dismiss a winding up application, as opposed to that being a factor going to discretion. Likewise, it seems to have been grounded on the belief that the acceptance of the bank cheque by the Deputy Commissioner extinguished the debt then and there, as opposed to so doing upon the fulfilment of the condition subsequent of the cheque's being cleared. Further, it seems to have been grounded upon the belief that, the cheque payment having been recorded as a credit on 11 November 2008 in its accounts, the Deputy Commissioner was obliged, as a ""model litigant"" to agree to the dismissal of the winding up application on 13 November 2008. 26 This, with respect, misapprehends the obligation that falls on those representing the interests of the Crown in civil litigation. One of those interests, and it is a vital interest, is the protection of the revenue. The Deputy Commissioner would certainly have failed in his duty to the Court as a model litigant had the acceptance of the cheque and the terms upon which it had been accepted not been drawn to the Court's attention on 13 November 2008. It was. Especially as matters then stood as to the clearing of the bank cheque and the Deputy Commissioner's knowledge as to the practice of the NAB in relation to the circumstances in which it would not meet a bank cheque and the time within which any such disposition on the part of the bank would usually be signified, it was not unreasonable for the Deputy Commissioner to resist the dismissal of the application that day. The position then to take was a matter for the value judgement of the Deputy Commissioner in the circumstances in the administration of the taxation laws. The entry in the accounts of the ATO had no more than a provisional quality about it."
Case17,followed,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Guy Holdings Pty Ltd [1994] TASSC 126 ; (1994) 116 FLR 314; (1994) 14 ACSR 580,"The true position is that the applicant's status as a creditor at the time when the application was made and the presumption flowing from the company's failure to comply with the terms of a statutory demand are sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to order the winding up of the company.

Case19,cited,Motor Terms Co Pty Ltd v Liberty Insurance Ltd [1967] HCA 9 ; (1967) 116 CLR 177,"Assuming that the Deputy Commissioner ought presently to be regarded as an applicant whose debt has been paid, it does not, with respect, seem to me to follow that the application must therefore necessarily be dismissed. In his judgment in Motor Terms Co Pty Ltd v Liberty Insurance Ltd [1967] HCA 9 ; (1967) 116 CLR 177 , at 194-195, Menzies J, in what is strictly an obiter dictum , opined: In the course of argument upon this appeal, reference was made to the consequence of a petitioning creditor being paid off between the presentation of the petition and the making of an order. That circumstance would not, in my opinion, put an end to the petition nor would it affect the jurisdiction of the court to hear and determine the petition although, of course, in such circumstances proceedings might not be continued and, if they were, the court could, in the exercise of its discretion, refuse to make a winding up order upon the petition of a person not then a creditor. In that same case, Barwick CJ (at 179) also seems to have been of the view that, under the then statutory regime for the winding up of a company, the date for the determination of whether a petitioner was a creditor was the date of presentation of the winding up petition. 21 In my opinion, the date for the determination of standing to apply for the winding up of a company is the date when the application is made. As it was when Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) was decided, the process for the winding up of a company remains today entirely statutory. By s 459A(1)(b) of the Corporations Act a creditor is one of the persons who may apply for the winding up of a company.

Case21,referred to,Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Appellant S396/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473,"am satisfied that the finding of the third Tribunal that the two appellants are not, and were not, homosexuals was not made in the exercise of honest fact finding, but was deliberately calculated to ""get around"" difficulties in the factual circumstances of the appellants' case, thrown up by the judgment of the High Court in Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Appellant S396/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 ( Appellant S395/2002 ). The appellants are Bangladeshi nationals. They came to Australia, arriving on 19 February 1999. They sought protection visas on 4 March 1999, claiming that they were homosexuals who had lived together as a couple since 1994, and that they had been subjected to persecution in Bangladesh because of their homosexuality. A delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship found, on 23 April 1999, that the applicant born on 1 July 1973 (NAOX, or the younger Bangladeshi), was a ""citizen of Bangladesh"", accepted ""as plausible the applicant's claim that he is a homosexual"", but was ""unable to accept there is a real chance that he will be persecuted on that ground in Bangladesh"". The delegate said: In his circumstances, if he believes that his homosexuality, and his relationship, would not be acceptable to the community in which he is living, it is only reasonable to believe that he should be discreet about such matters. It is important to have regard to the issues before the High Court in Appellant S395/2002 : The [first] Tribunal accepted that the appellants were homosexual, and that homosexual men in Bangladesh are a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , as amended by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees , as amended by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees 1967. However, the Tribunal rejected most of the claims made by the appellants as to the persecution they had suffered in Bangladesh, including claims that they had experienced threats and violence over many years. It found that they had not in the past suffered serious harm by reason of their homosexuality, observing that they had ""clearly conducted themselves in a discreet manner and there is no reason to suppose that they would not continue to do so if they returned home now"". Further: The [Tribunal] rejected their claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh by reason of their homosexuality. The Tribunal rejected most of their individual claims, but accepted that it was not possible to live openly as a homosexual in Bangladesh. It found, however, that the applicants had ""clearly conducted themselves in a discreet manner and there is no reason to suppose that they would not continue to do so if they returned home now"". The applicants contended that the Tribunal had erred in law by imposing upon them a requirement that they live discreetly in order to avoid persecution. All the members of the High Court held that the (first) Tribunal: ... had not imposed a requirement that the applicants live discreetly if they returned to Bangladesh. It had made a finding of fact that they would live discreetly. That finding did not itself involve error."
Case22,cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang (2003) 215 CLR 518,"is plain that, where an order is set aside, and a matter is remitted to the Tribunal for reconsideration, there is nothing on which any issue estoppel can be founded: Morales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 334 ; (1998) 82 FCR 374 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang (2003) 215 CLR 518.

Case34,cited,ASIC v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd (2002) 20 ACLC 1530,"There is a variety of ways in which the interests of persons, to whom liabilities may be owed, can be protected by orders made under the section. The nature of the protection can vary according to the nature of the risks assessed. As Palmer J said in ASIC v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd (2002) 20 ACLC 1530 at [37]: '... there may be evidence to suggest that fraud has been perpetrated on a large scale and that many of the victims have no or little information about the extent of the fraud, no or little means for their own investigations, and no or little resources to prosecute their own claims. In such a case, the interests of such persons are protected, within the contemplation of s 1323, by enabling ASIC to conduct an investigation for the purpose of identifying the wrongdoers and exposing them not only to penalties under the Corporations Act and other legislation, but also to claims for compensation from the victims themselves.' `"
Case35,cited,CAC v Lone Star Exploration NL (1988) 14 ACLR 499,"The orders that can be made under the section are directed, inter alia, to the preservation of assets against which recovery may be sought in the event that liability to an 'aggrieved person' is established on the part of a 'relevant person'. The orders are made in circumstances where 'an investigation is being carried out', 'a prosecution has been begun' or 'a civil proceeding has been begun'. That is to say the orders can be made before liability is established and indeed before the evidence necessary to establish liability has been collected. While an application under the section is not interlocutory in an existing criminal or civil proceeding, it is interlocutory in a wider sense. It preserves the status quo and the assets of the relevant person pending the outcome of the investigation, prosecution or civil proceedings which are on foot CAC v Lone Star Exploration NL( No 2) (1988) 14 ACLR 499 at 504. At the stage an order is sought the Court may not be in a position to identify with precision any particular liability owed by the person the subject of the proposed order. This consideration applies to final orders made under the section as well as to interim orders for which it expressly provides in s 1323(3). The final orders made under the section are necessarily of a temporary or holding character rather than finally disposing of the rights and liabilities of the relevant persons affected by them."

Case38,cited,ASIC v Burke [2000] NSWSC 694,"It is not a necessary consequence of an order appointing a receiver that the receiver should deal with or liquidate the assets in question. The interlocutory and protective character of orders made under s 1323 must be borne in mind when defining the powers of the receiver. The appointment of a receiver has rightly been described as 'an extraordinary step' ASIC v Burke [2000] NSWSC 694 at [8] (Austin J). However depending upon the nature of the powers conferred on the receiver it may be less drastic than a freezing order which can only be varied by order of the Court. The interlocutory history of this case has already demonstrated that circumstances not contemplated when the original interim freezing orders were made have required their variation from time to time. I accept, with respect, the observation made by Austin J in Burke at [8]: 'Without wishing to lay down any general rules, it appears to me that the extraordinary step of appointing a receiver may be justified, even though Mareva Orders are in place, in a case where there is real doubt about the existence and location of assets such as investments, and about the number and identity of claimants and the nature of their claims, and additionally the defendants are engaged in business activities which entail that any Mareva Orders must allow assets to be turned over in the course of business. Where these circumstances exist in combination, and especially where there are allegations of serious fraud involved, the Court may conclude ...that the Mareva Orders are not enough to ensure that the assets are preserved and protected, and indeed identified and brought in for the benefit of investors.' The decision was cited with approval by Santow J in ASIC v Adler (supra) at 268-269. 30 Section 1323 does not make any express provision for the nature of the evidence on which the Court may act in making orders under it. Applications made under the section have an interlocutory character albeit there are no other specific proceedings to which they may relate. The section does not require concluded findings of fact about liability or whether assets have been dissipated. For the reasons already canvassed the Court, in making orders under s 1323 , engages in a risk assessment and management process. The logic of the section assumes that the Court will not always have before it evidence of the kind that would be necessary and admissible in proceedings to establish definitively the nature and extent of the assets of the persons under investigation and their liability to aggrieved persons. Nor will it necessarily have before it evidence of the kind that would establish definitively that dissipation of assets has occurred or is likely to occur or that flight is imminent. 31 The logic of s 1323 requires the Court to be able to act on evidence which might not be admissible in civil or criminal proceedings leading to a definitive determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties. Hearsay evidence may therefore be received and acted upon, not as proof of the truth of its content but as evidence of the existence of a risk or possibility that gives rise to the necessity for or desirability of a protective order. It is not necessary, in this context, to consider whether the proceedings are interlocutory for the purposes of the exception to the hearsay rule under s 75 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) albeit that that exception is no doubt informed by similar considerations. Evidence may be received of the opinion of a suitably qualified person who has had the opportunity to review extensive documentation collected in the course of an investigation and to offer an overview of it for the benefit of the Court. In such a case the opinion or overview should be supported by reference to the relevant documentation and factual material. The opinion is received not for the determination of any ultimate issue of liability but as probative of the risk which the Court must assess in determining whether to make an order under the section. These considerations are relevant to the admissibility of some of the affidavit evidence which has been relied upon in this case. 32 Specific objection has been taken on behalf of the second defendant to the use of transcripts of examinations conducted under s 19 of the ASIC Act. It was submitted that pursuant to s 68(3) of the ASIC Act such transcripts are not admissible in evidence against the person who has signed the record in a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty. It was submitted that the present proceedings are, in truth, proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. This is on the basis that if interlocutory in nature, then they are interlocutory in respect of proceedings not yet commenced but which will inevitably be penalty proceedings. 33 Accepting that there is a possibility that penalty proceedings may be taken against one or more of the defendants in this case that does not, in my opinion, render the present application an application for the imposition of a penalty or an application incidental to such proceeding. As already noted, evidence may be relied upon of a hearsay or opinion character in these proceedings which might not be admissible in penalty proceedings. The same is true for s 19 transcripts. 34 It was submitted for the second defendant that because ASIC seeks an order that the reasonable costs of the receivers and managers whose appointment it seeks should be payable from the collective assets of the defendants, that fact itself gives the present application the character of a penalty proceeding. In my opinion however, the submission is misconceived. An order for the payment of costs out of the collective assets of the defendants would not of itself amount to the imposition of a penalty. Although it may effectively deprive defendants of some of their property that imposition is not by way of punishment for any contravention of the law. 35 Objection was also taken to the admissibility against the second defendant of transcripts of examinations of other parties conducted under s 19 of the ASIC Act. In this respect s 77 of the ASIC Act was relied upon. That section provides: 'Where direct evidence by a person (the absent witness ) of a matter would be admissible in a proceeding, a statement that the absent witness made at an examination of the absent witness and that tends to establish that matter is admissible in the proceeding as evidence of that matter: (a) if it appears to the court or tribunal that: (i) the absent witness is dead or is unfit, because of physical or mental incapacity, to attend as a witness; or (ii) the absent witness is outside the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his or her attendance; or (iii) all reasonable steps have been taken to find the absent witness but he or she cannot be found; or (b) if it does not so appear to the court or tribunal unless another party to the proceeding requires the party tendering evidence of the statement to call the absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and the tendering party does not so call the absent witness.' It was submitted for the second defendant that ASIC has not adduced evidence in respect of the matters set out in s 77(a) and that therefore the s 19 transcripts of those parties that are not parties to the proceeding may only be tendered if the conditions set out in par (a) are set out. Counsel for ASIC on the other hand submitted that the second defendant had not required ASIC to call any absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and that therefore the condition of admissibility under s 77(b) of the Act was satisfied. Given the urgency with which the application has been made, it is perhaps a little unrealistic to require advance notice by the second defendant of the requirement that any absent witness whose s 19 transcript is relied upon be called as a witness in the proceeding. In my opinion, however, the transcripts of the examinations conducted under s 19 can be relied upon as tending to establish the possibility that circumstances exist which give rise to the necessity or desirability of a protective order. What is in evidence here is the fact that the statement was made in the course of a s 19 examination. The fact that the statement was made, rather like the hearsay evidence referred to earlier, may support an inference that circumstances exist that make a protective order necessary or desirable. It is not necessary to rely upon such evidence for the purpose of establishing the truth of the statement made."
Case39,considered,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561,"In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at 574 ("" Pegasus ""), Davies AJ addressed the question whether the sole director of the company which promoted and operated a managed investment scheme should also be considered to be a person operating the scheme. His Honour said at [55]-[57]: ""The word 'operate' is an ordinary word of the English language and, in the context, should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance. The term is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme. The Oxford English Dictionary gives these relevant meanings: 5. To effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work. 6. To cause or actuate the working of; to work (a machine, etc). Chiefly U.S. 7. To direct the working of; to manage, conduct, work (a railway, business, etc); to carry out or through, direct to an end (a principle, an undertaking, etc) orig. U.S. I have concluded that Mr McKim operated the managed investment scheme. He was the living person who formulated and directed the scheme and he was actively involved in its day to day operations. He supervised others in their performance. I have also concluded that Mr McKim is not exempted by s601ED(6). He did not 'merely' act as agent or employee of Pegasus. He was the directing mind and will of Pegasus and of the scheme."" 35 Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488. In that case, the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme. His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme, and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme. Accordingly, he was operating the scheme in contravention of s 601EB(5). In making these findings, Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred. 55 Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW ) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121, esp at 125, the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: see Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 at 603; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; and Pegasus at 571. ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act , and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects. The making of such a declaration does not simply record the outcome of enforcement proceedings; it may also be an appropriate way of marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 80 at 97-99, 106 and 110. 77 ASIC does not seek an order that BTS be wound up, even though there is some evidence that it might be insolvent. In many cases, it may be appropriate, and it may further investor protection, to make winding up orders in respect of both the unregistered managed investment scheme and the company which administered the scheme: see Pegasus at 579-580, at [95] [98]. Indeed, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778 at 796, Owen J said at [93] that if an unregistered scheme is to be wound up, the case for a liquidation of the company that conducted it is compelling."

Case49,cited,OD Transport Pty Ltd v WA Government Railways Commission (1987) 13 FCR 500,"Section 1324 permits the Court to grant an injunction ""on such terms as the court thinks appropriate"". These words echo the concluding words of s 80(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (""TPA"") which state that the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate. These words were introduced into s 80(1) by a 1983 amendment to the TPA, which, to adapt the language used by French J in OD Transport Pty Ltd v WA Government Railways Commission (1987) 13 FCR 500 at 508, freed the power conferred by s 80 from the previous constraint that the injunction granted under it must restrain a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of Part IV of Part V of the TPA or one of the species of accessorial participation there listed. 67 French J said that s 80 was a widely drawn remedial provision which was available to restrain conduct which may infringe upon the public interest by contravening the provisions of the TPA in Part IV and Part V. His Honour added at 268: ""There is room within the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence. That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court. The possibility remains open, by virtue of s 80(3) , that after a suitable period unmarked by further contravention the party restrained may apply to the court to rescind the order. The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act . This was a proper case for the grant of that relief."""

Lockhart J described s 80(1) as a public interest provision which attracts special considerations; it represents a primary means of ensuring compliance with commercial regulation legislation: at 254-255. After referring to subss 80(4) and (5), Lockhart J said: ""Injunctions are traditionally employed to restrain repetition of conduct. A statutory provision that enables an injunction to be granted to prevent the commission of conduct that has never been done before and is not likely to be done again is a statutory enlargement of traditional equitable principles. But this is because traditional doctrine surrounding the grant of injunctive relief was developed primarily for the protection of private proprietary rights. Public interest injunctions are different. Parts IV and V of the Act involve matters of high public policy. Parts IV and V relate to practices and conduct that legislatures throughout the world in different forms and to different degrees, have decided are contrary to the public interest (contracts, arrangements or understandings affecting competition adversely (s 45)), the misuse of market power (s 46) , the practice of exclusive dealing (s 47) , resale price maintenance (s 48) , price discrimination (s 49) , anti-competitive mergers (s 50) and unfair practices with respect to consumers (Pt V). These are legislative enactments of matters vital to the presence of free competition and enterprise and a just society."" In his Honour's view, the section would in an appropriate case authorise the Court to grant an injunction against a respondent preventing him in engaging in conduct which is similar to the conduct which constituted, or would constitute, a contravention of the Act : at 261. Lockhart J also agreed (at 261) with the reasoning of Barwick CJ in Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617 at 632 that in an appropriate case the court may grant an injunction to restrain the respondent from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance notwithstanding that only some of the acts falling within s 96(3) were found to have been so committed. 68 In ACCC v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197 at 202 at [D]-[E], after referring to these passages in ICI , Merkel J said: ""The width of the power conferred by s 80 and its public interest character obviously give the Court great amplitude in determining appropriate injunctive orders in a particular case.

Confinement of the power by reference to the scope and purpose of the TPA, and in particular s 80 , is one limitation on the power. However, there are at least two further limitations. The power to make orders under s 80 is only enlivened in a proceeding which alleges that there has been a contravention of a provision of Pt IV , IVA or V of the TPA. As was said by Gummow J in ICI at 267, the terms of an injunction granted under s 80 must, on their face, operate upon a range of conduct which has 'the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act . Irrespective of whether the injunction is sought or granted under s 80(1) or 80 (1AA) there must be a nexus between the conduct alleged or found to constitute the relevant contraventions and the injunctions granted."" 70 Most recently, in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 , a Full Court (comprising Ryan, Finn and Allsop JJ) noted the apparent tension between the view expressed by Lockhart and Gummow JJ in ICI . Their Honours said at [30]-[31]: ""His Honour's reference to terms having 'an operation outside the boundaries of s 80 ' is no more than a paraphrase of the actual words of the subsection 'such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.' That paraphrase, we consider with respect, does not illuminate the amplitude which should be given, as a matter of construction, to the grant of power. In our view, a more helpful guide to resolving the question of construction is afforded by this observation, also from ICI v Trade Practices Commission , of Lockhart J (with whom French J agreed) at 256; 'In my opinion subss (4) and (5) are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied (ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pt IV or V of the Act ), the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints, though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly.' This approach of Lochkhart J accords with the view often expressed by the High Court that discretions or powers entrusted to Courts should be read liberally for the relevant statutory purpose, without making implications or imposing limitations not found in the express words: Australian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270 at [77] and see generally for the cases Hewlett Packard v GE Capital [2003] FCAFC 256 ; (2003) 203 ALR 51 at [187] .""

There must, however, be a sufficient nexus or relationship between the conduct that is the subject of the restraint and the conduct that was alleged to constitute a contravention of the Act . As French J pointed out in ACCC v Real Estate Institute (WA) [1999] FCA 1387 ; (1999) 95 FCR 114 at 131, the question whether there is a sufficient nexus between the orders sought and the contraventions alleged involves an evaluative judgment by the Court which will depend heavily upon the circumstances of the particular case."
Case54,discussed,Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21,"Most recently, in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 , a Full Court (comprising Ryan, Finn and Allsop JJ) noted the apparent tension between the view expressed by Lockhart and Gummow JJ in ICI .

Thus, the Full Court preferred the wider view described by Lockhart and French JJ in ICI to the narrower view which the appellant in Foster sought to found upon the judgment of Gummow J. 71 The issue in Foster was whether an injunction that restrained the fourth respondent from being directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in the promotion or conduct of a business of a specified kind for a period of five years went beyond the power conferred by s 80 of the TPA. As the Full Court explained, this turned on the existence of a sufficient nexus between a contravention that enlivened the Court's power under s 80 and the conduct that was restrained by the injunction: ""In our view, the need, suggested by the authorities, for a nexus between the contravention of the Act which the Court has found and the terms of the restraint which it then decides to impose is a specific reflection of Lockhart J's insistence that the power be exercised 'judicially and sensibly'. It goes to the appropriateness of the relief contemplated by the concluding words of s 80(1) , not to the extent of the power to grant it. If the Court considers that a complete prohibition, whether permanently or for a specified period, on a respondent's engaging in a particular field of commercial activity or industry is required to protect the public from conduct of the kind which constituted the contravention, s 80 is wide enough to support such a prohibition as a matter of power. This analysis of s 80 conforms, we consider, with that recently undertaken by Goldberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 482 at 504 [110]."" The Full Court held that there was an appropriate nexus, as the evidence and the trial judge's findings at first instance gave rise to a real fear that the fourth respondent would, unless restrained, commit further conduct of the same general kind. In these circumstances, it was appropriate to cast the injunction more widely in order to catch conduct which was similar to the established contravention: at [34] and [38]. 72 In the present case, I consider that the wider form of injunctive relief is appropriate, especially given the evidence that McDougall attempted to resuscitate the Scheme in another form. The evidence demonstrates, in my view, that the defendants are susceptible to repeating their contraventions of the managed investment provisions of the Act . There is, in my opinion, a sufficient nexus between the wider form of injunctive order sought by ASIC in par 5 of the draft orders, and the contraventions of the Act which were established by the evidence in this case. The wider form of injunction is consented to by the defendants. In all the circumstances, I consider that the wider form of injunction is warranted, and that it will serve the public interest. 73 ASIC seeks orders that the Scheme be wound up pursuant to s 601EE(1) of the Act . A number of ancillary orders are sought, including an order appointing the existing Court appointed receivers as joint and several liquidators of the Scheme. The defendants consent to these orders being made. I have made two minor alterations to the form of the draft orders for the winding up of the Scheme. The first alteration, in par 7, identifies Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart as the receivers appointed by order of Merkel J on 25 October 2005. The second alteration clarifies that the receivers referred to in par 9 are the individuals identified in the above par 7 of the orders."

Indeed, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778 at 796, Owen J said at [93] that if an unregistered scheme is to be wound up, the case for a liquidation of the company that conducted it is compelling."
Case57,referred to,Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720,"It has been said that s 31A lowers the bar in terms of summary judgment applications. The operation of s 31A was considered by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720. I do not think it necessary to enter into the interesting questions of what the particular standard imposed by the new version of s 31A might be. This is because whatever the bar is, the current applications pass well beneath it. That is, I find that they are, despite their creativity, devoid of merit. It follows, in my opinion, that there should be orders under s 31A. That makes it unnecessary for me to consider the operation of Order 20 rule 5 or to consider the operation of Order 11 rule 16 in so far as the statement of claim is concerned. 40 Mr Gargan argued that s 31A was constitutionally invalid. Normally s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) would impose upon this Court an obligation not to proceed to deal with Mr Gargan's constitutional argument without adjourning the proceeding in order to allow the various Attorneys-General for the States and of the Commonwealth a chance to intervene. However, s 78B operates on constitutional matters. I do not think that a constitutional argument which is completely devoid of merit amounts to a constitutional matter within the meaning of those provisions. To make good that point, it is necessary to take account of what the argument is. 41 The argument is that s 31A operates to ""dictate"" to the Federal Court what the outcome of the case is. There may well have been an issue if s 31A had commanded the Court to dismiss a proceeding which had any of the qualities described in s 31A(1)(a) or (b). However, the plain text of s 31A is that the Court ""may"" give judgment. There is simply no room to argue whatever that s 31A operates as a dictation. Accordingly I reject that argument. The necessary consequence is that there must, on both notices of motion, be judgment for the first and second respondents under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)."

I should note for completeness that at [11] Hely J relied upon what Adams J had said in Gargan v Scott (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 27 October 2003) and I respectfully adopt what Adams J said at [4]. I do not think that the argument based upon s 13 has any substance whatsoever."
Case59,cited,Daemar v Industrial Commission (NSW) (1988) 12 NSWLR 45,"Mr Gargan also argued that he had an entitlement to the issue of orders in the nature of mandamus against the Official Trustee. There may be a question in my mind as to whether that kind of right is a right which would vest, or would be property which is capable of vesting, in the Official Trustee. There are decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal which indicate that the right to seek mandamus may be a right which vests in the trustee: cf. Daemer v Industrial Commission (NSW) (1988) 12 NSWLR 45 at 54. However, for present purposes, it is not necessary to explore that proposition. On any view, the duties which are capable of being litigated in a mandamus application are duties of a public kind. I do not think that even if the difficulties in s 86 could be overcome by Mr Gargan that the duty thereby created could be described as public duty. Accordingly, I do not think that a case for issue of orders in the nature of mandamus has any prospects of success. 38 It is then necessary to say a little bit about the nature of the applications which are currently before the court. The first is an application pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) . Section 31A of that Act provides: Summary judgment (1) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: (a) the first party is prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding. (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding. (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be: (a) hopeless; or (b) bound to fail; for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. (4) This section does not limit any powers that the Court has apart from this section."

Nothing in Gye v McIntyre [1991] HCA 60 ; (1991) 171 CLR 609 , in my opinion, provides any succour whatsoever to the notion that s 86 imposes affirmative duties. For that reason, I do not think that such a negligence claim, even if articulated, has prospects. In any event, the only real way the claim could currently be formulated would be pursuant to ss 178 and 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth)."

His Honour applied what had fallen from Carr, Finn and Sundberg JJ in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315 at [20] : The Court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made. If it so finds, then the Court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. That is, the Court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time when the sequestration order was made, but also those facts now known then to have existed. The Court excludes those facts which have occurred since the order was made. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not have been made: Re Frank; Ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396 ; Stankiewicz v Plata [2000] FCA 1185 at [19] ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23; Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCA 347.

Case64,referred to,Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24 ; (1996) 189 CLR 51,"Fourthly, Mr Gargan relied upon the proposition that the Australian Capital Territory Local Court was a State court and that through various procedural alterations to the jurisdictions of State courts over the last 20 years, they had become unfit receptacles for federal jurisdiction within the meaning of the High Court's decision in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24 ; (1996) 189 CLR 51 . This argument is without merit. The Local Court of the Australian Capital Territory is not a State court for the purposes of the doctrine in Kable . Even if it were, Mr Gargan did not point to any provisions of the kind at suit in Kable itself which might give rise to the suggested incompatibility. 24 Fifthly, Mr Gargan placed some reliance upon the Common Law Procedure Act 1899 (NSW) which, outside consent matters, gave a right to trial by jury. The short answer is that that Act has been replaced by the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). In any event, any application that Act may have had to Local Court proceedings in Canberra or to Federal Court proceedings before Hely J, remains even now, elusive. 25 Finally Mr Gargan relied upon the notion that he was pursuing a civil penalty within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). I do not think that argument has any substance. It follows that I do not think that any of the arguments launched against Hely's J sequestration order have any prospects of success."
Case65,referred to,Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 172,"As to the annulment of the 1994 bankruptcy, this Court has vested in it, by s 27 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy. The meaning of that expression has recently been considered by a Full Court of this Court in the decision of Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 172. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine the precise boundaries of the nature of jurisdiction in bankruptcy. It suffices to observe that an application to annul a bankruptcy pursuant to s 153B lies squarely within the heartland of that jurisdiction. 9 Section 153B provides: Annulment by Court (1) If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made or, in the case of a debtor's petition, that the petition ought not to have been presented or ought not to have been accepted by the Official Receiver, the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy. (2) In the case of a debtor's petition, the order may be made whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when the petition was presented. 10 It is apparent from a cursory reading of s 153B that there are two elements to it. The first is the satisfaction in the Court of the fact that a sequestration order ought not to have been made. The second is an exercise by the court of a discretionary power if that condition precedent is satisfied."
Case66,referred to,"Re Gargan; Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (unreported, FCA, Kiefel J, 23 August 1996)","As I understood his submissions, the central proposition was that whilst he accepted he had consented to the making of the sequestration order in 1994, he had done so in circumstances where he was na&iuml;ve about the operation of the legal system. His admission that the sequestration order had been by consent is recorded in the reasons of Kiefel J in Re Gargan; Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1996] FCA 685 (unreported, Kiefel J, 23 August 1996). Those proceedings involved an earlier attempt by Mr Gargan to annul the bankruptcy. 14 Her Honour recited an affidavit (at [21]) which had been filed by Mr Gargan and which recorded the fact that he no longer opposed the making of the sequestration order. I did not understand Mr Gargan to cavil with that in the course of argument but instead, as it were, he sought to admit and avoid. 15 Notwithstanding his, at times, ingenious submissions, I am not persuaded that the circumstances surrounding the making of the sequestration order in 1994 are such that I could now be satisfied that it ought not to have been made. It seems, therefore, that the power under s 153B to annul the 1994 bankruptcy does not arise. 16 Although it is unnecessary in those circumstances to consider the likely disposition of the exercise of the discretionary power thereby conferred if it had arisen, I should say for completeness, even if the power in s 153B had been enlivened, I would not have exercised the discretion in Mr Gargan's favour. This is because first, it is apparent and indeed accepted, that the sequestration order was not ultimately resisted. Whatever else one might say about that, it provides a powerful discretionary reason, 14 years later, not now to undo it. 17 Secondly and, perhaps, related to the first point, is the fact that there has now been an extensive delay of 14 years. Finally, there is, of course, the fact that a prior application has been made to annul this bankruptcy and has failed. In each of those circumstances, it seems to me that even construing the amended application and statement of claim in the most charitable of fashions, it simply could not be the case that a claim, now to be brought by Mr Gargan to annul the first bankruptcy, would have any prospects whatsoever. 42 The first and second respondents apply for indemnity costs orders in relation to the dismissal which I have just ordered. It seems to me that in the exercise of the costs discretion the following matters are pertinent. First, the current proceeding involves attempts to re-litigate a number of matters which Mr Gargan has extensively litigated in the past and unsuccessfully. Secondly, in relation to the annulment application, he has made at least one prior annulment application before Kiefel J and failed. Thirdly, he has sought to articulate an argument based upon s 86 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), which operation has been determined, to his knowledge, in a contrary way by the Full Court in Heinrich . 43 Finally, I take into account as a matter of overall impression, that this proceeding commenced by Mr Gargan, in common with a number of other proceedings commenced by him, involve what appear on their face sometimes to be engaging, if obscure, legal questions. However, those arguments are rarely thought through to their final conclusion, and despite Mr Gargan's protestation of having studied law for two years, seem to indicate a desire more to be involved in the disposition of clever legal arguments in court rather than any focused attention upon what the consequences of his actions might be in relation to the parties against whom he brings his proceedings. 44 I am particularly mindful of the fact that Mr Gargan is an undischarged bankrupt. The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) are, by and large, directed to preventing the bringing of proceedings of the current kind. Although Mr Gargan articulated various ways in which it might plausibly be thought in some obscure circumstances that the current applications might be brought, I have found that those attempts were wholly unsuccessful and meritless. It seems to me that it is appropriate to mark disapprobation of the bringing of these proceedings by the making of the costs orders sought.

Case67,referred to,Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066,"That operation of s 153B was confirmed by Flick J in this Court in Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066 at [32] and [33]. His Honour applied what had fallen from Carr, Finn and Sundberg JJ in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315 at [20] : The Court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made. If it so finds, then the Court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. That is, the Court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time when the sequestration order was made, but also those facts now known then to have existed. The Court excludes those facts which have occurred since the order was made. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not have been made: Re Frank; Ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396 ; Stankiewicz v Plata [2000] FCA 1185 at [19] ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23; Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCA 347.

However, I must look at the power here being exercised, which is not one of appointment, but of suspension and removal. Such powers may need to be exercised in a variety of circumstances, without there necessarily being any relevance in seeking the views of local Aboriginal communities, such as for instance if a particular inspector was considered no longer to be a fit and proper person. I do not accept that the input of the local Aboriginal community is of the same significance in circumstances of suspension or removal, or that consultation would be regarded as an essential or mandatory requirement to effect a suspension or removal.

Case75,applied,Laurence v Chief of Navy [2004] FCA 1535 ; (2004) 139 FCR 555,"The second matter is whether the Act confers a power to make, grant or issue such an instrument or merely confers a power on the Minister to make a decision which is to be evidenced in writing: see Laurence v Chief of Navy [2004] FCA 1535 ; (2004) 139 FCR 555. In that case, at 558, Wilcox J drew the following distinction in relation to the power in question: I see a conceptual distinction between a power to issue an instrument, which itself has an operative legal effect, and a power to make a statutory decision which is immediately operative but, in the interests of good administration, is thereafter recorded in writing. 28 However, even if I am wrong about this matter and the focus of s 21R is upon the document being the operative act of appointment, in my view, s 33(3) does not operate to constrain the type of power referred to in s 33(4) of the Acts Interpretation Act . In Laurence 139 FCR at 558, Wilcox J briefly discussed the distinction between the type of power referred to in s 33(3) and the type of power referred to in s 33(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act . He concluded that the two subsections referred to different types of power, and therefore operated exclusively of each other. This distinction is similarly applicable as between s 33(3) and 33 (4), the former relating to the general making, granting or issuing of an instrument, the latter relating to the making of an appointment. 29 Section 33(3) is an enabling provision, which may or may not need to be relied upon in any given circumstance. However, the other enabling provision is s 33(4). I cannot see any reason to conclude that s 33(3) operates to constrain the effect of s 33(4) in interpreting s 21R. In my view, therefore, s 33(4) authorised the respondent to suspend or remove each applicant in the circumstances of this case."

Case77,cited,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24,"It is well established that, in the absence of any express limitation in a statute, a consideration will be considered irrelevant only where there is ""in the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision-maker may legitimately have regard"": Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40 and the cases there cited. 34 I must focus upon the Act itself as a whole to determine whether there is some limitation on the power of the respondent. Whilst I am concerned with the interpretation of a Commonwealth Act, it must be recalled that I am concerned primarily with Pt IIA which deals with Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage. The Act envisages that the Commonwealth Minister may delegate his powers to a state minister, which has occurred in this case. In my view, the Act envisages that a delegation could be made to the respondent in respect of the power to appoint inspectors in relation to Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage, and envisages that the state minister be given the discretion to exercise the power in view of the specific needs in Victoria of Aboriginal cultural heritage. The question here is whether the Act imposes a limitation on the respondent so as to prevent him from adding the new criteria in considering the appointment suspension or removal of inspectors. If the new criteria are inconsistent with the scheme in respect of inspectors and s 21R, then putting aside any proposed legislation, taking into account the new criteria would necessarily be taking into account an irrelevant consideration. 35 The Act does not contain any express limitation on the exercise of the respondent's power to suspend and remove. As I have said, I accept that the Act gives prominence to the role of Aboriginal people in deciding what should occur in respect of areas and objects of importance to them. In appointing inspectors under s 21R, the respondent has an obligation to consult a local Aboriginal community, in an endeavour to appoint people with the appropriate expertise and knowledge, and to ascertain whether the person is able to perform the duties of an inspector. These criteria must be taken into account, but are not necessarily the only criteria to be applied. I do not regard these criteria as the exhaustive criteria to which the respondent may have regard. 36 Further, there is nothing which would defeat the purposes of the Act if no inspectors were appointed, or all inspectors were temporarily suspended, or even if they were all removed. Section 4 of the Act sets out its purposes, which purposes can obviously be fulfilled without the appointment of inspectors. The Act applies to areas and objects in Australia, not just to Victoria. Part IIA and the appointment of inspectors under the Act only applies to Victoria. Whilst the appointment of inspectors may further the purposes of the Act, they are not necessary for the implementation of such purposes generally. 37 The principal power given to an inspector is that conferred by s 21C; that is to make an emergency declaration. The Commonwealth Minister, the respondent, and any other delegates of the Commonwealth Minister or of the respondent may also exercise the power to make an emergency declaration, as may a magistrate (although only on application by a local Aboriginal community)."

Case81,cited,R v Anderson; Ex parte Ipec-Air Pty Ltd [1965] HCA 27 ; (1965) 113 CLR 177,"There are many instances where important and significant decisions need to be made, and full-time public servants or servants of the Crown are regarded as capable of exercising independent judgements in making such decisions. Without statutory permission, it is not to be assumed that a public servant or servant of the Crown in whom a statutory power has been reposed will follow orders given by a superior. In fact, if a public servant or servant of the Crown did not exercise for himself or herself a discretion given to him or her to exercise, then the decision made would be invalid: see, for e.g. R v Anderson; Ex parte Ipec-Air Pty Ltd [1965] HCA 27 ; (1965) 113 CLR 177 at 201-202. There is nothing in the nature of the powers to be exercised, the context of their exercise, or the character of the office of inspector which leads to the conclusion that the new criteria could not be applied to the appointment of an inspector. In this case I do not see that the appointment of a public servant, who otherwise satisfies the criteria in s 21R, is an appointment that would be contrary to the scheme of the Act as a whole, or Pt IIA dealing with Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage. 41 I observe that, to the extent it is relevant, at least nine of the inspectors must have been public servants who satisfied the new criteria before the suspension decision, having been appointed under the Act and having been presumably regarded as being able to fulfil the function of inspector. I make this observation in view of the fact that the suspension of nine inspectors was lifted because they already satisfied the new criteria to be applied by the respondent. 42 Therefore, in my view, putting aside any question of change of legislation, the new criteria could be applied under the Act in the appointment, suspension and removal of inspectors by the respondent."

That subsection provides that the procedure of the AAT is, subject to the AAT Act and the Regulations and any other enactment, within the discretion of the AAT. 30 There were only two real issues in the proceeding before Senior Member Kelly. The first was whether there were documents in the possession of CRS which were the subject of the applicant's request.

Case99,referred to,Australian Postal Corporation v Forgie and Another [2003] FCAFC 223 ; (2003) 130 FCR 279,"94(1) of the EMDG Act provides that the provisions of subsection (2) thereof apply if the requirements specified in ss 94(1)(a) and 94(1)(b) are satisfied. The fulfilment of the requirements in s 94(1)(b)(ii) is conditional upon the satisfaction of the CEO of Austrade, and such satisfaction is to be determined by the application of the Guidelines. Once a determination has been made that the requirements are met, s 94(2) then directs Austrade to treat the particulars of the previous owner as being those of the applicant. Such determination requires a judgment to be made by the CEO of Austrade. As was observed in Australian Postal Corporation v Forgie and Another [2003] FCAFC 223 ; (2003) 130 FCR 279 at [40] of a decision making process: ' [t] his intellectual process involves matters of judgment and degree' . That is, a decision is required. In the application of both s 94(1)(b)(i) and (ii) a value judgment must be made by the decision-maker. Under s 94(1)(b)(i) a decision is required to be made in respect of the question whether the new owner is carrying on the old business or a part thereof. It follows that there has been a decision made by Austrade in respect of which an appeal may lie to this Court pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act. Accordingly, the Court rejects the submission that the requirements of s 94(1) constitute jurisdictional facts, and that s 94(1)(b)(i) is capable of determination by objective facts."

Case106,cited,Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223,"The applicant contends that the Act does not apply to her and therefore the divestiture order is invalid because s 4(6)(a) is not a valid law of the Federal Parliament. In the alternative the applicant contends that if it is a valid law, nevertheless, the power in s 21A(4) was not engaged in this case because the requirements of s 25(1D) were not met and therefore the divestiture order is invalid. The applicant further contends that even if these two contentions fail, the divestiture order made by the respondent is invalid because, before it was made, the applicant was not accorded procedural fairness. In the further alternative, the applicant contends that the order is invalid because the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest within s 21A(4). In her application and statement of claim the applicant also contended that the divestiture order is invalid because the respondent applied a policy and did not genuinely consider the merits of the matter before him or because his decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense ( Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223). At the hearing of the application, those two submissions were abandoned. 25 In relation to the applicant's first contention, the contention may be dealt with by reference to the facts stated to this point.

Case107,cited,Burton v Mayor etc of London Borough of Camden [2000] UKHL 8 ; [2000] 2 AC 399,"In those circumstances, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the respondent's alternative submission that in 2004 there was an acquisition within s 21A(4) when the applicant's former husband transferred his interest in the property to the applicant, who then became the sole registered proprietor of the property. The submissions on this issue went no further than the question of whether or not there had been an 'acquisition' within s 21A(4) in 2004. The applicant submits that by reference to general concepts of real property law there was no acquisition in 2004 because the applicant, who was a joint tenant of the property, was already (ie, prior to becoming the sole registered proprietor) seised of the whole of the estate or interest: Bradbrook MacCallum and Moore, Australian Real Property Law (3 rd ed, 2002) 340 [10.02]. It has been said that a joint tenant cannot assign his or her interest but, rather, one of two joint tenants may enter into a transaction by way of release of the estate: Burton v Mayor etc of London Borough of Camden [2000] UKHL 8 ; [2000] 2 AC 399. In response to this submission of the applicant, the respondent referred to s 12A of the Act . That section relevantly provides: '(3) For the purposes of this Act , a person acquires an interest in Australian urban land even if: (a) the person acquires the interest jointly with another person or persons; (b) the person has previously acquired an interest in Australian urban land; or (c) the interest is an increase in the amount of an existing interest of the person in Australian urban land.' 74 I think there was an increase in the applicant's interest within the terms of s 12A(3)(c) when she became the sole registered proprietor of the property and therefore an 'acquisition' within the Act . 75 However, there are a number of further matters which arise once this conclusion is reached and these further matters were not the subject of detailed submissions. They are as follows: 1. The respondent was aware of the proposed acquisition in 2004 and, in fact, agreed to it taking place, although he did so on the applicant agreeing to sell the property and without the formal approval procedures prescribed by the Act being followed. 2. A question may arise as to whether the power to make an order requiring the applicant to dispose of the whole of the property is engaged, having regard to the particular interest acquired by the applicant in 2004. 3. The minute containing the recommendations adopted by the respondent makes it clear that it was the acquisition in 1995 which formed the basis of the order made by the respondent under s 21A(4). A question may arise as to whether, in those circumstances, the respondent's decision can only be considered by reference to that acquisition."

The applicant argued the matter by reference to those principles."
Case109,considered,Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576,"In Kioa , it was also made clear that an applicant entitled to natural justice is entitled to be told of adverse information obtained by the decision-maker from third parties and which he or she proposes to take into account and to be given the opportunity to respond to that information. Brennan J referred to the obligation and identified its limits in the following passage (at 628-629) (footnotes omitted): 'A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise: Kanda v Government of Malay ; Ridge v Baldwin per Lord Morris; De Verteuil v Knaggs . The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. Administrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made. Administrative decisions are not necessarily to be held invalid because the procedures of adversary litigation are not fully observed. As Lord Diplock observed in Bushell v Environment Secretary : ""To 'over-judicialise' the inquiry by insisting on observance of the procedures of a court of justice which professional lawyers alone are competent to operate effectively in the interests of their clients would not be fair."" Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made. It is not sufficient for the repository of the power to endeavour to shut information of that kind out of his mind and to reach a decision without reference to it. Information of that kind creates a real risk of prejudice, albeit subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision an opportunity to deal with the information. He will be neither consoled nor assured to be told that the prejudicial information was left out of account. The allegation in par 22 was apparently credible, relevant and damaging. The failure to give Mr Kioa an opportunity to deal with it before making an order that Mr and Mrs. Kioa be deported left a risk of prejudice which ought to have been removed. There was nothing in the circumstances of the case - neither in the administrative framework created by the Act nor in any need for secrecy or speed in making the decision - which would have made it unreasonable to have given Mr and Mrs Kioa that opportunity. The failure to give Mr Kioa that opportunity amounts to a non-observance of the principles of natural justice.' The principle referred to in this passage is well established and, for present purposes, needs no further elaboration (see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 (' Alphaone ') at 590-591. 100 The principles governing the applicant's third submission are relatively clear, although they can give rise to difficulties in terms of application. Ordinarily, a decision-maker is not required to invite comment from an applicant as to the decision-maker's provisional views or mental processes ( F Hoffman-La Roche and Co AG v Secretary for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 per Lord Diplock at 369). However, a decision-maker may be under an obligation to invite comment from an applicant on an adverse conclusion based on known material if that conclusion is not an obvious and natural conclusion from that material. In Alphaone , the Full Court of this Court (Northrop, Miles and French JJ) put the matter in the following way (at 591-592): 'Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.' 102 The principle was referred to in passing by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 219 [21] - [22] (footnotes omitted): 'Further, it does not readily appear how the principles of procedural fairness could be engaged in the manner contended for by the prosecutor. It may be accepted, as the prosecutor submitted, that his entitlement extended to the rebuttal of, and comment by way of submission upon, adverse material received by the decision-maker from other sources. That stops short of supporting a complaint of the nature essentially involved here of the ""pitch"" or ""balance"" in the statement of relevant considerations in the Submission. Further, as indicated above, there is no substance in any complaint of unfair or prejudicial ""lack of balance"". Reference was made by the prosecutor to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd . Nothing there said supports any different conclusion to that just expressed. The Full Court's statement of principle was as follow: ""Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.""' 103 Alphaone was also referred to in the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. That case raised a question as to whether the Refugee Review Tribunal had advised, or sufficiently advised, an applicant for review of matters it relied on in dismissing the application. The case turned on the obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the facts of the case. The Court did make some observations about what was said to be a dichotomy between an obligation to advise of adverse conclusions which have been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material, and the lack of an obligation to advise of a decision-maker's mental processes or provisional views. After referring to the passage in Alphaone set out in [100] above, the Court said (at [30], [31] and [32]) (footnotes omitted) : 'Particular attention was directed in argument in this Court, as it had been in the courts below, to the Tribunal's conclusion that the three identified elements of the appellant's story were not ""plausible"". Was that a conclusion ""which would not obviously be open on the known material""? Or was it no more than a part of the ""mental processes"" by which the Tribunal arrived at its decision? Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy. There are two reasons to exercise considerable care in approaching the problem in that way. First, it is far from clear that the two categories that are identified (conclusions not obviously open on the known material, and mental processes of decision-making) encompass all possible kinds of case that may fall for consideration. Secondly, there is a very real risk that focusing upon these two categories will distract attention from the fundamental principles that are engaged. In Alphaone the Full Court rightly said: ""It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material."" (emphasis added) The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited ""to give evidence and present arguments relating to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"". (emphasis added) The reference to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"" is important.' Towards the end of the reasons for judgment, the Court made the following observation (at [49]): 'Finally, even if the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are properly identified to the applicant, there may yet be cases which would yield to analysis in the terms identified by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone . It would neither be necessary nor appropriate to now foreclose that possibility.'"
Case110,cited,Conwest Global Communications Corporation v Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (1997) 147 ALR 509,"I am not prepared to infer that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. In the notice of the order dated 23 February 2005 ([7] above) the respondent states that he is satisfied that the acquisition 'is contrary to the national interest'. The minute refers to the provisions of s 21A(4) and to that part of the subsection which refers to the national interest. It is clear that it was a matter which was brought to the respondent's attention. It is true that in terms of the minute the particular matters relevant to the national interest are not clearly identified. Furthermore, the respondent did not give reasons for his decision and he did not give evidence. However, care needs to be exercised in this area because of the broad nature of the concept of the national interest. A court will be slow to interfere with a Minister's decision as to what is in the national interest on the ground that a matter not taken into account was relevant to the national interest or a matter taken into account was irrelevant to the national interest: Leisure Entertainment Pty Ltd v Willis (1996) 64 FCR 205 at 220; Conwest Global Communications Corporation v Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (1997) 147 ALR 509 at 525. A court will also be slow to interfere with a Minister's decision as to what is in the national interest under the guise of an argument that it should be inferred from the material before the decision-maker that he or she was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition was contrary to the national interest."
Case111,considered,Cunliffe v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 44 ; (1994) 182 CLR 272,"In Cunliffe v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 44 ; (1994) 182 CLR 272 (at 315-316) Brennan J (as he then was) made the following observations as to the aliens power (at 315-316) (footnotes omitted): 'The power to make laws with respect to aliens, unlike the majority of the powers conferred by s 51 of the Constitution , is not a power to make laws with respect to a function of government, a field of activity or a class of relationships: it is a power to make laws with respect to a class of persons. If, in its operation, a law affects a class of persons with respect to whom there is a power to make laws, the law may have the character of a law with respect to persons of that class. But it is neither necessary nor sufficient that the law should change, regulate or abolish the rights, duties, powers and privileges of the relevant class treated merely as members of the general public or of a substantially wider class than the class of persons who constitute the subject matter of the power. For example, a law which requires notification of symptoms of a disease after entry to Australia by aliens and citizens indifferently is not a law with respect to aliens though it may be a law with respect to quarantine. But if and to the extent that the law discriminates between the public at large and the relevant class of persons (whether textually or in its operation), there is an indicium that the law is a law with respect to persons of that class. That indicium may suffice to give the law the character of a law with respect to persons of that class and, if the discrimination is in a matter peculiarly significant to that class, the law will bear that character. In this respect, the aliens power is similar to the corporations power considered in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd . In that case, s 45D(1)(b)(i) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which protected the businesses of trading corporations was held to be supported by s 51(xx) of the Constitution as a law with respect to trading corporations.' 51 A narrower view of the aliens power has been taken on occasion (see Gaudron J in Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 57) but I am satisfied that the views expressed by Brennan J in Cunliffe v Commonwealth (supra) are the principles binding on me. The applicant argued the matter by reference to those principles."

Case113,cited,F Hoffman-La Roche and Co AG v Secretary for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295,"The principles governing the applicant's third submission are relatively clear, although they can give rise to difficulties in terms of application. Ordinarily, a decision-maker is not required to invite comment from an applicant as to the decision-maker's provisional views or mental processes ( F Hoffman-La Roche and Co AG v Secretary for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 per Lord Diplock at 369). However, a decision-maker may be under an obligation to invite comment from an applicant on an adverse conclusion based on known material if that conclusion is not an obvious and natural conclusion from that material. In Alphaone , the Full Court of this Court (Northrop, Miles and French JJ) put the matter in the following way (at 591-592): 'Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.'"
Case114,considered,Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550,"In Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 (' Kioa '), Mason J (as he then was) (at 582) referred to the fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice that, generally speaking, a person is entitled to know the case against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it. Brennan J (at 612-616) referred to the authorities to the effect that the content of the rules of natural justice will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, including the nature of the jurisdiction or power exercised and the statutory provisions governing its exercise. Brennan J considered whether there was an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that 'the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case' ( Russell v Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109 per Lord Tucker at 118). Brennan J said (at 615-616): 'Yet Tucker LJ said in Russell v Duke of Norfolk [179] , that there is an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that ""the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case "" . If his Lordship's view be right, it would be necessary to hold that if, in some circumstances, perhaps unusual circumstances, a power may need to be exercised peremptorily, no exercise of that power is conditioned on observance of the principles of natural justice. But it would be wrong to attribute to a legislature such an intention. Rather, the intention to be implied when the statute is silent is that observance of the principles of natural justice conditions the exercise of the power although in some circumstances the content of those principles may be diminished (even to nothingness) to avoid frustrating the purpose for which the power was conferred. Accepting that the content of the principles of natural justice can be reduced to nothingness by the circumstances in which a power is exercised, a presumption that observance of those principles conditions the exercise of the power is not necessarily excluded at least where, in the generality of cases in which the power is to be exercised, those principles would have a substantial content.' 99 In Kioa , it was also made clear that an applicant entitled to natural justice is entitled to be told of adverse information obtained by the decision-maker from third parties and which he or she proposes to take into account and to be given the opportunity to respond to that information. Brennan J referred to the obligation and identified its limits in the following passage (at 628-629) (footnotes omitted): 'A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise: Kanda v Government of Malay ; Ridge v Baldwin per Lord Morris; De Verteuil v Knaggs . The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. Administrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made. Administrative decisions are not necessarily to be held invalid because the procedures of adversary litigation are not fully observed. As Lord Diplock observed in Bushell v Environment Secretary : ""To 'over-judicialise' the inquiry by insisting on observance of the procedures of a court of justice which professional lawyers alone are competent to operate effectively in the interests of their clients would not be fair."" Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made. It is not sufficient for the repository of the power to endeavour to shut information of that kind out of his mind and to reach a decision without reference to it. Information of that kind creates a real risk of prejudice, albeit subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision an opportunity to deal with the information. He will be neither consoled nor assured to be told that the prejudicial information was left out of account. The allegation in par 22 was apparently credible, relevant and damaging. The failure to give Mr Kioa an opportunity to deal with it before making an order that Mr and Mrs. Kioa be deported left a risk of prejudice which ought to have been removed. There was nothing in the circumstances of the case - neither in the administrative framework created by the Act nor in any need for secrecy or speed in making the decision - which would have made it unreasonable to have given Mr and Mrs Kioa that opportunity. The failure to give Mr Kioa that opportunity amounts to a non-observance of the principles of natural justice.' The principle referred to in this passage is well established and, for present purposes, needs no further elaboration (see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 (' Alphaone ') at 590-591."
Case115,cited,Leisure Entertainment Pty Ltd v Willis (1996) 64 FCR 205,"I am not prepared to infer that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. In the notice of the order dated 23 February 2005 ([7] above) the respondent states that he is satisfied that the acquisition 'is contrary to the national interest'. The minute refers to the provisions of s 21A(4) and to that part of the subsection which refers to the national interest. It is clear that it was a matter which was brought to the respondent's attention. It is true that in terms of the minute the particular matters relevant to the national interest are not clearly identified. Furthermore, the respondent did not give reasons for his decision and he did not give evidence. However, care needs to be exercised in this area because of the broad nature of the concept of the national interest. A court will be slow to interfere with a Minister's decision as to what is in the national interest on the ground that a matter not taken into account was relevant to the national interest or a matter taken into account was irrelevant to the national interest: Leisure Entertainment Pty Ltd v Willis (1996) 64 FCR 205 at 220; Conwest Global Communications Corporation v Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (1997) 147 ALR 509 at 525. A court will also be slow to interfere with a Minister's decision as to what is in the national interest under the guise of an argument that it should be inferred from the material before the decision-maker that he or she was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition was contrary to the national interest."
Case116,considered,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Re, ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212","The principle was referred to in passing by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 219 [21] - [22] (footnotes omitted): 'Further, it does not readily appear how the principles of procedural fairness could be engaged in the manner contended for by the prosecutor. It may be accepted, as the prosecutor submitted, that his entitlement extended to the rebuttal of, and comment by way of submission upon, adverse material received by the decision-maker from other sources. That stops short of supporting a complaint of the nature essentially involved here of the ""pitch"" or ""balance"" in the statement of relevant considerations in the Submission. Further, as indicated above, there is no substance in any complaint of unfair or prejudicial ""lack of balance"". Reference was made by the prosecutor to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd . Nothing there said supports any different conclusion to that just expressed. The Full Court's statement of principle was as follow: ""Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests.

Case117,considered,Mutual Pools and Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 9 ; (1993) 179 CLR 155,"Certain laws have been held to fall outside s 51(xxxi) and within another supporting head of power. Examples include laws which impose a fine or penalty or laws effecting or authorising seizure of the property of enemy aliens or the condemnation of prize. The test for determining if a law falls outside the scope of s 51(xxxi) has been variously stated. In Mutual Pools and Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 9 ; (1994) 179 CLR 155 Brennan J said (at 179-180): 'Although s 51(xxxi) abstracts from other heads of power the power of acquisition which that paragraph itself confers, it does not thereby abstract the power to prescribe the means appropriate and adapted to the achievement of an objective falling within another head of power where the acquisition of property without just terms is a necessary or characteristic feature of the means prescribed. In each of the cases in which laws for the acquisition of property without the provision of just terms have been held valid, such an acquisition has been a necessary or characteristic feature of the means selected to achieve an objective within power, the means selected being appropriate and adapted to that end. Therefore a law which selects and enacts means of achieving a legitimate objective is not necessarily invalid because the means involve an acquisition of property without just terms. What is critical to validity is whether the means selected, involving an acquisition of property without just terms, are appropriate and adapted to the achievement of the objective. The absence of just terms is relevant to that question, but not conclusive. Where the absence of just terms enhances the appropriateness of the means selected to the achievement of the legitimate objective, the law which prescribes those means is likely to fall outside s 51(xxxi) and within another supporting head of power. If it were otherwise, the guarantee of just terms would impair by implication the Parliament's capacity to enact laws effective to fulfil the purposes for which its several legislative powers are conferred. It would be erroneous so to construe grants of legislative power as to fetter their exercise by implying that s 51(xxxi) precluded the enactment of laws under other heads of power where the laws involved an acquisition of property without just terms, even though laws of that kind are appropriate and adapted to the execution of those powers in the public interest.'"

Case119,distinguished,"Patterson, Re; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 291","The applicant submits that the question whether the Treasurer is satisfied that an acquisition is contrary to the national interest is a jurisdictional fact and that it is not made out if the matters the Treasurer took into account do not support a reasonable and rational conclusion to that effect. She referred to the reasons for judgment of Kirby J in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 291, in particular at 504-505 [338]. The reasons of Kirby J do seem to support the submission advanced by the applicant, but I would not apply them in this case. None of the other Justices in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (supra) took a similar approach. For example, Gaudron J, who did discuss the concept of national interest, decided the case on the basis that the Minister asked herself the wrong question (at 417-420 [74]-[82]). If there is a jurisdictional fact in this case it is not whether the acquisition is contrary to the national interest but, rather, whether the Treasurer was satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. A question of that nature would not turn, ordinarily at least, on the Court's conclusion as to whether the material before the Minister provided a reasonable or rational foundation for the conclusion reached by the Minister. 122 I reject the applicant's submission that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. 123 For these reasons I make the following orders: 1. An order in the nature of certiorari quashing the order made by the respondent on 23 February 2005 under s 21A(4) of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) ('the Act') and relating to the land known as 481 Esplanade, Grange, in the State of South Australia, being the said land comprised in File Plan 42, Allotment 6, Hundred: Yatala; Subdivision: Grange ('the property'). 2. An order in the nature of mandamus, requiring the respondent to exercise his discretion pursuant to s 21A(4) of the Act and relating to the property according to law."
Case120,cited,Pidoto v The State of Victoria [1943] HCA 37 ; (1943) 68 CLR 87,"I was referred to the authorities which have considered the circumstances in which a legislative provision which is partially invalid will be read down: Pidoto v The State of Victoria [1943] HCA 37 ; (1943) 68 CLR 87 per Latham CJ at 108-111; Victoria v The Commonwealth (supra) per Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 501-503. But for s 5A there might have been some difficulties in the way of reading down s 4(6)(a) so that it applied only to non-citizens not ordinarily resident in Australia. For example, there would be the difficulty of a law expressed in general terms and arguably no clear guide as to Parliament's intention as to an appropriate limitation. However, I do not think that those types of difficulties arise here, because by providing in s 5A what is in effect a statutory statement or definition of non-citizens who do and do not fall within the definition of natural persons caught by s 4(6)(a) the Federal Parliament has sufficiently revealed an intention that that subsection should operate in relation to non-citizens even if it is otherwise invalid. Section 4(6)(a) insofar as it applies to non-citizens is a valid exercise of the aliens power. 56 The applicant made reference to the Federal Parliament's power to make laws with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws (s 51(xxxi)). Initially, the applicant contended that ss 4(6) and 21A of the Act could not be justified by reference to this head of power because, first, the acquisition was not for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament had power to make laws, and secondly, the acquisition of property was not on just terms. At the hearing, counsel for the applicant said that he was prepared to concede for the purposes of the argument that if there was an acquisition of property it was on just terms. The respondent contends first that ss 4(6) and 21A stand outside the scope of s 51(xxxi) and, secondly, that in any event, there was no acquisition of property within the terms of s 51(xxxi). In my opinion, both of the respondent's submissions should be accepted."
Case121,considered,Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32 ; (1991) 172 CLR 501,"The scope of the external affairs power has been considered by the High Court in a number of recent decisions. Both parties referred extensively to the decisions in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32 ; (1991) 172 CLR 501 (' Polyukhovich ') and Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Case) [1995] HCA 45 ; (1995) 187 CLR 416 (' Victoria v The Commonwealth '). 30 In Polyukhovich , Dawson J said of the external affairs power (at 632): '[T]he power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word ""affairs"" is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word ""external"" is precise and is unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase ""external affairs"".' The reasons for judgment of the other Justices were to similar effect: Mason CJ at 528-531; Deane J at 599-603; Gaudron J at 695-696; McHugh J at 712-714. 31 In Victoria v The Commonwealth, Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said (at 485) (footnotes omitted): 'Of course the scope of the legislative power is not confined to the implementation of treaties. The modern doctrine as to the scope of the power conferred by s 51(xxix) was adopted in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth . Dawson J expressed the doctrine in these terms: ""[T]he power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word 'affairs' is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word 'external' is precise and is unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase 'external affairs'."" Similar statements of the doctrine are to be found in the reasons for judgment of other Justices: Mason CJ; Deane J; Gaudron J; and McHugh J. They must now be taken as representing the view of the Court.' 33 Gleeson CJ referred to the plaintiff's argument to the effect that the external affairs power was limited to a power to make laws with respect to relations between Australia and other countries. He said that to accept that argument would involve overruling the decision in Polyukhovich . Gleeson CJ held that Polyukhovich had been correctly decided and he said (at [10]) (footnotes omitted): 'For this argument to succeed, it would be necessary for the Court to depart from the decision in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth , and to decide that the construction placed upon s 51(xxix) by every member of the Court in that case was wrong. In my view, the Court, upon reconsideration, should hold that Polyukhovich was correctly decided insofar as the decision bears upon the question of construction that arises in this case. Insofar as the decision goes beyond that, and bears, for example, upon Ch III of the Constitution , it is not presently relevant and it is unnecessary and inappropriate to say anything further about it. There was a difference between the view of s 51(xxix) taken by Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J, Gaudron J and McHugh J, on the one hand, and the views of Brennan J and Toohey J on the other. That difference does not affect the point presently in issue. Polyukhovich held that the external affairs power covers, but is not limited to, the matter of Australia's relations with other countries. It also includes a power to make laws with respect to places, persons, matters or things outside the geographical limits of, that is, external to, Australia. That conclusion represents the current doctrine of the Court on the external affairs power, and should be maintained because it is correct.' 34 Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ said (at [30]) that the modern doctrine of the scope of the power was as expressed by Dawson J in Polyukhovich (at 632). 35 Kirby J identified what he considered to be a number of difficulties with the 'geographical externality principle' and therefore put it to one side. He decided the case by reference to whether the laws were laws with respect to a 'matter of international concern' [66]-[117]. 36 It is well established that the grant of legislative power with respect to external affairs, as with other heads of power, should be construed with all the generality that the words admit. 39 The statement by Dawson J in Polyukhovich refers, among other things, to persons outside the geographical limits of Australia. 40 Clearly, a person not ordinarily resident in Australia might come to Australia from time to time, but I do not think that that means the concept of not being ordinarily resident in Australia lacks an element of externality. To say that a person is not ordinarily resident in Australia means that ordinarily that person is outside the geographical limits of Australia. 41 It follows that one matter, namely, a person not ordinarily resident in Australia, is a matter geographically external to Australia and the other matter, namely, the acquisition of Australian urban land is a matter geographically internal to Australia. 42 The question which arises is whether s 21A(4) and s 4(6)(a) must relate only to matters external to the geographical limits of Australia in order to fall within the external affairs power. If so, this law would fail to meet that test because it only operates when conduct is carried out in Australia, namely, the acquisition of urban land in Australia. The applicant submitted that Polyukovich was authority for the proposition that to fall within the external affairs power a law must deal 'entirely' or 'wholly' with a place, person, matter or thing geographically external to Australia. She referred to the reasons for judgment of Dawson J (at 641) and Gaudron J (at 695). The law in Polyukovich did deal entirely or wholly with acts, matters and things geographically external to Australia and it was held to be within the external affairs power. Their Honours' observations are to be read in that context and they are not authority for the proposition that a law only falls within the external affairs power if it deals entirely or wholly with a place, person, matter or thing geographically external to Australia. 43 I do not think the mere fact that the law is only engaged if conduct occurs within Australia of itself disqualifies the law from being a law with respect to external affairs. There seems to be no reason to say that simply because the law also relates to conduct in Australia or produces a certain result or effect in Australia that it is not a law with respect to external affairs. I reject the applicant's submission that s 4(6)(a) is invalid because it does not deal entirely with places, persons, matters or things outside the geographical limits of Australia. 44 The applicant submits in the alternative that the relevant provisions are not a law with respect to external affairs because the element of geographical externality is insufficient and because the pith and substance of the relevant provisions is conduct in Australia. 45 The question raised by that submission is not an easy one. It requires a characterisation of the relevant provisions. In Polyukhovich , Deane J said (at 602): 'Whatever may have been the position before the emergence of Australia as a fully independent sovereign State, it should now be accepted that any law which can properly be characterized as a law with respect to any matter, thing or person occurring or situate outside Australia is a law with respect to ""External affairs"" for the purposes of s 51(xxix). In referring to "" a law with respect to any matter ... occurring ... outside Australia"" , I intend to include, among other things, what Jacobs J described (see above) as ""any matter or thing done or to be done or prohibited to be done outside the boundaries of the Commonwealth"". As has been mentioned, that broad view of the scope of the power conforms with settled principles of constitutional construction.' 46 The relevant provisions only operate in relation to a class of persons who are geographically external to Australia. I think this can be said even though the actual criterion is that the person is not ordinarily resident in Australia. They are the only persons affected by the relevant provisions. The location of the class of persons affected by the relevant provisions is an important characteristic of them, albeit that another feature of them is conduct within Australia, that is to say, the acquisition of Australian urban land. In my opinion, for the purposes of determining whether the relevant provisions are a law with respect to external affairs, it is sufficient that the relevant provisions apply only to a class of persons geographically external to Australia. 47 In my opinion, the relevant provisions are a valid exercise of the external affairs power."
Case122,applied,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"An effective notice not having been given, the second question is whether the operation of s 25(1D) is contingent upon the giving of an effective notice. The circumstances in which an act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power will invalidate that exercise were considered by the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-390 per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Their Honours said that the relevant question is not whether the condition is mandatory or directory, but whether, by reference to the language of the relevant provision or provisions and the scope and object of the statute as a whole, it was a purpose of the legislation to invalidate an act done in breach of the condition. 71 In my opinion, by reason of the terms of s 25 , the operation of s 25(1D) is contingent upon the giving of an effective notice. Section 25(1) provides that the section has effect where the Treasurer receives a notice. Section 25(1D) refers to 'advice' given under s 25(1B). The 'advice' is of a decision under s 25(1A) , and a decision under s 25(1A) relates to 'the acquisition ... specified in the notice' and the decision which may be made is that there is 'no objection to the proposal specified in the notice'. Furthermore, the offence of contravening a condition referred to in s 25(1C) is linked to the advice of a decision under s 25(1B). In my opinion, there was no effective decision and therefore advice within the provisions of s 25 because there was no proposal specified in a notice and there was no proposal specified in a notice because the purported notice was not effective for the purposes of s 25(1A). 72 As far as the acquisition which took place in 1995 is concerned, s 25(1D) did not operate as a bar to the respondent exercising the power in s 21A(4). It was the acquisition which took place in 1995 which was relied on by the respondent for the purposes of his decision to make the divestiture order."

Case126,cited,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63,"Alphaone was also referred to in the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. That case raised a question as to whether the Refugee Review Tribunal had advised, or sufficiently advised, an applicant for review of matters it relied on in dismissing the application. The case turned on the obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the facts of the case. The Court did make some observations about what was said to be a dichotomy between an obligation to advise of adverse conclusions which have been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material, and the lack of an obligation to advise of a decision-maker's mental processes or provisional views. After referring to the passage in Alphaone set out in [100] above, the Court said (at [30], [31] and [32]) (footnotes omitted) : 'Particular attention was directed in argument in this Court, as it had been in the courts below, to the Tribunal's conclusion that the three identified elements of the appellant's story were not ""plausible"". Was that a conclusion ""which would not obviously be open on the known material""? Or was it no more than a part of the ""mental processes"" by which the Tribunal arrived at its decision? Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy. There are two reasons to exercise considerable care in approaching the problem in that way. First, it is far from clear that the two categories that are identified (conclusions not obviously open on the known material, and mental processes of decision-making) encompass all possible kinds of case that may fall for consideration. Secondly, there is a very real risk that focusing upon these two categories will distract attention from the fundamental principles that are engaged. In Alphaone the Full Court rightly said: ""It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material."" (emphasis added) The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited ""to give evidence and present arguments relating to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"". (emphasis added) The reference to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"" is important.' Towards the end of the reasons for judgment, the Court made the following observation (at [49]): 'Finally, even if the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are properly identified to the applicant, there may yet be cases which would yield to analysis in the terms identified by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone . It would neither be necessary nor appropriate to now foreclose that possibility.'"

Case129,cited,Theophanous v Commonwealth of Australia [2006] HCA 18 ; (2006) 80 ALJR 886,"In Re Director of Public Prosecutions; Ex parte Lawler (1994) 179 CLR 271, Deane and Gaudron JJ said (at 285): 'It is not necessary to repeat what we say in Mutual Pools with respect to the effect of the words ""for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws"". However, it is necessary to elaborate a little on the phrase ""acquisition of property on just terms"". Because s 51(xxxi) operates as a constitutional guarantee, the words ""acquisition"" and ""property"" are to be construed liberally . However, the power conferred by s 51(xxxi) is one with respect to ""acquisition of property on just terms"". That phrase must be read in its entirety and, when so read, it indicates that s 51(xxxi) applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms. It is not concerned with laws in connexion with which ""just terms"" is an inconsistent or incongruous notion. Thus, it is not concerned with a law imposing a fine or penalty, including by way of forfeiture, or a law effecting or authorizing seizure of the property of enemy aliens or the condemnation of prize. Laws of that kind do not involve acquisitions that permit of just terms and, thus, they are not laws with respect to ""acquisition of property"", as that expression is used in s 51(xxxi). It follows that a law which effects or authorizes forfeiture of property in consequence of its use in the commission of an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth stands outside s 51(xxxi).' This passage from the reasons for judgment of Deane and Gaudron JJ was cited with approval by five Justices of the High Court in Theophanous v Commonwealth of Australia [2006] HCA 18 at [55] - [56] . 59 The Act controls the acquisition of property in Australia by a foreign corporation or a natural person not ordinarily resident in Australia. That control involves power to prohibit a proposed acquisition, to approve a proposed acquisition and, in relation to an acquisition which has taken place without approval, to require a person to dispose of the property acquired. It is difficult to see how the subject matter of the Act could be properly controlled or regulated without the power to make a divestiture order. 60 Having regard to the principles which I have identified, in my opinion ss 4(6) and 21A (4) stand outside the scope of s 51(xxxi)."

Both parties referred extensively to the decisions in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32 ; (1991) 172 CLR 501 (' Polyukhovich ') and Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Case) [1995] HCA 45 ; (1995) 187 CLR 416 (' Victoria v The Commonwealth '). 31 In Victoria v The Commonwealth, Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said (at 485) (footnotes omitted): 'Of course the scope of the legislative power is not confined to the implementation of treaties. The modern doctrine as to the scope of the power conferred by s 51(xxix) was adopted in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth . Dawson J expressed the doctrine in these terms: ""[T]he power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word 'affairs' is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word 'external' is precise and is unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase 'external affairs'.""

Case134,referred to,Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 44 FCR 194,"Mr Spencer submitted that he had sought on a number of occasions to suggest a reasonable basis upon which this proceeding could be settled, and that the ACCC had acted unreasonably in refusing to engage with him. He referred to Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201 where Hill J summarised the principles that would ordinarily apply with regard to costs when a proceeding has not gone to trial. His Honour said: ""These cases seem to me support the following propositions being made. (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order: Stratford [ J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley (No 2) [1969] 1 WLR 1547] and the SEQEB case [ South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission (unreported, Federal Court, 10 February 1989, Pincus J)] . (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits or, for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial: Stratford . This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them ( SEQEB ). (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation: cf Sunday Times Newspaper Co Ltd v McIntosh (1933) 33 SR (NSW) 371. (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted: cf Re Asiatic Electric Co Pty Ltd [1973] 1 NSWLR 603 at 606, a case which, however, depended upon the specific working of the statute under consideration."""
Case135,referred to,Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622,"Mr Spencer also drew attention to a similar statement of principle by McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 626. 19 Mr Spencer argued that he had at all times acted reasonably in relation to the complaint brought against him by the ACCC. When the matter was first drawn to his attention, by a letter dated 14 April 2003 setting out the ACCC's concerns, he had caused his solicitors to reply to that letter, on 20 May 2003, responding in detail to the allegations. On 11 June 2003, the ACCC had written to his solicitors, thanking them for his response. That letter went on to say: ""This office is currently assessing the information provided by you on behalf of your client. However, it is apparent a number of issues remain, therefore as soon as this office has completed its assessment of your response I will contact you to arrange a mutually suitable time to meet with you and your client to discuss this matter further."" 20 It appears from the correspondence that was tendered before me that, despite the suggestion that there would be a meeting between the ACCC and Mr Spencer to discuss the matter further, no such meeting took place. Instead, on 11 August 2004, Deacons, acting on behalf of the ACCC, wrote to Mr Spencer's solicitors informing them that the matter had now been ""fully investigated"" and that the ACCC had determined to pursue it further. The letter went on to say that a proceeding had been instituted in the Federal Court that day, and enclosed a copy of the application and statement of claim."
Case136,referred to,One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548,"The ACCC submitted that the principles governing the award of costs in cases where a matter does not proceed to a final hearing were correctly expounded by Burchett J in One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 at 553: ""In my opinion, it is important to draw a distinction between cases in which one party, after litigating for some time, effectively surrenders to the other, and cases where some supervening event or settlement so removes or modifies the subject of the dispute that, although it could not be said that one side has simply won, no issue remains between the parties except that of costs. In the former type of case, there will commonly be lacking any basis for an exercise of the Court's discretion otherwise than by an award of costs to the successful party. It is the latter type of case which more often creates problems, since there may be difficulty in discerning a clear reason why one party, rather than the other, should bear the costs. "" 15 The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J. Although in Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J made no mention of One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation , her Honour's discussion at [48]-[59], under the heading ""Futility"", deals helpfully with the second category of cases that his Honour identified. 32 In my view, this case falls squarely within the first category of case articulated by Burchett J in One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation .

Case137,referred to,Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 ; (2005) 146 FCR 37,"In broad terms, the Federal Court Rules provide that where a party discontinues proceedings without the leave of the Court, the discontinuing party is liable to pay costs, unless the Court orders otherwise: see O 22 r 2 and 3, and O 62 r 26(1). No such rule is provided for where a proceeding is discontinued with the leave of the Court, although the starting point in principle is that the discontinuing party should meet the costs of the respondent: see Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 ; (2005) 146 FCR 37 per Stone J at [44]. 10 However, the starting point in resolving the issue is this case, namely who should bear the costs when a proceeding has been resolved by the making of consent orders, must be to consider the extent to which the ACCC succeeded in obtaining the relief that was initially sought. In that regard, the position is clear. Mr Spencer consented to the making of declarations by the Court that a series of agreements entered into by Contact Plus constituted ""franchise agreements"" within the meaning of clause 4 of the Code. He also consented to the making of declarations that Contact Plus had contravened the Code and therefore s 51AD of the Act , by failing to provide disclosure documents, and by failing to receive written and signed statements by the franchisees, as required. In addition, he consented to the making of directions regarding the termination of these franchise agreements, and other breaches of the Code. 11 The Court also declared, by consent, that Contact Plus had engaged in conduct that contravened ss 52 and 53 (g) of the Act regarding the representations made concerning the licence fee of $60,000 and the right of a franchisee to an area that was exclusive to that franchisee. Mr Spencer was declared to have aided, abetted, counselled or procured these contraventions of the Act , and to have been directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, those contraventions. 12 A statement of agreed facts was appended to the consent orders that were sought. That statement contains findings of fact for the purposes of s 83 of the Act . 13 Finally, Mr Spencer agreed to injunctions in the terms sought, which would run for a period of three years from the date of the order made. He accepted orders that required him to provide each person with whom Contact Plus had entered into an agreement similar in terms to those of the franchise agreements that were the subject of this proceeding with a disclosure document that complied with the requirements of the Code, and a copy of the orders of the Court. 15 The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J. Although in Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J made no mention of One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation , her Honour's discussion at [48]-[59], under the heading ""Futility"", deals helpfully with the second category of cases that his Honour identified."

The alleged invention, so the argument went, citing Maugham J in Adelmann &amp; Ham Boiler Corporation v Llanrwst Foundry Co (1928) 45 RPC 413 at 420, was simply the application of a well known and well understood piece of mechanism to achieve an obvious advantage.

Similarly in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1996) 35 IPR 296 at 302 Drummond J held that where an equitable title had been converted into legal title by assignment, the assignor would have the right to an account of profits made by the infringers in the period up to the assignment and that the assignee alone would have the right to any profits made by the infringers after that date.

It says that the claims, in particular claim 1, are not limited to power saws but extend to all manner of power tools. They do not include ""essential features"" in the specification, viz the reciprocation frequency and stroke length ranges. They also refer to a ""plurality"" of positions whereas in fact there are only two. 34 Whatever may be the position in relation to claim 1, the claims from claim 3 onwards, and in particular the critical claim 6, are clearly confined to power saws."
Case143,cited,Foggin v Lacey (2003) 57 IPR 225,"The principles are stated by Gummow J in Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela [1990] FCA 372 ; (1990) 19 IPR 435 at 440, cited with approval by the Full Court in Foggin v Lacey (2003) 57 IPR 225 at [13]. Gummow J said: ...(i) first impressions are important in determining whether there is an infringement of a design, (ii) an obvious imitation is one which is not the same as the registered design but is a copy apparent to the eye notwithstanding slight differences, (iii) the question must be looked at as one of substance and by examining the essential features of the design, (iv) a closer correspondence between the registered design and the alleged infringing design is necessary to satisfy the test of obvious imitation than that of fraudulent imitation, (v) precise mathematical comparisons or matters of measurements or ratios, which form no part of the mental picture which the eye conveys to the brain of shape or configuration suggested by the design, are not to be applied as the test of infringement; appearance to the eye is the critical issue, and (vi) questions of infringement must not be determined by a narrow or overly technical approach in comparison between the design and the alleged infringement, lest the registration be sapped of its worth to the registered owner. 116 As the Full Court in Foggin noted, it is for the Court to rule on the meaning of the design and question of infringement as determined by reference to the eye of the consumer. 117 My first, and continuing, impression is that product B is significantly different in appearance from the Design. In particular the shank is quite different. What is in issue here is an everyday product. To the lay person this looks like a saw, obviously not a hand saw but one with some attachment in the shape of the shank. I regard this as more important than differences in angles and proportions. Put simply, the Design shows a saw blade with a shank; product B is a saw with a different sort of shank. 118 As might be expected experts on either side gave differing views. Professor Redmond thought that the dominant aspect of the Design was the blade and that product B was ""closely similar, such that it has the same appeal to the eye as the design in the (Design)"". He saw the shank as an ""attachment device"" but the saw blade was the ""core or crucial visual element"". The shank was ""peripheral"" or ""of less significance"". Nevertheless I think the ordinary consumer would see a panel saw blade as a piece of metal with teeth along the bottom and a sloping top. The shank is at one end, and thus is in a literal sense peripheral, but it is, and would be seen as, an integral and distinctive part of the article."

In final submissions only seven were relied on. The general comment can be made that although some of the devices could perhaps as a matter of physical possibility be used as a jigsaw there was no clear direction that this was their intended use. 45 This device was in evidence and is also described in the Bosch 1993/94 Catalogue. It is described as a ""multisaw"" and is pictured as being used in panel saw mode.

The invention is not for a method of holding a power saw; it is for a power saw capable of fulfilling different functions. As already explained, the (perhaps overly scientific) term ""vector"" is but a word used in describing these two functions.

Case151,cited,Nicaro Holdings Pty ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1990) 16 IPR 545,"It is not in dispute that GMCA has offered for sale and sold in Australia two allegedly infringing products, referred to in this case as T1 and T2.

Integer 1.8 it will be recalled is as follows (emphasis added): and wherein the handle is positioned such that a force applied thereto by the user in a first of the said plurality of positions comprises a major vector transmitted along a line of action extending substantially parallel to the line of linear reciprocation. Integer 1.9 is in the same terms save only that the word ""parallel"" is replaced by the word ""transverse"".

Case153,cited,Polyaire Pty Ltd v K-Aire Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287,"In Polyaire Pty Ltd v K-Aire Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287 the High Court considered the concept of fraudulent imitation under the 1906 Act. Their Honours held (at [36]) that in order to find a fraudulent imitation it was not necessary to show that the differences between alleged infringement and design had been made to disguise the copying. In this respect their Honours at [28] qualified the statement in Malleys Limited v J W Tomlin Pty Ltd [1961] HCA 77 ; (1961) 180 CLR 120 at 127. In Polyaire their Honours at [17] accepted the submission that the application of a ""fraudulent imitation"" requires that the application of the design be with knowledge of the existence of the registration and of the absence of consent to its use, or with reason to suspect those matters, and that the use of the design produces what is an ""imitation"" within the meaning of para (a) [of s 30(1)]. This... is the knowledge, belief or intent which renders the conduct fraudulent. In a footnote to that passage their Honours say: See as to the permissible inference by a jury of fraud against a party who ""wilfully shuts his eyes"" the judgment of Lord Esher MR in English and Scottish Mercantile Investment Co Ltd v Brunton [1892] 2 QB 700 at 707-708. 114 As the submissions of Black &amp; Decker appear to accept, the knowledge, belief or intent which does or does not render the conduct fraudulent is that of the Chinese manufacturer. It is the manufacturer who is said to have ""applied"" the Design outside Australia. I see no reason to disbelieve the evidence of Mr Coates. It seems inherently unlikely that the Chinese manufacturer had knowledge of the Australian Designs Act; still less that the Design was registered under it. There is no basis for finding that the manufacturer had reason to suspect such registration. The onus on Black &amp; Decker to establish fraudulent imitation has not been discharged."

Case155,cited,Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 6 E &amp; B 327,"However, s 127(1) is not mandatory. Section 127(4) provides that the section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document (including a deed). As to authority to execute, persons dealing with BDA, including BDI, were entitled to assume that the company's constitution had been complied with and that a director had been duly appointed and had authority to exercise the powers customarily performed by a director of a similar company: s 129(1) , (3), the statutory equivalent of the Rule in Turquand's Case ( Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 6 E &amp; B 327). Section 128(1) provides that a person is entitled to make the assumptions in s 129 and a person is not entitled to make an assumption under s 129 if they knew the assumption was incorrect. While there is no evidence in the present case as to the powers of a director of a similar company to BDA, the onus is on GMCA to establish the contrary. In any event, it seems inherently likely that a director of a company similar to BDA, a wholly owned subsidiary of an overseas company, would have authority to execute on the company's behalf a document of the kind executed by Ms Armstrong. A degree of informality is to be expected. The reality is that Ms Armstrong was not, in the time-honoured expression, engaged on a frolic of her own. 145 In relation to BDI, Mr Pratt was authorized, by virtue of his office, to execute the Deed. The Deed was clearly in the ordinary course of business of BDI in that it dealt with the licensing of intellectual property, which seems to have been BDI's only business. 146 Black &amp; Decker's case is that because the December 2006 Deed made the March 2006 letter of termination ""null and void ab initio"", the 1987 Agreement, as varied by the 2005 Deed, continued uninterrupted. As a consequence, BDA is to be treated as having the status of exclusive licensee from at least the date of the 2005 Deed (its case that such status existed from the 1987 Agreement has been rejected for the reasons already given)."

Similarly in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1996) 35 IPR 296 at 302 Drummond J held that where an equitable title had been converted into legal title by assignment, the assignor would have the right to an account of profits made by the infringers in the period up to the assignment and that the assignee alone would have the right to any profits made by the infringers after that date. Likewise, if an election were made for damages the assignee is the proper claimant for that relief, but only as from the date its equitable ownership became converted by registration into full legal and beneficial ownership of the patent."

So much was recognised by the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Austin J) in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commissioner v Rich &amp; Ors (2004) 49 ACSR 578 at [16], although his Honour went on to observe that there are broadly two approaches exhibited by the observations in the cases one generally in favour of the use of audiovisual absent any impediment telling against its use; and the other a more cautious approach requiring good reason to be shown before leave to give evidence by means of video-link was granted. At [19] his Honour observed: Apart from dealing with obvious practical matters such as comparative costs and the difficulty created by differences in time zones, the cases touch upon some recurring themes: the appropriateness of audiovisual facilities for centrally important evidence, the assessment of credit where evidence is given by audiovisual link, difficulties raised by the use of documents for cross-examination in audiovisual evidence, technological difficulties due to lapse of time between transmission and receipt of questions and answers, and difficulties posed by the use of audiovisual facilities where the cross-examination is lengthy. There are also comments on the general approach to be taken by the court to a proposal for evidence to be adduced using audiovisual facilities. I shall refer briefly to each of these matters."

I agree with these observations. They illustrate the point that the choice in every case cannot be determined solely by reference to general principles because it is the application of those principles to the facts and circumstances of the particular case which must determine the choice; in the circumstances of a particular case, a matter may point one way and in another case it may point another way. At the end of the day, the exercise of the discretion as to what is appropriate in a particular case will involve a balancing exercise as to what will best serve the administration of justice consistently with maintaining justice between the parties: see Giles CJ in Sunstate Airlines at [4]. The Present Case In the present case, I have come to the conclusion that I should decline to make the direction for the following primary reasons: (1) There is no evidence before me that the Cooling Off Witnesses are not prepared to come to Sydney for the hearing or, through illness or otherwise, are unable to come. I accept that they are not compellable, but 9 of the 12 are still employees of StoresOnline and as StoresOnline will be bearing the cost of all travel and accommodation for all Cooling Off Witnesses, there is no financial disincentive for them in coming. References to their losing commission income while travelling and during their short stay here carries little weight, if any, particularly as it could no doubt be adjusted in their favour, by StoresOnline treating it as a 'one week off', in the 'two weeks on'/'one week off' arrangement for Sales Staff deposed to by Mr Klotz. (2) In my view, the overall savings in cost, by taking the evidence of the Cooling Off Witnesses by video-link rather than having them come here to give their evidence viva voce , will be at best marginal and at worst more expensive. The savings deposed to by Mr Klotz are, in the scheme of things, not significant and do not take into account all the costs associated with and all the costs which will arise as a result of, recourse to a video-link. It will, as submitted by the ACCC, require the ACCC to have an agent or agents at the remote location or locations to assist in the identification of documents during the course of cross-examination; it will undoubtedly lengthen the time it takes to complete the cross-examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses each day will at best be a half day due to time zone differences with attendant increase in the costs incurred for the additional time of counsel and instructing solicitors; and it would be common ground that these latter costs would quickly absorb and overtake any savings as between travel and accommodation costs on the one hand and the direct cost of utilising videoconference facilities on the other. (3) Clearly there are issues of credit involved as between the evidence in chief embodied in the affidavits of the Cooling Off Witnesses and the evidence in chief embodied in the affidavits of the ACCC's witnesses who purchased StoresOnline packages at the relevant Workshops in Australia going to the factual issue of whether or not the purchasers of such packages were told, at any time up to and including the point of sale, about the 'cooling off period'. In my view, it is in the interests of maintenance of justice between the parties that that evidence, from both sides, be given in person. (4) It is also clear that the cross-examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses will go beyond their evidence in relation to the 'cooling off period' issue. They will also be cross-examined in relation to other allegations of breaches contained in the statement of claim, as well as on the systems and procedures in place with a view to ensuring compliance with the Undertaking. So understood, their evidence is, contrary to the submission of StoresOnline, centrally important to the outcome of the case. (5) The anticipated size of the Court Book suggests that the Cooling Off Witnesses will be taken to a large number of documents in the course of their cross-examination. I accept that the management of such a task can be effectively handled whilst utilising videoconference facilities albeit, as mentioned above, at an additional significant cost. At one level then, this consideration is central. But where, as here, issues of credit are involved, it impels a conclusion in favour of the evidence being given in person. There are other matters which I have weighed into the balancing exercise in reaching the conclusion I have, in addition to the primary matters referred to in [15] above. On their own, they are not critical. However, as part of the balancing exercise they are, in my view, relevant; for example, the Cooling Off Witnesses are all people who regularly travel, both domestically and internationally, for or on behalf of StoresOnline. While having them travel from the United States to Australia and return will involve them in some 15 hours of travel each way within a relatively short timeframe, this is something to which they are accustomed in the course of their duties. It could not be seen as imposing on them an unusual personal or physical burden. The motion must be dismissed with costs.

Case163,applied,Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1,"No stay is sought if the first and third applicants fail to provide the security. Rather, if I were to order that security be provided, the applicants contend that the notice of motion should be adjourned to the day after the security is required to be provided, or later in the day upon which the security is required to allow the respondents to make further submissions regarding any further orders, which may be appropriate if that security is not provided. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANTS 8 In response, Mr Perry on behalf of the applicants has submitted, in essence: 1. Neither the first nor the third applicant has sufficient assets to meet any potential costs order, nor are they able to satisfy any order for security for costs. Accordingly the threshold for the making of an order has been established consistently with the decision of the Full Court in these proceedings. 2. However the question before the Court is whether the Court should exercise its discretion in this matter, and the key issue in relation to the exercise of discretion is the delay in serving the notice of motion for the security for costs on the applicants. In particular: (a) the notice was served on Friday 3 November 2006, and no notice had been given previously as to an intention to bring such an application (b) the impact of the delay is to be considered in a relative way, that is by considering its potential impact upon the hearing itself (c) if an order is to be made it cannot be satisfied by 4.00 pm Friday 10 November 2006 (d) notwithstanding that the motion does not seek a stay, it would be an extraordinary result for security to be ordered without there being some consequence attached to a failure to provide it (e) if a more realistic timeframe is given for the provision of security, the trial ought not to commence until the expiry of that time. SECURITY FOR COSTS 9 The Court has discretion under s 56 of Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order an applicant to a proceeding to give security for costs, and, if security or further security is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court may order that the proceeding be dismissed (s 56(4)). As pointed out by the Full Court in Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 the discretion to make orders under s 56 must be exercised judicially, but that is the only relevant limitation (at 3). Although O 28 r 3 sets out matters the Court may take into account in considering an application for security for costs, this is not an exhaustive statement of the cases in which an order for security for costs can be made ( Bell Wholesale at 3). THE CASE BEFORE ME 10 In my view in the case before me, relevant factors to take into consideration are as follows: 1. The fact that the Full Court on 1 June 2006 has previously ordered the applicants to pay security for costs in this matter, following broad agreement that the amount of $150 000 would be appropriate security for the costs of the respondent parties to the primary proceeding at the end of the first day of the trial ( Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93 at [5] ). 2. I note the submissions of Mr McQuade that there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. In Bell Wholesale , the Full Court emphasised that it is for the party against whom security is sought to show the impecuniosity of those who stand behind the company or who will benefit from litigation. Although Mr Perry submitted that it would not be possible for the second applicant, who presumably will be funding the security for costs, to satisfy an order by tomorrow afternoon, there is no indication that the second applicant is impecunious or would be unable at all to satisfy an order by a later date. However: 3. The amount sought by way of security is substantial, namely $87 832, which, if I make the orders sought by the respondents, would need to be paid by tomorrow afternoon. This is a substantial sum to be raised and paid on such short notice. 4. The notice of motion has been filed in extreme proximity to the commencement of the trial without explanation. Indeed, the notice of motion was filed last Friday, mentioned on Monday and heard today in respect of an application for security for costs to be paid by tomorrow before a trial commences on Monday next. The fact that I can make reference to these days without dates illustrates the extreme tightness of the timing in the case before me. I note a similar matter which came before Toohey J in James v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 when an application for security for costs was made one month before the commencement of the trial. His Honour said in that case: 'It is well established that an application for security for costs should be made promptly... The matter is now so close to a hearing and so much time and costs have been expended that it would be a grave injustice to the applicants if they were ordered to provide security for costs when it is apparent that they cannot comply with such an order.' (at 446) 5. The November trial date of this matter has been known by all parties since late July 2006. At the directions hearing of 28 July 2006 I indicated to the parties the importance of compliance with Court directions in this matter and the need to be prepared for trial in November. As pointed out recently by Jessup J in Acohs Pty L Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1279 at [61] - [63] , citing authorities including Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308, it is an accepted principle in the ordering of security for costs that such an application should be made promptly. Although I know that the respondents did not file an application for security for costs until after it was clear that a mediated settlement of this matter would not take place, the success or otherwise of the mediation would not have prevented the respondents applying at an earlier date for security for costs of the trial, particularly if payment was sought to be made after the date by which medication was ordered to take place. While I note that the respondents had earlier sought and obtained an order for security for pre-trial costs, no satisfactory explanation has been provided as to why an application for security for trial costs has been brought on what is, in effect, the eve of the trial. 6. There have already been other significant delays in this matter in such respects as the hearing of the trial itself (adjourned from July 2006 to November 2006) and mediation of the matter (orders for which were made on 9 August 2006 for the mediation to take place by no later than 20 October 2006, but which did not occur until 2 November 2006). Obviously, as pointed out by the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, issues of case management do not take precedence over issues of justice. However, the fact that this case has already been characterised by significant delays is undesirable from the perspective of the parties and the Court, and there is an obvious risk that an order for security for costs which proves unrealistic for the applicants to comply with would delay the trial even further. 7. The respondents have sought no consequences as part of an order such as a stay in the event that security for costs are not paid before the commencement of the trial. As observed by Toohey J in James : 'Despite the submission of counsel for the first respondent, an order by way of security without a corresponding stay would be, in reality, no order at all, for no sanction would attach to non-compliance.' (at 446) 8. Although I said earlier in this judgment there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means, in cases where similar submissions have been successful (for example in Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1475 at [26] ) there were also no clear issues of delay or proximity to the hearing date as there are in this case. The issue here is not that there is a suggestion of impecuniosity of the second applicant, it is whether the delay in bringing the application for security for costs and the proximity of this application to the trial date militate against the exercise of my discretion to grant an order for security for costs in this case. 11 In my view, notwithstanding that the applicants have been ordered at an earlier date to pay security for pre-trial costs, the delays and the proximity to the hearing date of this application for trial costs in my view weigh against the exercise of a discretion in favour of the respondents in relation to this notice of motion."

Although I said earlier in this judgment there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means, in cases where similar submissions have been successful (for example in Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1475 at [26] ) there were also no clear issues of delay or proximity to the hearing date as there are in this case. The issue here is not that there is a suggestion of impecuniosity of the second applicant, it is whether the delay in bringing the application for security for costs and the proximity of this application to the trial date militate against the exercise of my discretion to grant an order for security for costs in this case. 11 In my view, notwithstanding that the applicants have been ordered at an earlier date to pay security for pre-trial costs, the delays and the proximity to the hearing date of this application for trial costs in my view weigh against the exercise of a discretion in favour of the respondents in relation to this notice of motion."
Case167,cited,State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146,"No stay is sought if the first and third applicants fail to provide the security. Rather, if I were to order that security be provided, the applicants contend that the notice of motion should be adjourned to the day after the security is required to be provided, or later in the day upon which the security is required to allow the respondents to make further submissions regarding any further orders, which may be appropriate if that security is not provided. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANTS 8 In response, Mr Perry on behalf of the applicants has submitted, in essence: 1. Neither the first nor the third applicant has sufficient assets to meet any potential costs order, nor are they able to satisfy any order for security for costs. Accordingly the threshold for the making of an order has been established consistently with the decision of the Full Court in these proceedings. 2. However the question before the Court is whether the Court should exercise its discretion in this matter, and the key issue in relation to the exercise of discretion is the delay in serving the notice of motion for the security for costs on the applicants. In particular: (a) the notice was served on Friday 3 November 2006, and no notice had been given previously as to an intention to bring such an application (b) the impact of the delay is to be considered in a relative way, that is by considering its potential impact upon the hearing itself (c) if an order is to be made it cannot be satisfied by 4.00 pm Friday 10 November 2006 (d) notwithstanding that the motion does not seek a stay, it would be an extraordinary result for security to be ordered without there being some consequence attached to a failure to provide it (e) if a more realistic timeframe is given for the provision of security, the trial ought not to commence until the expiry of that time. SECURITY FOR COSTS 9 The Court has discretion under s 56 of Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order an applicant to a proceeding to give security for costs, and, if security or further security is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court may order that the proceeding be dismissed (s 56(4)). As pointed out by the Full Court in Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 the discretion to make orders under s 56 must be exercised judicially, but that is the only relevant limitation (at 3). Although O 28 r 3 sets out matters the Court may take into account in considering an application for security for costs, this is not an exhaustive statement of the cases in which an order for security for costs can be made ( Bell Wholesale at 3). THE CASE BEFORE ME 10 In my view in the case before me, relevant factors to take into consideration are as follows: 1. The fact that the Full Court on 1 June 2006 has previously ordered the applicants to pay security for costs in this matter, following broad agreement that the amount of $150 000 would be appropriate security for the costs of the respondent parties to the primary proceeding at the end of the first day of the trial ( Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93 at [5] ). 2. I note the submissions of Mr McQuade that there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. In Bell Wholesale , the Full Court emphasised that it is for the party against whom security is sought to show the impecuniosity of those who stand behind the company or who will benefit from litigation. Although Mr Perry submitted that it would not be possible for the second applicant, who presumably will be funding the security for costs, to satisfy an order by tomorrow afternoon, there is no indication that the second applicant is impecunious or would be unable at all to satisfy an order by a later date. However: 3. The amount sought by way of security is substantial, namely $87 832, which, if I make the orders sought by the respondents, would need to be paid by tomorrow afternoon. This is a substantial sum to be raised and paid on such short notice. 4. The notice of motion has been filed in extreme proximity to the commencement of the trial without explanation. Indeed, the notice of motion was filed last Friday, mentioned on Monday and heard today in respect of an application for security for costs to be paid by tomorrow before a trial commences on Monday next. The fact that I can make reference to these days without dates illustrates the extreme tightness of the timing in the case before me. I note a similar matter which came before Toohey J in James v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 when an application for security for costs was made one month before the commencement of the trial. His Honour said in that case: 'It is well established that an application for security for costs should be made promptly... The matter is now so close to a hearing and so much time and costs have been expended that it would be a grave injustice to the applicants if they were ordered to provide security for costs when it is apparent that they cannot comply with such an order.' (at 446) 5. The November trial date of this matter has been known by all parties since late July 2006. At the directions hearing of 28 July 2006 I indicated to the parties the importance of compliance with Court directions in this matter and the need to be prepared for trial in November. As pointed out recently by Jessup J in Acohs Pty L Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1279 at [61] - [63] , citing authorities including Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308, it is an accepted principle in the ordering of security for costs that such an application should be made promptly. Although I know that the respondents did not file an application for security for costs until after it was clear that a mediated settlement of this matter would not take place, the success or otherwise of the mediation would not have prevented the respondents applying at an earlier date for security for costs of the trial, particularly if payment was sought to be made after the date by which medication was ordered to take place. While I note that the respondents had earlier sought and obtained an order for security for pre-trial costs, no satisfactory explanation has been provided as to why an application for security for trial costs has been brought on what is, in effect, the eve of the trial. 6. There have already been other significant delays in this matter in such respects as the hearing of the trial itself (adjourned from July 2006 to November 2006) and mediation of the matter (orders for which were made on 9 August 2006 for the mediation to take place by no later than 20 October 2006, but which did not occur until 2 November 2006). Obviously, as pointed out by the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, issues of case management do not take precedence over issues of justice. However, the fact that this case has already been characterised by significant delays is undesirable from the perspective of the parties and the Court, and there is an obvious risk that an order for security for costs which proves unrealistic for the applicants to comply with would delay the trial even further. 7. The respondents have sought no consequences as part of an order such as a stay in the event that security for costs are not paid before the commencement of the trial. As observed by Toohey J in James : 'Despite the submission of counsel for the first respondent, an order by way of security without a corresponding stay would be, in reality, no order at all, for no sanction would attach to non-compliance.' (at 446) 8. Although I said earlier in this judgment there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means, in cases where similar submissions have been successful (for example in Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1475 at [26] ) there were also no clear issues of delay or proximity to the hearing date as there are in this case.

Case168,cited,Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93,"The current position is that the Full Court on Thursday 1 June 2006 ordered that the first and third applicant provide security for the costs of the first and second respondent of the proceeding up to the end of the first day of the trial in the amount of $150 000 by way of unconditional bank guarantee in that sum or otherwise to the satisfaction of the District Registrar of the Queensland District Registry of the Court: Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93. I understand that security for costs was provided on Thursday 22 June 2006. 6 For the purposes of this judgment, I shall assume that the costs order of the Full Court was exhausted on Monday 17 July 2006 which was the first day of the trial, subsequently adjourned. 7 In his written submissions supplemented by oral submissions this morning in Court, Mr McQuade for the respondents submitted in summary as follows: 1. The sum sought by way of security for costs is referrable to the estimate of Mr James McLellan in his affidavit sworn 23 March 2006 and filed 27 March 2006. 2. Otherwise, the respondents rely on submissions and material previously before this Court and the Full Court. 3. The financial position of the first and third applicants is unchanged from April 2006. 4. There is no evidence that security would frustrate litigation and no evidence that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. 5. The onus is on the first and second applicants to raise impecuniosity of those whom litigation would benefit and to prove the facts upon which a contention is founded. 6. The trial will take two weeks. The parties are proposing to call 15 witnesses. 7. The respondents have not adduced any evidence that would weigh against an order for security. 8. There is evidence that the second applicant had an expectation of obtaining further funds to provide by way of security for costs. 9. There has been no delay by the respondents as to the notice of motion for security for costs. It was filed the day following an unsuccessful mediation between the parties. 11. No stay is sought if the first and third applicants fail to provide the security. Rather, if I were to order that security be provided, the applicants contend that the notice of motion should be adjourned to the day after the security is required to be provided, or later in the day upon which the security is required to allow the respondents to make further submissions regarding any further orders, which may be appropriate if that security is not provided.

Case170,applied,Brock v Minister for Home Affairs (2008) 170 FCR 434,"First, in my opinion, to relitigate the events of 27 March 2006 is an abuse of process and the pursuit of the claim for unlawful discrimination would involve a relitigation of the events of 27 March 2006. The Court has a wide jurisdiction to protect a party from an abuse of process constituted by an attempt to relitigate a case already disposed of: Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 392-393 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ. It seems clear on the authorities that a proceeding may constitute an abuse of process because it involves an attempt to relitigate a dispute already judicially determined even though none of the doctrines of res judicata , issue estoppel in the strict sense or an Anshun estoppel are made out: Coffey v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 375 ; (1999) 86 FCR 434 at 443 [25] ; Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 at [58] - [70] per French J; SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 168 FCR 410 at 423 [37]-[39] per French J (with whom Tracey J agreed at 437 [114]); Brock v Minister for Home Affairs (2008) 170 FCR 434 at 447 [74] per Lindgren and Tracey JJ. The claim for unlawful discrimination represents an attempt to relitigate the events of 27 March 2006 and is an abuse of process. I am mindful of the fact that, as events transpired, the claim for unlawful discrimination could not have been brought in the earlier proceeding, but that does not dissuade me from reaching the conclusion that I have expressed. The fact is that it was the applicant who decided to institute the earlier proceeding the day after the relevant events, to lodge his complaint with the Commission about three weeks after the relevant events, and to wait until 14 July 2006 before advising the Court that he had lodged a complaint with the Commission."
Case171,referred to,Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Taylor [2008] VSC 3,"An alternative ground for the conclusion that I should not disqualify myself from hearing the present application on the ground of apparent bias is this. The test for apparent bias is well-known and it is ""whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide"": Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 [11] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. In this case, if there is apparent bias, it takes the form of prejudgment. That form of bias was considered by the High Court in Livesey v The New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17 ; (1983) 151 CLR 288. In assessing that form of apparent bias in this case, the nature of the respondents' application is important. The respondents' application is not one in which I was called upon to make findings as to credit or, indeed, to make any findings of fact. The applicant's allegations of fact may be accepted for the purposes of the respondents' application. The questions raised by the respondents' application are, in substance, questions of law, and, having regard to all the circumstances, I do not think it can be said that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the question I am required to decide: Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 68 ATR 19 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Taylor [2008] VSC 3."

It seems clear on the authorities that a proceeding may constitute an abuse of process because it involves an attempt to relitigate a dispute already judicially determined even though none of the doctrines of res judicata , issue estoppel in the strict sense or an Anshun estoppel are made out: Coffey v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 375 ; (1999) 86 FCR 434 at 443 [25] ; Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 at [58] - [70] per French J; SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 168 FCR 410 at 423 [37]-[39] per French J (with whom Tracey J agreed at 437 [114]); Brock v Minister for Home Affairs (2008) 170 FCR 434 at 447 [74] per Lindgren and Tracey JJ. The claim for unlawful discrimination represents an attempt to relitigate the events of 27 March 2006 and is an abuse of process. I am mindful of the fact that, as events transpired, the claim for unlawful discrimination could not have been brought in the earlier proceeding, but that does not dissuade me from reaching the conclusion that I have expressed. The fact is that it was the applicant who decided to institute the earlier proceeding the day after the relevant events, to lodge his complaint with the Commission about three weeks after the relevant events, and to wait until 14 July 2006 before advising the Court that he had lodged a complaint with the Commission."
Case173,referred to,Cox v Journeaux (No 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713,"In Cox v Journeaux (No 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 , Dixon J (as his Honour then was) considered the meaning of personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt within s 63(3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924-1933 (Cth). His Honour applied Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd [1920] AC 102 and described (at 721) the relevant test in the following terms: The test appears to be whether the damages or part of them are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property."
Case174,referred to,Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488,"An alternative ground for the conclusion that I should not disqualify myself from hearing the present application on the ground of apparent bias is this. The test for apparent bias is well-known and it is ""whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide"": Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 [11] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. In this case, if there is apparent bias, it takes the form of prejudgment. That form of bias was considered by the High Court in Livesey v The New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17 ; (1983) 151 CLR 288. In assessing that form of apparent bias in this case, the nature of the respondents' application is important. The respondents' application is not one in which I was called upon to make findings as to credit or, indeed, to make any findings of fact. The applicant's allegations of fact may be accepted for the purposes of the respondents' application. The questions raised by the respondents' application are, in substance, questions of law, and, having regard to all the circumstances, I do not think it can be said that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the question I am required to decide: Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 68 ATR 19 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Taylor [2008] VSC 3."

Case176,applied,Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589,"Save and except for the alleged breaches of the deed of settlement (see the earlier judgment at [15]), all the causes of action in the present proceeding are different from those advanced in the earlier proceeding. Nevertheless, all the causes of action are based on the conduct of the second respondent acting for the first respondent on 27 March 2006 and its aftermath. The doctrine of res judicata may apply in relation to the cause of action in the present proceeding based on breaches of the deed of settlement but it does not apply to the other causes of action in the present proceeding. The doctrine of issue estoppel in the strict sense may apply to those causes of action, although it is difficult to be at all certain because of the lack of coherence in the applicant's pleadings in the present proceeding. The extended doctrine of issue estoppel as articulated in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 (""Anshun estoppel"") certainly applies in relation to all of the other claims and there is no reason they could not have been brought in the earlier proceeding. In the circumstances, the pursuit of the other claims is an abuse of process. 33 I turn now to consider the claim for unlawful discrimination. 34 In his amended statement of claim, the applicant alleges breaches or contraventions by the respondents of ss 5 , 6 , 22 and 24 of the DD Act . Section 22(1) plainly does not apply because, on any view, the alleged discrimination is not of a type which falls within the terms of that subsection. Subsection (2) provides: It is unlawful for an educational authority to discriminate against a student on the ground of the student's disability or a disability of any of the student's associates: (a) by denying the student access, or limiting the student's access, to any benefit provided by the educational authority; or (b) by expelling the student; or (c) by subjecting the student to any other detriment."
Case177,referred to,Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCAFC 188,"The applicant lodged an appeal against the order I made dismissing the proceeding but, on 4 December 2007, the Full Court of this Court dismissed the appeal and ordered that the appellant in the appeal pay the respondent's costs thereof: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCAFC 188. 12 The applicant then applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the orders made by the Full Court but, on 15 May 2008, that application was dismissed. 13 One other point to note about the earlier proceeding is this. Before the present proceeding was instituted, the applicant made a complaint about the respondent's conduct to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (""the Commission"") (as it then was). In the course of a directions hearing in the earlier proceeding held on 14 July 2006, I fixed 17 and 18 August 2006 for the trial of the earlier proceeding. Those dates were subsequently vacated and, as I have said, the proceeding was heard on 5 and 6 October 2006. The point to be made is that at the directions hearing held on 14 July 2006, the applicant said that he had a complaint of ""disability discrimination on the same fact by the University"". He said that the complaint had been lodged with the Commission. He said that the first respondent had asked for an extension of time to respond. The applicant raised the possibility of the proceeding then before the Court (that is, the earlier proceeding) being delayed so that it could be dealt with at the same time as any proceeding following the applicant's complaint to the Commission. In response, counsel for the first respondent said: Your Honour, we sought an extension of time from the Human Rights Commission. Perhaps we ought more properly have explained to them that these proceedings were on foot because, as I understand it, that would forestall the progression of any complaint stage in the Commission, and that is their policy, that is my understanding of their policy. The matter is only at the complaint stage; no proceedings have been issued. ... ... as I understand it the complaint stage needs to be worked through the Commission and examined by the Commissioner before formal proceedings are able to be initiated. We have undertaken mediation unsuccessfully. I think that the parties are some great difference apart in terms of the legal basis of the claim, but the mediation did crystallise some of the issues and we would seek that the matter be brought to trial as expeditiously as possible because we see that the trial is the only way to resolve those matters."
Case178,referred to,Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCA 816,"The trial of the earlier proceeding was held on 5 and 6 October 2006. On 31 May 2007, I made an order that the proceeding be dismissed and I delivered reasons for judgment: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCA 816. I will refer to those reasons as the earlier judgment. 9 One point to note, and the relevance of this will become apparent, is that in the course of the earlier judgment I said (at [4]) that I found the applicant ""a most unsatisfactory witness"" and that I did not accept his evidence except where it accorded with other evidence which I accepted. I said that the applicant's evidence as to important events changed during the course of the proceeding, that some of his evidence was highly improbable and a good deal of his evidence was inconsistent with evidence which I accepted."
Case179,referred to,Rana v University of South Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 941,"On 19 June 2007, I made an order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding on an indemnity basis: Rana v University of South Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 941. I said the following (at [6]): In my opinion, this is an appropriate case for the award of indemnity costs. Mr Rana made allegations about payment for the tickets and what occurred at the Convention Centre which were critical to his case and he must have known were untrue. Those allegations should not have been made. He claimed that he had suffered loss and damage of $1 million but he proved no loss or damage. He altered a document, namely, a receipt, so that his case would appear stronger. These circumstances alone justify an award of indemnity costs. A further and probably independent reason for awarding indemnity costs is that he refused an offer of $400 in relation to a claim which I dismissed. In all the circumstances, it is appropriate to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis."

Case185,referred to,SZARH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 615,"The appellant filed on 2 March 2004 an application in the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision. The appellant filed an amended application on 19 October 2004 which raised various grounds of review. The appellant claimed that the Tribunal overlooked some critical points of her case and did not address all the relevant issues she had raised, including whether she was considered a 'traitor' because of the anti-governmental views of her family. The appellant also claimed the Tribunal: failed to ask relevant questions, failed to determine whether the appellant was subject to persecution because of her imputed political opinion, failed to determine the 'particular social group' the applicant belonged to, and failed to enquire as to whether the appellant's past or future conduct would amount to persecution. The appellant also referred the Court below to the decision of SZARH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 615 , which was said by the appellant to raise similar issues to her proceedings currently before the Court. 10 The appellant's application below was heard on 22 May 2006, and a further submission was filed on 2 June 2006. Although the appellant did not seek leave to raise that further submission, the Federal Magistrate decided to consider the matters the subject thereof. That submission dealt in substance with the implications of the filing out of time of her application for review, and referred the Court below to judicial precedents purportedly supportive of the appellant's claims in that regard. 11 The Federal Magistrate was satisfied the appellant had established a reasonable excuse for the delay in bringing the application for review. In considering the appellant's substantive claims, the Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal did consider the aspects of the appellant's claims and that there was no evidence that any claim to the effect that the appellant was a 'traitor' was ever made to the Tribunal. The Federal Magistrate considered the appellant's contention that the Tribunal did not properly consider her claim to be a member of a particular social group. His Honour found this ground could not rightly stand, pointing out at [31] as follows: ""It is well established that a social group cannot be constituted by victims of crime, let alone potential victims of crime, which appears to be the applicant's claim. In any event, the nature of the particular social group claimed by the applicant in the submission was not put to the Tribunal, on the evidence before me"". 12 In line however with what I have observed at [8] above, the Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal did adequately address the issue of effectiveness of state protection in the Ukraine of persons such as the appellant. In relation to the authorities cited by the appellant, his Honour distinguished the same on the facts. The Federal Magistrate found that no case for jurisdictional error was made out and dismissed the application. 13 The Federal Magistrate was also of the opinion that there existed strong compassionate reasons based upon and referrable to humanitarian grounds, which relate largely to the circumstances of the appellant's age, single status and family circumstances. 14 The notice of appeal filed in the Federal Court raised the following grounds: that the Tribunal failed to assess the appellant's 'claims against proper information' and that the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal misunderstood the appellant's particular social group. 15 The appellant, by way of submissions dated 10 November 2006, submitted that the Tribunal assessed her claims against 'all women advanced in years and living alone in Ukraine'. The appellant contended that the Tribunal should have particularised her social group as 'aged, single women who had relatives overseas, who travelled overseas and who are considered as the ones who had money'. The appellant further submitted that had the Tribunal assessed her claims against that second particular social group, 'it would have no difficulty to accept that [her] claims are Convention-related because there would have been a great deal of independent information consistent with my claims'."
Case186,referred to,A pplicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387,"The Minister submitted that the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that a social group cannot be constituted by victims or potential victims of crime 'is consistent with authority that a social group cannot be defined merely by a shared fear of persecution'. In support of that proposition, the Minister referred to A pplicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 at [36] , where Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed as follows: '...the determination of whether a group falls within the definition of ""particular social group"" in Art 1A(2) of the Convention can be summarised as follows. First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group. Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution. Thirdly, the possession of that characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large. Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A (59), a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a ""social group"" and not a ""particular social group"". As this Court has repeatedly emphasised, identifying accurately the ""particular social group"" alleged is vital for the accurate application of the applicable law to the case in hand (60).'"
Case187,referred to,NABE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1,"Reiterating the reasoning of Scarlett FM, the Minister made the further submission that 'the Tribunal is not obliged to deal with a case not put to it or that does not clearly arise on the material before it', and that the 'social groups suggested by the appellant before His Honour were never put to the Tribunal'. The Minister referred to NABE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 in support of that contention. 20 After articulating the Minister's case with his usual precision, and pointing out why no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's reasons for decision could be distilled, in line of course with the Federal Magistrate's decision, counsel for the Minister concluded as follows: 'The social group that the appellant now suggests doesn't fall into either of those categories and, in any event, even leaving those two matters aside, the Tribunal's conclusions as to effective protection in the Ukraine would be another answer to them. Your Honour, plainly there are humanitarian aspects in this case. They were referred to by the learned Magistrate. I'm sure your Honour is fully cognisant of them, but all we can do is draw the remarks of the Magistrate and if your Honour makes any similar remarks, your Honour's remarks to the attention of the Department. Ultimately there is nothing more we can do because it's a matter purely for the Minister.' 21 I find the Minister's submissions persuasive and, consequently, find no error in the Tribunal's decision or that of the Federal Magistrate below. It is also my opinion that the observations made by counsel for the Minister were entirely apposite, and I would wholly endorse what he thus frankly and responsibly indicated. I would respectfully recommend to the Minister that there be a reconsideration of the evident plight of the appellant and the understandable concern and anxiety of her only close relatives, who now live in Australia as Australian citizens. The appellant's case is in my respectful view very strong on compassionate grounds, being an opinion in line with that of the Federal Magistrate below. 22 The appeal must be dismissed. I also make an order, nunc pro tunc, that the Refugee Review Tribunal, which was a party to the proceedings below, be joined as a respondent to the application. I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti. Associate: Dated: 30 January 2007 Appellant appeared in person Counsel for the Respondent: Mr T Reilly Solicitor for the Respondent: Blake Dawson Waldron Date of Hearing: 14 November 2006 Date of Judgment: 30 January 2007 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2007/32.html"
Case188,related,Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885,"application relates to a purported appeal from a decision of Mansfield J delivered on 21 December 2005 ( Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885). On 6 November 2006 I struck out the notice of appeal in ACD 4 of 2006 but granted leave to Mr Dunstan to re-plead by filing an amended notice of appeal on or before 2 February 2007, and the matter was stood over until today with costs reserved. I indicated to Mr Dunstan on that occasion that the notice of appeal simply did not comply with the Rules of Court in relation to the form and substance of such a document, and explained that it was fundamental that there be a notice of appeal in proper form. I then adverted to the fact that legal advice in a situation of this kind is very helpful, if not essential. I also mentioned the possibility of some pro bono assistance. I have given some consideration to that again but I do not think that it is appropriate to take any steps in relation to that. This is a very particular case which Mr Dunstan presented himself before the trial judge, and to bring anybody in to deal with this on a pro bono basis is, I think on reflection, not likely to be helpful."
Case189,affirmed,SZJXC v the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] FMCA 545,"This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse the appellant a protection visa. The nature of the appellant's protection visa application, the reasons of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate are set out in more detail in the Federal Magistrate's decision, SZJXC v the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] FMCA 545 , which is available on the internet. 2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China and his claim to be a refugee rests on an alleged fear of persecution based on his involvement in the practice of Falun Gong. 3 In his protection visa application he claimed to have been a member of Falun Gong since 1999. He said that after Falun Gong was banned by the authorities he would transport members for meetings and gatherings and provide emergency transportation. He claimed that in March 2005 while assisting the leader to escape from detention he was caught by police and held and interrogated for eight days and suffered ""serious mental and physical torment"". He claimed to have been forced to attend re-education classes and be supervised by what was called the 610 office.

Background 4 The facts are not in issue, the following being drawn largely from the applicant's submissions. 5 The applicant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on 2 June 1986. He first entered Australia on 23 April 1991 when he was 5 years old as a dependent of his father, who was employed with the Bangladesh Embassy in Canberra. On 27 April 2006 he lodged an application for a subclass 457 Business (Long stay) visa, as a dependent of his mother. 32 While judges of the High Court have questioned the actual suitability to private and non-curial proceedings, of the test for reasonably apprehended bias that has evolved in curial settings: see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [27] - [28] ; it is that ""double might"" test that is to be applied, albeit with the understanding that the hypothetical fair-minded lay observer in question requires some informed appreciation of the nature of the processes and proceeding of the body whose judgment is being called into question. The test to be applied is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal member might not have brought an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided: Ebner , at [6]."

Case192,applied,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507,"It is presently important to emphasise, as Hayne J did in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [184] that the development and application of the test of reasonable apprehension avoids the need for a court: ... to attempt some analysis of the likely or actual thought processes of the decision-maker. It objectifies what otherwise would be a wholly subjective inquiry and it poses the relevant question in a way that avoids having to predict what probably will be done, or to identify what probably was done, by the decision-maker in reaching the decision in question. 35 Because of the manner in which the case was originally put, it is appropriate to refer as well to the further observation of Hayne J in Jia Legeng (at [185]) that: Saying that a decision-maker has prejudged or will prejudge an issue, or even saying that there is a real likelihood that a reasonable observer might reach that conclusion, is to make a statement which has several distinct elements at its roots. First, there is the contention that the decision-maker has an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the particular case. Secondly, there is the contention that the decision-maker will apply that opinion to that matter in issue. Thirdly, there is the contention that the decision-maker will do so without giving the matter fresh consideration in the light of whatever may be the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. Most importantly, there is the assumption that the question which is said to have been prejudged is one which should be considered afresh in relation to the particular case. 41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four ""elements"" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above. Put in terms of those elements, it was contended that, first the Senior Member had on 30 May 2009 formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal; ie that the applicant had committed, or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed, a criminal offence on 1 May 2008. This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test. It was also relevant in addition by reason of para 1.10 of Direction No 21, as unresolved criminal charges as ""general conduct"", which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para 2.10 when considering whether it was likely to be repeated. Secondly , despite his protestations to the contrary, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible, relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend: cf Applicant VEAL of 2002 at [17]. Thirdly , it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21. 51 As with the Eastman case, I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive. While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four ""elements"" referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended, that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes. These are to maintain the integrity of the Tribunal's processes and procedures and to provide public reassurance of that integrity."
Case193,cited,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"Because, as will be seen, the application of this test in this matter does require an examination, amongst other things of the Tribunal's reasons, it is important to emphasise that the lay observer would be scrutinising those reasons through a quite different prism and by reference to a quite different contingency, than a judge would be when scrutinising a decision-maker's reasons for decision for the purpose of discerning an error justifying judicial review: cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272. To say this is not to accord the hypothetical observer licence to indulge in implausible or improbable interpretations of reasons for decision. The lay observer is expected first and foremost to be ""fair minded""."

Neither did the Tribunal member disclose that fact if he was then actually aware of it.

Case196,considered,R v Eastman (1994) 121 FLR 150,"The authorities most immediately relevant in a factual setting such as the present on the applicant's contentions are R v Eastman (1994) 121 FLR 150 and R v George (1987) 9 NSWLR 527. In each case, at some time prior to the criminal proceedings in question, the judge who respectively became the trial judge authorised the use of a listening device in relation to the person who was ( Eastman ), or subsequently became ( George ), the accused in the proceedings. In George the particular matter before the judge under the Listening Devices Act did not involve anything to do with the subject of the later charges. In Eastman the contrary was the case and, when the matter was drawn to his attention, the trial judge disqualified himself on the ground of reasonable apprehension of bias. As he said (at 153): What distinguishes this application from the application made in R v George is that the warrants were issued by me on the application of one or more police officers so as to facilitate the acquisition of evidence against the accused. In two instances the exercises were successful, because the Crown proposes to lead evidence of having installed listening devices under the authority of two warrants and the evidence thereby obtained. The ground for disqualifying myself is much stronger than that confronted by the trial judge in R v George . In George in contrast, an appeal challenging a conviction of the ground of apprehended bias was dismissed, the Court having regard to the nature of a criminal trial, the various activities in which judges may be involved in the administration of criminal justice and particularly ""to the absence of any association [of the listening device matter] with this particular case. (ii) Procedural Fairness 41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four ""elements"" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above. Put in terms of those elements, it was contended that, first the Senior Member had on 30 May 2009 formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal; ie that the applicant had committed, or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed, a criminal offence on 1 May 2008. This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test. It was also relevant in addition by reason of para 1.10 of Direction No 21, as unresolved criminal charges as ""general conduct"", which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para 2.10 when considering whether it was likely to be repeated. Secondly , despite his protestations to the contrary, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible, relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend: cf Applicant VEAL of 2002 at [17]. Thirdly , it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21. 43 In light of what was said by Gallop J in Eastman , the applicant contends as well that, having made a decision to issue a warrant which required him to form a view of the applicant's recent charge, the Tribunal member ought to have disqualified himself from hearing the subsequent application which required him to form a view of the applicant's conduct and whether he was likely to re-offend. 44 For my own part, I again emphasise that the test to be applied does not require analysis of the likely or actual thought processes of the Tribunal. There is no evidence as to whether, if at all prior to his decision the member recalled issuing the warrant involving Mr Islam. Such view as the lay observer might take on that matter, provided it is reasonable, may well be mistaken. That is not to the point. 45 The Tribunal did not disclose at the hearing its participation in the issue of the warrant. The member may well have had no memory of that. The member, equally, may have known or have become aware of that participation but have considered he could or should neutralise the significance of it by determining the matter without taking into account ""in any way"" the 1 May 2008 allegations. Alternatively and despite the significance to be attributed to ""general conduct"" at the stage of exercising the s 501(1) discretion (which could include ""unresolved charges pending a hearing"": Direction No 21, the member may have been of the view that account ought not be taken of the 1 May charge in any event as the applicant had not been convicted as charged. I express no view on any of these speculations other than to say that they would be contingencies which a fair minded lay observer could reasonably canvas in forming his or her judgment of the matter. 51 As with the Eastman case, I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive. While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four ""elements"" referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended, that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes. These are to maintain the integrity of the Tribunal's processes and procedures and to provide public reassurance of that integrity. 52 As Eastman illustrates, the potential is there for apparent compromise of an official's decision making whenever a close relationship or association exists between the subject matter of an administrative or judicial decision to be taken by that official, and adverse information obtained (or an adverse opinion formed) relating to that subject matter in the course of, or as a result of, a separate earlier decision taken by the same official for other purposes. Where it might reasonably be said that the having of (or having had) that information or opinion by virtue of a prior official decision might compromise the proper and impartial taking of the later decision, the same official ought not participate in the later decision. To do so would involve the member in the discharge, in the circumstances, of incompatible functions. Such was the case here. 53 It was inappropriate for the Tribunal member, having determined to authorise the issue of the warrant in relation to Mr Islam, to have then made the s 501(1) refusal determination given the association in subject matter of the two determinations or at least to have done so without the informed waiver of objection by Mr Islam to his so doing. Absent such waiver, I am satisfied that the ""double might"" test of the fair minded lay observer would inevitably be satisfied. 54 I have emphasised the complex of competing possible views, that the conduct of the Tribunal member, the course of the hearing and the Tribunal's decision, could reasonably engender in the lay observer. In my view, despite the Tribunal's and, for that matter, the Minister's disclaimers, such an observer could reasonably entertain an apprehension that the Tribunal's decision might have suffered from prejudgment. The closely associated decision-making that occurred here ought not be countenanced. The Tribunal should have procedures to guard against such a possibility."
Case197,cited,R v George (1987) 9 NSWLR 527,"The authorities most immediately relevant in a factual setting such as the present on the applicant's contentions are R v Eastman (1994) 121 FLR 150 and R v George (1987) 9 NSWLR 527.

(ii) Procedural Fairness"
Case198,cited,Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88,"It is unnecessary to refer separately here to the applicable principles other than to note, as I do below, the applicant's primary reliance on the decision of the High Court in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88. 39 As I earlier indicated, the two grounds of this application are that, first, the Tribunal's decision was affected by reasonably apprehended bias and, secondly, denial of procedural fairness. As to the latter ground, as formulated in the application it was that: 4.2.1 The issue of whether the applicant had committed a criminal offence on 1 May 2008 was credible, relevant and significant to the decision on whether or not to affirm the refusal of the visa. As such, the Tribunal was required, as a matter of procedural fairness, to give the applicant an opportunity to respond to information regarding the allegation that he had committed an offence on 1 May 2008. 4.2.3 During the hearing of the application before the Tribunal on 28 November 2008 the Tribunal repeatedly denied the applicant an opportunity to provide a detailed or adequate response to the allegation that he had committed an offence on 1 May 2008. 40 During the course of the hearing there was some movement in, and a coming together of, the grounds. This will become apparent in what follows. (a) Apprehended Bias 41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four ""elements"" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above. Put in terms of those elements, it was contended that, first the Senior Member had on 30 May 2009 formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal; ie that the applicant had committed, or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed, a criminal offence on 1 May 2008. This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test. It was also relevant in addition by reason of para 1.10 of Direction No 21, as unresolved criminal charges as ""general conduct"", which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para 2.10 when considering whether it was likely to be repeated. Secondly , despite his protestations to the contrary, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible, relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend: cf Applicant VEAL of 2002 at [17]. Thirdly , it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21. 49 On both of these issues the reasonable and fair minded lay observer could well consider he or she was being asked to, but was unable to, accept that the Tribunal could satisfactorily bifurcate the information it might possess on both those matters, and that it could reach its conclusion on each by reference, for example, to the three bail breaches while not taking into account in any way the view it had of the significance and character of the 1 May 2008 charge derived from the listening device hearing. While the significance of ""subconscious effect"" is to be treated with circumspection in procedural fairness cases given the relevant inquiry in such cases: cf Applicant VEAL at [19]; the issues of appearance and judgment in apprehended bias cases are, in my view, differently appointed. They do involve an appeal to the good sense and experience of the reasonably informed and fair minded lay (not judicial ) observer. 50 If the lay observer might experience some difficulty or reserve in accepting the potential efficacy of a self imposed ""Chinese wall"" in containing a prior formed opinion, that would well be compounded by the somewhat Delphic character of the Tribunal member's concluding comment on the November 2007 warning from the Minister about ""any further conduct bringing him within the provisions of s 501"": Unfortunately this warning appears to have not been taken seriously. 59 Unlike in Applicant VEAL both the Tribunal and the applicant were aware of the charge and of its being disregarded. As Mr Islam indicated when told it would be so treated ""I appreciate it"" it was to his advantage. What Mr Islam did not know and was not told, was of the member's participation in the issue of the warrant. The non-disclosure of that participation did not of itself raise a procedural fairness issue. It did set the scene, though, for the applicant's apprehended bias challenge. 60 I will order that: 1. The application be allowed. 2. The decision of the Tribunal be set aside. 3. The matter be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law. 4. The first respondent pay the applicant's costs of the application.

The Full Court stated (at 408, [25]): The effect of s 31A was to soften the test for a successful application for summary judgment as stated by the High Court in Theseus Exploration NL v Foyster [1972] HCA 41 ; (1972) 126 CLR 507 ... and also the test for a successful application for summary dismissal as stated by Dixon J, as his Honour then was, in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and by Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc v Cmr for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125....

Case203,followed,White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298,"effect noted and by reference to secondary materials, the Full Court counselled that ""a generally cautious approach should still be adopted to the exercise of the court's powers under s 31A"" (at 408, [28]). The Full Court particularly endorsed an observation concerning s 31A made by Lindgren J in White Australia Industries Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at 310, [50] that the section is concerned with ""the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings, with substance, not just with form"". Section 31A consigns to the Court a discretion as to whether the questions of law raised in a case are of such difficulty as to make it preferable not to resolve them summarily. It was not submitted that this was such a case in relation to issues related to the NTA. Rather, each of the parties invited the determination of them insofar as pertinent to the respondents' summary judgment application. In the event that I concluded that there was jurisdiction and standing, I was not asked to determine either summarily or as a separate question of law the merits of the State law issue as to the ability now of officers of the State under the Petroleum Act to grant petroleum leases on the strength of ATP 259P. For the purpose of the summary judgment application, the parties assumed that the factual foundation of the Applicants' case was as alleged in the amended statement of claim. I have done likewise."
Case204,applied,The Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2001] FCA 414 ; (2001) 108 FCR 453,"submission of Santos, Delhi Petroleum and the State that the application has no reasonable prospects of success is, in summary: (a) the Applicants do not seek a determination of native title in the present proceeding; (b) the definition of ""future act"" in s 233(1) of the NTA is that it is an act which, apart from the NTA, either validly affects (in the sense that word is to be understood in light of in s 227 of the NTA) native title in relation to the land or would, if valid, affect native title; (c) in light of Full Court's judgment in The Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2001] FCA 414 ; (2001) 108 FCR 453 ( Lardil ), to secure final relief of the kind sought by the Applicants it is not sufficient to establish only that an act might affect native title if native title were found to exist; (d) a corollary of this is that mere status as a registered native title claimant can never supply the requisite element in the definition of future act, which is also an element in any entitlement to the relief sought. The Applicants, in summary, make the following submission in response: (a) Lardil is distinguishable because it related to procedural rights conferred by s 24HA and s 24NA of the NTA and not the right to negotiate under Subdiv P of Div 2 of Pt 3 of that Act; (b) in any event, the declaration that the grant of a petroleum lease would not constitute a pre-existing rights based act does not require the Applicants to establish that they have native title because, if there is no valid ATP, it necessarily follows that there could be no valid grant of a petroleum lease. The latter submission entails some exploration of the ability of this Court to make any pronouncement in relation to the validity of an administrative actions arising only under State law. That is best considered in conjunction with the separate, jurisdictional challenge which Santos and Delhi Petroleum make. Lardil is not distinguishable. To the contrary, that case confirms, in a binding way, what a reading of the definition of ""future act"" in s 233 of the NTA would in any event suggest. That is, materially, that a future act is one which ""affects"" native title, not an act which, if native title existed, ""might"" affect it. To construe the definition in the latter way would, as French J (as the Chief Justice then was) observed in Lardil (at 473, [59]), ""require a re-writing of the statutory definition in s 233 which would significantly alter the operation of the act. Such a course is not justified by the language of a statute"". Similar sentiments are evident in the judgments of the other members of the Full Court in Lardil see p 476, [70] per Merkel J and p 486, [114] per Dowsett J. The ""right to negotiate"" claimed by the Applicants forms part (Subdiv P) of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA. Regard to the overview of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA, offered by s 24AA, also exposes the flaw in the Applicants' position. Thus, s 24AA(1) accurately informs the reader that Div 3 ""deals mainly with future acts, which are defined in s 233"" and that, "" Acts that do not affect native title are not future acts; therefore this Division does not deal with them "" (emphasis added). In turn, s 24AA(2) of the NTA offers the accurate general observation that, ""to the extent that a future act affects native title, it will be valid if covered by certain provisions of the Division, and invalid if not"". These general propositions, evident from the overview of Div 3, are expressly articulated in s 24OA of the NTA, which provides: 24OA Future acts invalid unless otherwise provided. Unless a provision of this Act provides otherwise, a future act is invalid to the extent that it affects native title. This section does not attend with invalidity a future act which might affect native title, were the same to exist. As in Lardil , the relief sought by the Applicants is final relief in a proceeding where no claim for native title is advanced. They rely on their status as the ""registered native title claimant"". Yet the advancing and successful vindication of a native title claim, not status as the ""registered native title claimant"", is, given the definition of ""future act"", just as central to the application of provisions upon which the Applicants rely as it was to those under consideration in Lardil . To seek to distinguish Lardil on the basis that the rights within Div 3 of Pt 2 with which that case was concerned were ""procedural rights"" ignores this centrality. For the purposes of s 31A of the FCA Act the Respondents have established that the Applicants have no reasonable prospect of securing any of the declaratory and injunctive relief which they seek, insofar as they rely on other than State law for any part of that relief. Jurisdiction &amp; Standing Section 81 of the NTA confers on the Court jurisdiction to hear and determine applications that ""relate to native title"". Read in isolation and as a matter of first impression and language, the jurisdiction conferred by this section appears to require nothing more or less than a relevant connection between the subject matter of an application and native title. In Lardil though (108 FCR at [156] and [68]), the conclusion was reached, after a consideration of the context in which s 81 appears in the NTA, that the section confers jurisdiction only in respect of applications under Pt 3 of that Act. This is not such an application. Perhaps recognising this, the Applicants did not point to s 81 as a source of jurisdiction to entertain their application. Instead, they adverted to s 213(2) of the NTA, to s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (Judiciary Act) and to s 21 of the FCA Act. Subject to the operation and effect of the other provisions of the NTA, s 213(2) confers jurisdiction on the Court ""in relation to matters arising under the Act"". For its part, s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act confers jurisdiction with respect to ""matters arising under any laws made by the Parliament"". The reference to s 21 of the FCA Act as a source of jurisdiction is misconceived. That section operates where some other provision has conferred original jurisdiction on the Court and, in such circumstances, empowers the Court to ""make binding declarations of right, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed"". In other words, s 21 is a source of power, not jurisdiction. Common to each of s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act and s 213(2) of the NTA is that the jurisdiction they confer is confined to the ""matters"" which those sections respectively specify. No point was taken in Lardil as to the absence in that case of a ""matter"". In the present case the amended statement of claim contains the following allegations: The applicants on behalf of the Wongkumara People are the registered native title claimant within the meaning of s 253 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NTA) in respect of land in south-west Queensland and north-west New South Wales, which land (""the Claimed Land"") is more particularly described in attachment B to Native Title Determination Application QUD52 of 2008 (as amended by leave granted by Dowsett J on 12 April 2008). The first respondent and third respondent are recorded in the register kept under s 80A of the Petroleum Act 1923 (Qld) (the Petroleum Act ) as the holder of an Authority to Prospect (ATP) 259P dated 31 January 1979 pursuant to the Petroleum Act in respect of land in south-west Queensland (the ATP Land), which land lies wholly within the boundaries of the Claimed Land. The second respondent is a Government party within the meaning of s 26(1) of the NTA for lands and water within the state of Queensland. 3A. Since the grant of ATP 259P the first and third respondents have prospected and continue to prospect for petroleum on the ATP Land including the Claimed Land. From about late 2005, representatives of the Wongkumara People and of the first respondent on behalf of the itself and the third respondent and other companies being joint venture partners of the first and third respondents have been engaged in negotiations for an indigenous land use agreement (""the proposed ILUA"") under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (NTA), which negotiations relate, inter alia, to proposed future acts under the NTA in respect of the Claimed Land covered by the ATP. 4A. The proposed ILUA is to replace an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (""the former ILUA"") that was part of an Implementation Agreement dated 16 January 2001 and which was in force for a term of five years. 4B. The former ILUA was never registered under the NTA. In the course of negotiations for the former ILUA and for the proposed ILUA the first respondent on behalf of itself and its joint venture partners has claimed that because ATP 259P predates the NTA and the grant of a petroleum lease under the Petroleum Act is a pre-existing rights based act (PERBA) within the meaning of Subdivision I of Division 3 of Part 2 of the NTA and as such is not subject to the right to negotiate provisions of Subdivision P of Division 3 of Part 2 of the NTA and should not be part of the negotiations for the proposed ILUA. Particulars Clause 9.4 of the former ILUA Letter dated 4 November 2005 from the first respondent to representatives of the Wongkumara People. The applicants have maintained that they are entitled to the right to negotiate under the NTA in respect of the grant of petroleum lease over the Claimed Land covered by the ATP and that the grant of a petroleum lease should be part of the negotiations for the proposed ILUA. Particulars Clause 9.4 of the former ILUA Letter dated 18 June 2008 from Eddy Neumann Lawyers, solicitors for the applicant, to the first respondent. ATP 259P was originally issued on 31 January 1979 for a term of four years commencing n 1 January 1979. From time to time thereafter, the term of ATP 259P has purportedly been varied, extended or renewed. Particulars (a) 22 December 1982: variation by which the term was renewed for four years commencing on 1 January 1983. (b) 18 December 1986: variation by which the term was extended for four years commencing on 1 January 1987. (c) 7 May 1991: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1991. (d) 20 September 1995: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1995. (e) 24 June 1999: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1999. (f) 12 December 2003: variation by which the term of the ATP was extended for four years commencing on 1 January 2003. (g) 3 January 2008: renewal by which the term of the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing January 2007. Read with the relief sought by the Applicants, the amended statement of claim offers, in my opinion, a paradigm example of an impermissible attempt to secure an advisory opinion. What is revealed is nothing more than a difference in contractual negotiating positions between the Applicants, who claim in other proceedings, but have not yet been determined to hold, native title in respect of the claimed land and Santos and Delhi Petroleum who may one day seek to obtain from the State a petroleum lease in respect over part of the claimed land on the strength of ATP259P. It is not pleaded that any such lease has been granted or is even imminently to be granted. In effect, what the Applicants seek is advice as to whether, were it to be determined that they hold native title and were a petroleum lease to be sought by and granted to Santos or to Delhi Petroleum by the State, that lease, if otherwise valid, would be an invalid future act if the negotiation requirements found in Subdiv P of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA were not complied with? The hypothetical nature of the application is self evident. To adapt the language employed by Zamir I and Lord Woolf in the passage quoted, the question would only be whether the Applicants, Santos and Delhi Petroleum were generally obliged to act in a certain way? Before anything more meaningful than an answer to that question could be given, the legal and factual issues just mentioned would have to be determined and occur. In Lardil (at 490, [136]), Dowsett J expressly adverted to the question of whether the Applicants in that case had standing to pursue the claim for relief insofar as it sought a declaration of invalidity under State law. His Honour doubted that they had standing. Nonetheless, he went on to consider the State law question, ultimately concluding that the decision sought to be impugned was valid. Of the other judges, French J, in the minority as to this aspect of the case, was of the view that there was no jurisdiction to determine the State law question. Though Merkel J expressed his agreement with the conclusion reached by Dowsett J as to the validity of the decision under State law, his Honour did not, in terms, expressly extend that agreement to the doubt as to standing which had been expressed by Dowsett J. In Lardil , the majority concluded that the Court had jurisdiction to decide the State law question of the validity of an act under that law because deciding that question was an essential step in any determination of whether there was a ""future act"" under the NTA. Here, the Applicants have commenced an application not materially distinguishable from Lardil which, in light of that case, is doomed to fail with respect to its Federal aspects. The essential connection with the Federal question provides the only jurisdiction which the Court could have to decide the State law question. In those circumstances, if there were jurisdiction to entertain the Federal question, the deciding of the State law question would be a matter of accrued jurisdiction in respect of which s 23 of the FCA Act would operate so as to confer jurisdiction. In light of Lardil and the fact that the present case is not materially distinguishable from that authority, the present case was doomed to fail. The Federal law aspect of the application was therefore, in the sense the term is used in the cases ""colourable"". That has the consequence that there is no jurisdiction to entertain the State law aspect of the claim, even if the Applicants had standing. Exercise of Discretion In the event that the foregoing conclusions are wrong, I should nonetheless not be disposed to the grant declaratory relief in respect of so much of the claim as remained and relied for its foundation on the State law question of whether it was lawfully possible to grant petroleum leases on the strength of ATP 259P. That would turn on a question as to whether on the particular dates pleaded there was a power of renewal in the Petroleum Act or otherwise under State law. Lardil indicates that jurisdiction would, in these contingent circumstances, exist to determine such a question in the accrued jurisdiction."
Case205,applied,Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257,"root authority in respect of what constitutes a ""matter"" for the purposes of a law conferring Federal jurisdiction is Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257. In that case (at 265) the following pronouncement was made in relation to s 76 of the Constitution : It was suggested in argument that ""matter"" meant no more than legal proceeding, and that Parliament might at its discretion create or invent a legal proceeding in which this Court might be called on to interpret the Constitution by a declaration at large. We do not accept this contention; we do not think that the word ""matter"" in sec. 76 means a legal proceeding, but rather the subject matter for determination in a legal proceeding. In our opinion there can be no matter within the meaning of the section unless there is some immediate right, duty or liability to be established by the determination of the Court. If the matter exists, the Legislature may no doubt prescribe the means by which the determination of the Court is to be obtained, and for that purpose may, we think, adopt any existing method of legal procedure or invent a new one. But it cannot authorize this Court to make a declaration of the law divorced from any attempt to administer that law. Put shortly, the giving of an advisory opinion is antithetical to an exercise of Federal jurisdiction. The Applicants do not (and could not) contest that the relevant test reposes in this pronouncement. Rather, they submit that, in terms of the course of authority with respect to that pronouncement, a ""matter"" does exist. They point to the existence of present negotiations and submit that there is an issue between them and the Respondents, evident from the relief sought, which is and will remain real and not hypothetical unless and until: (a) Santos and Delhi Petroleum disclaim any right to have the State grant to them as a pre-existing rights based act a petroleum lease in respect of the claimed land under the Petroleum Act or indicate that they will not be seeking the grant of such a lease; or (b) The State indicates that it agreed with the Applicants that the grant of such a lease was not a pre-existing rights based act and that it would not grant such a lease to Santos and Delhi Petroleum."
Case206,considered,Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner [2004] FCA 1440 ; (2004) 139 FCR 394,"and Delhi Petroleum contend that there is an absence of any pleading in this case of material facts giving rise to a specific dispute. In that absence, they submit, is to be found a crucial difference between a ""matter"", albeit one arising in respect of conduct yet to take place, in which declaratory relief may permissibly be sought in the exercise of Federal jurisdiction and the seeking of such relief on a purely hypothetical basis. An example of the presence of such a difference telling against the existence of jurisdiction is, they submit, to be found in Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner [2004] FCA 1440 ; (2004) 139 FCR 394 ( Private Detectives Case )."
Case207,applied,Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334,"Private Detectives Case is but a particular example of the application of the principles expounded in the joint judgment in Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 as to the means of differentiating between a permissible invocation of judicial power and the impermissible posing of an academic or hypothetical question. That exposition is of particular importance because of the way in which ""matter"" has come to be understood for the purposes of Federal jurisdiction. The following propositions emerge from that exposition: (a) The purpose of a judicial determination is the making of a conclusive or final decision based on a concrete and established or agreed situation which aims to quell a controversy (at 355, [44]); (b) In light of that purpose, courts have traditionally refused to provide answers to hypothetical questions or to give advisory opinions (at 355-356, [47]); (c) It does not violate this proposition for a declaration to be sought as to whether conduct which has not yet taken place will not be in breach of contract or a law (at 356, [47]); and (d) The crucial difference between the seeking of such a declaration and an advisory opinion is whether what is sought is based on a concrete situation as opposed to being divorced from the facts (at 356, [48]). The last of these propositions was illustrated by the High Court in that case (at 356, [48]) by reference, with evident approval, to the following passage from Zamir I and Lord Woolf, The Declaratory Judgement, (2 nd ed, 1993) at 132: ""If ... the dispute is not attached to specific facts, and the question is only whether the plaintiff is generally entitled to act in a certain way, the issue will still be considered theoretical. The main reason for this is that there may be no certainty that such a general declaration will settle the dispute finally. Subsequent to that declaration a person (the defendant himself or someone else) may be adversely affected by a particular act of the plaintiff. It may then be doubtful whether this act is covered by the declaration. In such a case the affected person will probably be entitled to raise the issue again on its special facts. Indeed, such a declaration will in effect be a mere advisory opinion."" [Emphasis in original] In the Private Detectives Case (at 401-402, [29]-[32]) Sackville J analysed the nature and effect of the pleaded case in the following way: In the present case, a reading of the Statement of Claim makes it plain that the Institute seeks the declarations it claims independently of any specific factual allegations. The pleading does not allege that the Institute or its members have sought specific information from an identified organisation for a particular purpose. Nor is it alleged that the organisation denied the request by reason of a particular provision of the Privacy Act or determination of the Commissioner. As I have noted, the Institute seeks no relief in respect of any refusal by the Commissioner to make a determination under s 72 of the Privacy Act. The Statement of Claim merely alleges that the Institute 'through its members' undertakes investigations on behalf of clients in connection with 'litigation, potential litigation and matters related to litigation' and that the investigations involve obtaining personal information from organisations which record the information for their own business purposes (pars 4, 6). It is then said that the Privacy Act proscribes the disclosure by organisations of personal information to the Institute and its members unless the disclosure is 'required or authorised by or under law'. The Statement of Claim does not identify the circumstances in which particular investigations have taken place, the organisations requested for information or the particular use to which the information was intended to be put. The difficulty is not that declarations sought by the Institute go merely to future events or circumstances. The difficulty is that they cannot quell any existing controversy between the Institute and the Commissioner. The first declaration, before it can be meaningful, requires a number of factual and legal issues to be determined. It must be established that the disclosing entity is an 'organisation' within the meaning of the Privacy Act and that the organisation is subject to the National Privacy Principles. The disclosure must be of 'personal information', as defined in the Privacy Act . It also must be for the purpose of enabling the Institute or a member to investigate on behalf of citizens in corporations 'matters concerning litigation, or potential litigation' (whose purpose is not made clear). The second declaration creates the same difficulties. The conclusion which his Honour reached as a result of that analysis (at 402, [32]) was that, ""in effect, the Institute seeks an advisory opinion from the Court without reference to any concrete facts"". That conclusion was fatal for the Applicant Institute in that case. Applying the propositions evident in Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd , Sackville J held that the proceeding did not involve a ""matter"" and hence that the Court lacked jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act to entertain the Institute's claim for declaratory relief."
Case208,distinguished,Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (2000) 200 CLR 591,"unlike in Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (2000) 200 CLR 591 , the Applicants do not have the benefit of any provision affording them any particular standing to seek any of the relief claimed in the application. While the position would be different if they had the benefit of a native title determination in their favour or even if the relief were sought in the context of an application for a determination of native title, the Applicants are strangers to any dealings between the State and Santos and Delhi Petroleum with respect to the granting of a particular petroleum lease. Their mere status as a registered native title claimant does not, in my opinion, give them standing to claim any of the relief sought, including any part which relies only on State law."

Case215,followed,Platypus Leasing Inc v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2005) 189 FLR 411,"is one thing; whether or not it is appropriate to exercise it is another. There is no right to declaratory relief. In Platypus Leasing Inc v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2005) 189 FLR 411 Gzell J of the New South Wales Supreme Court referred (at [81]) to the undesirability of the use of declaratory relief as a ""staging post"" in litigation. In refusing, as a matter of discretion, to grant declaratory relief in respect of a goods and services tax controversy not yet the subject of an assessment his Honour referred with approval to the following observation made by Young J in McKeown v Cavalier Yachts Pty Ltd (1988) 13 NSWLR 303 at 312: The plaintiff's summons asks for a declaration that the yacht is the property of the plaintiff. I do not believe that such a declaration should be made. Declarations should not be made as a staging post in litigation, and in a case where some executive orders have to be made, it is usually best to proceed to consider those executive orders rather than making declarations. I share the diffidence of Young J and Gzell J in relation to the use of declaratory relief as a ""staging post"". On behalf of Santos and Delhi Petroleum it was submitted that the declarations sought by the Applicants in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Amended Application were staging posts to the end of an assertion in the future of a right to negotiate. I agree that this is, in any event, the true way of conceiving the declarations sought. Therefore, even if for that reason alone, I should not be disposed, as a matter of discretion, to grant that relief. Outcome Given the conclusions which I have reached, the appropriate course to take in the circumstances is to dismiss the application. The alternative suggested, striking out of the amended statement of claim, is not appropriate. The only way to address the fundamental jurisdictional difficulty presently attending the application would be to plead a claim for native title. That would be pregnant with a potential for embarrassment derived from different findings given that the Applicants already claim a native title determination in respect of the claim land in other proceedings in the Court. Further, I have in any event concluded that it is not appropriate, as a matter of discretion, to grant the declaratory relief sought. For these reasons, I should not be disposed to allow any such amendment. I shall hear from the parties as to costs, including whether costs should merely follow the event or whether s 85A of the NTA operates so as to require each party to bear their own costs.

Case217,cited,Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 571,"this case there is evidence that the respondent has sold or attempted to sell Super Bubble to third parties. 24 Prima facie , it appears that the respondent has infringed the applicant's patent. In my view, there is a serious question to be tried. Irreparable harm In both written and oral submissions, the applicant has asserted: 1. The applicant commercially exploits the patent by producing an insulation product known as 'Glareshield'. According to the affidavit of Mr Nicholas Martinovich, the National Sales Manager for the applicant, filed 28 June 2006, Glareshield is by far the single biggest selling product of the applicant, accounting for approximately 85 per cent of the total insulation product sales of the applicant in Australia. 2. Already two of its shed customers, Action Garages and another entity identified as Coastal Garages, are no longer purchasing Glareshield from the applicant's New South Wales distributor, however these customers continue in business. The applicant believes that at least one of these former customers is purchasing Super Bubble from the respondent. 3. The applicant's New South Wales licensee has suffered losses in excess of $30 000 for the period March to May 2006, which losses are also affecting the business of the applicant. 4. The threat to the loss of sales of Glareshield may result in a diminished ability of the applicant to undertake research and development which would place the ongoing viability of the applicant at risk. From the evidence presented this morning it is likely that damages in this case would be an inadequate remedy should the applicant be successful at trial. Alleged 'poaching' of customers by the respondent, the importance of the Glareshield product to the applicant's business, and goodwill associated with the product indicate that irreparable harm is a possible consequence of continuation of the respondent's activities. I also note the submission of the applicant that the respondent appears to have a paid-up capital of $10, rendering a damages award potentially worthless. Balance of convenience Through the affidavit of Mr Scott Gibson, the managing director of the applicant, filed 28 June 2006, the applicant has offered an undertaking as to damages in the event of success in obtaining interlocutory relief. In view of this undertaking, in addition to the harm the applicant says that it is experiencing from the respondent's conduct and the fact that there is a serious question to be tried, the relief sought by the applicant is appropriate. COSTS The applicant has made a number of submissions to me in relation to costs in this matter. In essence the applicant seeks costs on an indemnity basis, or, alternatively, an order under Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3, that costs be taxed and paid forthwith. Indemnity costs In oral and written submissions Mr Logan for the applicant relied on two points in support of an order for indemnity costs. First, the applicant relied on what it describes as a pattern of deliberate and calculated conduct in cynical and flagrant disregard of the applicant's intellectual property rights which has resulted in the need to appear before me today. Counsel cited Masha Nominees v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 56 as authority that pre-litigation conduct may be considered in the context of determining whether the circumstances as a whole warrant the making of an indemnity costs order. Second, citing Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225, the applicant states that where an applicant has commenced a proceeding in circumstances where, properly advised, it should have known that there was no chance of success then that is a circumstance which would justify an indemnity costs order. Counsel for the applicant submits that, by analogy to a respondent , such order would be justified where there is no defence asserted, but the respondent continues its conduct so as to put the applicant in a position where it can do nothing other than commence proceedings and incur substantial expense in mounting an interlocutory relief application, where, in effect, properly advised it ought always to have known that there was no answer to the application. Whilst I note the applicant's submissions in relation to indemnity costs I am not persuaded at this stage that this is a case in which there are special or unusual features such as to justify the Court departing from the ordinary practice. Whilst I accept that there is a serious question to be tried and that an interlocutory injunction should be granted I am not of the view that, in the absence of submissions from the respondent, I can be certain that the respondent has no defence and is acting in such a way as having its only purpose ensuring the applicant incurs substantial expense. I note that the respondent currently has different legal representatives to those which were retained when the applicant first commenced raising concerns with the respondent over the patent, and apparently the parties have been engaged in discussions over the past few weeks. I am unaware of how long its current legal representatives have been acting on the respondent's behalf. In these circumstances I am not of the view that an order for costs on an indemnity basis would be just and appropriate. Order 62 rule 3 In oral submissions, Mr Logan pressed that a costs order of some nature ought to be made today and that this is a case where an order allowing the applicant to tax its costs forthwith is warranted. The applicant submits that due to the conduct of the respondent significant additional costs in preparation for the interlocutory hearing have been incurred. Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3 provides: 'An order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not, unless the Court otherwise orders, entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceedings in which the interlocutory order is made is concluded or further order.' I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate circumstance in which to order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith. I note the observations of Emmett J in Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 571 where his Honour considered the rationale for the rule: 'The rationale for such a provision appears to me to be that, since an interlocutory proceeding does not resolve the final issue between the parties, it would, in ordinary circumstances, be inappropriate that an unsuccessful party in an interlocutory proceeding be required to pay costs immediately, as that party might ultimately be entitled to an order for costs in the substantive proceeding. The general principle appears to be that costs ought to be resolved when the proceeding has been concluded, and the rights of the parties have been finally determined.' The rule, of course anticipates that there will be some circumstances where the general principle should be diverted from. As discussed earlier in this judgment I am not persuaded that this is a case where the applicant has incurred significant additional costs by reason of the respondent's conduct in respect of this litigation. While the respondent has failed to appear today and has not entered a notice of appearance I am not persuaded that the applicant would have incurred less costs if the respondent had appeared before me today. While the applicant has incurred considerable costs in this matter in relation to its intellectual property rights the situation is not one of special circumstances such as to divert from the general principles. The future course of this litigation may shed more light on the conduct of the respondent such as to justify special orders as to costs however, in my view, having not had the benefit of submissions from the respondent today, the appropriate order is that the issue of costs be reserved. CONCLUSION It is unfortunate that the respondent has not appeared today. However in view of the evidence presented by the applicant, I am persuaded that it would be appropriate to grant the applicant the interlocutory relief it seeks. In oral submissions, the applicant pressed for permanent relief to be granted by the Court today. However I am not persuaded on the facts that it would be an appropriate order. Notwithstanding the failure of the respondent to appear today, I note that the matter has been treated by all parties and indeed conducted by the applicant in the lead up to the hearing this morning as an application for interlocutory relief. On that basis, it is reasonable to presume that the respondent was expecting to have its day in court when the application for permanent relief was heard. Accordingly, I make orders as follows: 1. Upon the undertaking of the applicant: (a) to submit to such order (if any) as the Court may consider to be just for the payment of compensation, in an amount to be assessed by the Court or as it may direct, to the respondent should it be found that it has been adversely affected by the operation of the interlocutory order set out in par 2 below or any continuation (with or without variation) thereof; and (b) to pay such compensation referred to in par 1(a) above and as directed by the Court; 2. Until the trial of this proceeding, or further order, an interlocutory injunction to restrain the respondent whether by itself, its directors, officers, servants, agents or otherwise howsoever during the term of Australian Innovation Patent No 200310063 ('the patent') or any extension thereof from infringing the patent, including by the importing, making, offering to make, selling, offering for sale, disposing of, offering to dispose of, using, or keeping for the purpose of doing any of those things, the insulation product known as Super Bubble, or authorising the doing of any of those acts. 3. Costs be reserved. I certify that the preceding thirty-nine (39) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

Case219,cited,Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225,"this case there is evidence that the respondent has sold or attempted to sell Super Bubble to third parties. 24 Prima facie , it appears that the respondent has infringed the applicant's patent. In my view, there is a serious question to be tried. Irreparable harm In both written and oral submissions, the applicant has asserted: 1. The applicant commercially exploits the patent by producing an insulation product known as 'Glareshield'. According to the affidavit of Mr Nicholas Martinovich, the National Sales Manager for the applicant, filed 28 June 2006, Glareshield is by far the single biggest selling product of the applicant, accounting for approximately 85 per cent of the total insulation product sales of the applicant in Australia. 2.

Case226,followed,R v Davis [1995] FCA 1321 ; (1995) 57 FCR 512,public administration of justice and the consequent ability for the public freely to observe it and for the media readily to report it is a safeguard against the abuse of the very considerable authority entailed in the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth: R v Davis [1995] FCA 1321 ; (1995) 57 FCR 512 at 514.
Case227,considered,Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 148 FCR 1,"of the administration of justice is one thing; the ability freely to inspect every document on the Court's file is another. So much is evident from the structure of O 46 r 6. Rule 6(2) lists out those types of document which may be inspected as of right with r 6(3) then providing that the ability to inspect other types of document requires a grant of leave. As to the latter, while there may be a general disposition to permit a non-party to have access to such non-confidential affidavits and exhibits as are admitted into evidence: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 148 FCR 1 , at [26], the extent of further access must in each case be considered on its merits. That is so even in relation to material read in open court or referred to by a judge: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 3) (2002) ATPR 41-873 at [7]. One factor which can be relevant to the withholding of access is the approach adopted by the parties to objections to evidence."
Case228,referred to,Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FMCA 1821,"This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (Phipps FM): Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FMCA 1821. In hearing and determining the appeal, I am exercising the powers of the Full Court pursuant to a determination by the Chief Justice under s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 2 Phipps FM dismissed the appellant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice served on him by the respondent. Before the Magistrate, the appellant put forward three bases for the setting aside of the notice. 3 The first basis was that the notice was based on a debt that had been paid. 24 Leaving aside the gratuitous insult in ground (h), the Magistrate was hardly obliged to deal with an issue that was not raised before him. It follows that I also do not need to deal with it. Grounds (b) and (h) must fail. In any case, I agree with what Hayne J said to the appellant about the issue in Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2004] HCATrans 562: ""These arguments are variants on arguments that have sometimes been put in the Court. They are arguments that always end up proving far too much, Mr Moran, as they are arguments that, if they had any legs which they do not it would demonstrate that there was no ownership of land, there was no Corporations Law, and the arguments of a kind commonly deployed to demonstrate that somebody does not owe taxation. It always proved too much."" 25 Ground of appeal (c) relates to the note. It must also fail. 26 The Magistrate said at [5] that: ""A promissory note does not constitute payment for costs, It was returned by [solicitors for the respondent] by return mail in which they said it did not constitute legal tender. A promissory note cannot constitute payment in the absence of acceptance of the promissory note or agreement that payment is to be made by promissory note. Neither of those two things exist here. In addition, there is no evidence of an ability to satisfy the promissory note. Finally, it needs to be said, the order for costs made by the Court of Appeal contained no stay, nor did the Master's order fixing the amount of the costs. The promissory note, on its face, is payable at 4pm on 31 January 2025. ..."""
Case229,cited,Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223,"According to the appellant, grounds of appeal (a) and (g) fix on what the Magistrate said at [15] and [16]: ""[The appellant] is seeking to satisfy the Court that he has a counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand as those terms are used in s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). It is not sufficient for a debtor to assert that he has a claim and then set out the basis for the claim. He must satisfy the Court that he has a genuine demand. The Court must be satisfied it has a reasonable prospect of success. I refer to Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [52] as one of the authorities for that proposition. The debtor must show that he has a prima face case even if he does not adduce the admissible evidence which would make out a prima facie case (Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1960] HCA 50 ; (1960) 104 CLR 346 at 350). The [appellant] does not show that he has a claim to pursue. He has attempted to establish a claim in the Supreme Court of Victoria and the proceeding has been dismissed. He has lodged an appeal against the decision of Mandie J, but that does not establish that his claim has any merit or any prospects of success, whether he has a prima facie case or a reasonable prospect of success."" As noted at [6], the appeal against the decision of Mandie J is stayed pending the provision of security for costs. 12 Ground of appeal (a) is misconceived. The Magistrate did not ""assume the outcome of [that] appeal"". He did what the authorities (ie Bhagat and Ebert ) called upon him to do: namely, make an assessment solely for the purposes of the application before him of the prospects of success of the appeal. In making that assessment, he did not purport to decide the outcome of that appeal: the Court of Appeal is not bound to agree with that assessment if and when it comes to decide the appeal. Further, the Magistrate could only have made that assessment on the basis of ""submissions and affidavit material""."

Case231,cited,Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511,"As to the first proposition set out at [14], the appellant contends that the Magistrate cannot exercise the jurisdiction of a state court. (Presumably, that contention is made in reliance on Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511.) However, the Magistrate did not purport to do that. All he did was record as part of the task described at [12] what Master Evans had said about the claim. In so doing, he referred to an affidavit of Robert McGirr of solicitors for the respondent which reference is the subject of the second proposition set out at [14]. However, the appellant relied on Mr McGirr's affidavit before the Magistrate having exhibited it to an affidavit of his own. It does not lie in the appellant's mouth to now complain that Mr McGirr's affidavit was used against him even if he only intended to rely on it in some respects and not others. 17 Grounds of appeal (e) and (f) relate to the substance of the claim which the Magistrate described at [8] to [11]. 18 According to the appellant, ground of appeal (e) fixes on what the Magistrate said in the last sentence at [12]: ""The only avenue open to [the appellant] was as a lessee, but that would only be if his lease was granted with the approval of the first mortgagee, which it was not."" The appellant complains that this amounts to a ruling on a crucial issue in the claim: namely, who was the first mortgagee of a property located at Clarkes Hill that was sold by the respondent."
Case232,distinguished,Ex parte Matthew; Re Matthew (1884) 12 QBD 506,"The appellant relies on the following passage in PP McQuade and MGR Gronow, McDonald , Henry and Meek: Bankruptcy Law and Practice (5 th edn, 1996) at [40.1.335]: ""A creditor who, after he or she has served a bankruptcy notice, takes from the debtor a bill of exchange or promissory note for the debt, cannot, during the currency of the bill or the note, obtain a sequestration order founded on the notice, since, until the bill or note is dishonoured, it must be treated as payment (Ex parte Matthew; Re Matthew (1884) 12 QBD 506) and the position is the same, if, although dishonoured, it is in the hands of a third person to whom it has been endorsed for value by the creditor: Re Debtor [1908] 1 KB 344."" That passage does not assist the appellant. It assumes that the creditor has accepted the note. That the author uses the word ""take"" in that sense is made clear when one reads the two cases to which he refers. In each of those cases, the note had been accepted. For the same reason, each of those cases can be distinguished from the instant case."

Case235,discussed,Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 46 ; (1982) 150 CLR 160,"The majority also referred to the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 ( Fontana Films ) . The majority said at [163]: Gibbs CJ pointed out [Fontana Films [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 181; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 615] that, like the aliens power (s 51 (xix)), the corporations power is conferred ""by reference to persons"". He continued [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 181-2; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616]: However, having regard to the federal nature of the Constitution , it is difficult to suppose that the powers conferred by pars (xix) and (xx) were intended to extend to the enactment of a complete code of laws, on all subjects, applicable to the persons named in those paragraphs ... [I]n the case of the corporations described in s 51 (xx), extraordinary consequences would result if the Parliament had power to make any kind of law on any subject affecting such corporations ... Other difficulties in relation to s 51 (xx) are caused by the need to construe the Constitution as a whole, and thus to reconcile par (xx) with other parts of s 51. Although Gibbs CJ concluded [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] that it was both unnecessary and undesirable to attempt to define the outer limits of s 51(xx) , he did say [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] that: The words of par (xx) suggest that the nature of the corporation to which the laws relate must be significant as an element in the nature or character of the laws, if they are to be valid ... In other words, in the case of trading and financial corporations, laws which relate to their trading and financial activities will be within the power. As to foreign corporations, he added [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 183; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616-17] that ""the fact that the corporation is a foreign corporation should be significant in the way in which the law relates to it"". 16 The majority noted in [165]: ... the statements made by Gibbs CJ about laws relating to the trading and financial activities of trading and financial corporations being within power are to be understood as responding to the arguments advanced in that case. They are not to be read as attempting an exhaustive statement of the ambit of the power. Gibbs CJ explicitly denied [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] any intention of doing that. That said, it must be recognised that Gibbs CJ emphasised the importance of giving due weight to the words ""foreign"", ""trading"", and ""financial"" in considering the application of s 51(xx). 25 The majority said, at [55]: The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s 51(xx). It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. (Plainly, a foreign corporation is a corporation formed outside the limits of the Commonwealth.) No party or intervener called in question what was said about trading and financial corporations in R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] , Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 ; 40 ALR 609] , State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [(1982) [1982] HCA 72 ; 150 CLR 282 ; 44 ALR 1] or Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; [(1983) 152 CLR 570 ; 46 ALR 41]."
Case236,followed,Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth [1948] HCA 7 ; (1948) 76 CLR 1,"In Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth [1948] HCA 7 ; (1948) 76 CLR 1 , Dixon J said, at 381: It has been said that ""trade"" strictly means the buying and selling of goods. That, however, is a specialized meaning of the word. The present primary meaning is much wider, covering as it does the pursuit of a calling or handicraft, and its history emphasizes rather use, regularity and course of conduct, than concern with commodities. 132 Counsel for the Etheridge Shire Council submitted the activities of the council in the following areas, constituted trading: Operation of the Terrestrial Centre. [The Terrestrial Centre is described as ""a visiting information centre and tourism facility which displays the Ted Elliott mineral collection"". It is operated as a tourist attraction in the shire.] Road works for the Department of Works . [It may be recalled that Section 36 of the LGA provides that local governments in Queensland may enter into contracts and charge for services at facilities it supplies, and s 29 of the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 provides that the Chief Executive of Main Roads may enter into contracts for the State of Queensland with other persons, including local governments, for the carrying out of road works on a state controlled road.] 133 Mr K. Watson of Counsel, for the Etheridge Shire Council, submitted as his primary submission that, as at 21 October 2006, these activities together with ""the receipt of investment income"" either alone, or some, or all in combination, were significant or substantial trading and financial activities of the Etheridge Shire Council, and with the consequence that the Etheridge Shire Council was an ""employer"" pursuant to s 6 of the WRA."
Case237,cited,Commonwealth v State of Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam Case) [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 158 CLR 1,"The submissions on behalf of the applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 refer to cases decided by the High Court that have considered the question of whether particular entities are trading or financial corporations: a football club in Adamson's case ; a statutory corporation generating and selling electricity in Commonwealth v State of Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 158 CLR 1 ( Tasmanian Dams case); a State Corporation conducting financial trading activities in order to finance and operate a superannuation scheme in State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 ; and a dormant shelf company which had not yet commenced to trade in any capacity in Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8. The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations; nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive: State Superannuation Board at 303."

Case242,cited,Huddart Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead [1909] HCA 36 ; (1908) 8 CLR 330,"Later, at 552-553, Menzies J said: The difference between a trading corporation and a municipal corporation was noticed in this Court as early as 1908 in Huddart Parker &amp; Co.

Moorehead when Isaacs J., in considering the language of s. 51(xx.) of the Constitution , said [1909] HCA 36 ; [(1908) 8 C.L.R. 330 , at p.393]: "". . . it is always a preliminary question whether a given company is a trading or financial corporation or a foreign corporation. This leaves entirely outside the range of federal power, as being in themselves objects of the power, all those domestic corporations, for instance, which are constituted for municipal, mining, manufacturing, religious, scholastic, charitable, scientific, and literary purposes, and possibly others more nearly approximating a character of trading; a strong circumstance to show how and to what extent the autonomy of the States was intended to be safe-guarded. The federal power was sufficiently limited by specific enumeration, and there is no need to place further limits on the words of the legislature."""
Case243,considered,Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 19 FCR 10,"Reference should also be made to the judgment of Toohey J in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 19 FCR 10 ( Hughes ). 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1.

Case248,followed,New South Wales v Commonwealth (Work Choices Case) [2006] HCA 52 ; (2006) 229 CLR 1,"On 14 November 2006, the High Court delivered judgment in New South Wales v Commonwealth (2006) 229 CLR 1 ; [2006] HCA 52 ( Work Choices Case ) concerning the validity of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth) (the Work Choices Act) as enacted in December 2005. The Work Choices Act changed the constitutional basis for the WRA. As a consequence of the Work Choices Act, the WRA is now substantially an exercise of the corporations power under s 51(xx) of the Constitution , rather than an exercise of the conciliation and arbitration power under s 51(xxxv). 5 The WRA, as amended, defines ""employee"" in s 5(1) as an individual so far as he or she is employed, or usually employed, by an employer as defined in s 6(1). 6 ""Employer"" is defined in s 6(1) as meaning: (a) a constitutional corporation, so far as it employs, or usually employs, an individual; or (b) the Commonwealth, so far as it employs, or usually employs, an individual; or (c) a Commonwealth authority, so far as it employs, or usually employs, an individual; or (d) a person or entity (which may be an unincorporated club) so far as the person or entity, in connection with constitutional trade or commerce, employs, or usually employs, an individual as: (i) a flight crew officer; or (ii) a maritime worker; or (iii) a waterside workers; or (e) a body corporate incorporated in a Territory, so far as the body employs, or usually employs, an individual; or (f) a person or entity (which may be an unincorporated club) that carries on an activity (whether of a commercial, governmental or other nature) in a Territory in Australia, so far as the person or entity employs, or usually employs, an individual in connection with the activity carried on in the Territory. 9 The High Court in the Work Choices Case , by a majority of five to two, held that the Work Choices Act was valid. The majority concluded that the understanding of the power conferred by s 51(xx) as explained by Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ in Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner (1995) 183 CLR 323 ; 128 ALR 81 ; [1995] HCA 16 ( Re Dingjan) and amplified by Gaudron J in Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd; Ex parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2000) 203 CLR 346 ; 172 ALR 257 ; [2000] HCA 34 ( Pacific Coal ) should be adopted. 17 The majority in the Work Choices Case , in seeking to determine the ambit of laws which apply to constitutional corporations, referred to the dissenting members of the Court in Re Dingjan [1995] HCA 16 ; (1995) 183 CLR 323. The majority said, at [177]: ... Particular reference need now be made only to the reasons of Gaudron J (with which Deane J agreed). Her Honour's reasoning proceeded by the following steps. [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111]. First, the business activities of corporations formed within Australia signify whether they are trading or financial corporations, and the main purpose of the power to legislate with respect to foreign corporations must be directed to their business activities in Australia. Second, it follows that the power conferred by s 51(xx) extends ""at the very least"" [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111] to the business functions and activities of constitutional corporations and to their business relationships. Third, once the second step is accepted, it follows that the power ""also extends to the persons by and through whom they carry out those functions and activities and with whom they enter into those relationships"". [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111]. 21 If it is, the acceptance by the majority in the Work Choices Case of the ambit of the power of the Commonwealth under s 51(xx) as described by Gaudron J in Pacific Coal , would mean that the Commonwealth has power to regulate the activities, functions, relationships and the business of the Etheridge Shire Council; the creation of rights and privileges belonging to the Etheridge Shire Council; the imposition of obligations on it; and, in respect of those matters, the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts, its employees, and also the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities, functions, relationships or business. 23 The constitutional framework erected by the Constitution referred to in the majority judgment in the Work Choices Case set out at para [12] above, including the observation from the Melbourne Corporation case, emphatically denies that possibility. 24 In the Work Choices Case , the majority of the High Court noted, at [9]: The term ""constitutional corporation"" is defined in s 4 to mean a corporation to which s 51(xx) of the Constitution applies. That paragraph refers to foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. No doubt there may be room for dispute, in relation to some corporations, about whether they are constitutional corporations within the meaning of the new Act. However, in the application of para (a) of the basic definition of employer, and the corresponding definition of employee, to a given corporation, the hypothesis is that it is a constitutional corporation. 28 Subsequent to the judgment of the High Court in the Work Choices Case , the Australian Workers Union of Employees, Queensland (the applicant), filed an application in this Court on 6 December 2006. Subsequently, an amended application, which included the Queensland Services, Industrial Union of Employees as the second applicant, was filed on 22 December 2006. That application sought ""declaratory orders pursuant to s 21 of The Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)"" declaring: ... the respective rights of the parties regarding a purported Workplace Agreement lodged by the First Respondent with the Second Respondent, purportedly in reliance upon sections 342 , 344 and 345 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 on the 21st October 2006, and described as ""Etheridge Shire Council Australia (Employee Collective) Workplace Agreement 2006"" (hereinafter called ""the Etheridge Agreement""). 29 The applicants sought that: It be declared: (i) that the First Respondent is not an ""employer"" within the meaning of section 6 of the Workplace Relations Act ; (ii) that the First Respondent was not lawfully entitled to lodge the Etheridge Agreement with the Second Respondent on 21 st October 2006, or at any time thereafter, under Part 8 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ; (iii) that the Etheridge Agreement did not come into operation as a workplace agreement in accordance with section 347(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 on 21 st October 2006, nor any time thereafter. (iv) that the Etheridge Agreement has no force and effect as a workplace agreement under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ; 30 On 5 February 2007, in proceedings QUD 39 of 2007, the State of Queensland sought similar declarations. 78 The observations of the High Court in the Work Choices Case , at [157] and [158] set out in [13]-[14] above, contrasts the view of the majority in St George City Council that the question of characterisation is to be determined by the purpose for which the corporation is formed, with the dissenting view of Barwick CJ that the ""activities test"" determines the character of a corporation, and that ""a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services"" was a trading corporation. 79 The comment by the majority in the Work Choices Case that the view of Barwick CJ ""did not then command the assent of the majority of the Court"" is to be understood as indicating that the ""activities test"" propounded by Barwick CJ was later accepted by the High Court in Adamson as the applicable test, and is the proper test to apply. 80 Mason J, in Adamson, said of a ""trading corporation"": Essentially, it is a description or label given to a corporation when its trading activities form a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation."

Case251,discussed,R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533,"There are further observations in the judgment of the majority which have a relevance to the present controversy. The majority said at [157]: By the time Fontana Films came to be decided, there had been controversy about what are ""trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth"". In particular, in R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; [(1974) 130 CLR 533 ; 2 ALR 371] , the court had held that a county council, established under the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW) for ""local government purposes"", empowered to sell electricity and sell and install electrical fittings and appliances, and pursuing only those activities, was not a trading corporation. In his dissenting opinion, Barwick CJ had said [1974] HCA 7 ; [(1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543] that ""a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services"" was a trading corporation. But this view did not then command the assent of a majority of the court. 14 The majority continued at [158]: In R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] [Adamson] St George County Council was distinguished. Associations incorporated under associations incorporation legislation, whose principal objects were the promotion, control and management of Australian Rules football matches, were held to be trading corporations. Mason J said [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 at 233; [1979] HCA 6 ; 23 ALR 439 at 472]: ""Trading corporation"" is not and never has been a term of art or one having a special legal meaning. Nor, as the Chief Justice pointed out [in St George County Council ], was there a generally accepted definition of the expression in the nineteenth century. Essentially it is a description or label given to a corporation when its trading activities form a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation. 48 The High Court decision of The Queen v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex Parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 ( St George County Council ) is not directly on point, but, in my opinion, is of assistance on the question of characterisation, when one contrasts the powers and activities the subject of consideration in that case, with the powers and activities of the Etheridge Shire Council in the present case. 49 In that case, the St George County Council was established under the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW) for ""local government purposes"". It was empowered within its district to supply electricity and to supply and install electrical fitting and appliances, and these were its only activities . The Act provided that the county council should ""endeavour so to conduct each trading undertaking that without any loss being incurred the service, product, or commodity of the undertaking may be supplied to the consumer as cheaply as possible"". 50 The High Court, by a majority (McTiernan, Menzies and Gibbs JJ, with Barwick CJ and Stephen J dissenting) held that the St George County Council was not a ""trading corporation"" within s 5 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971-1972 (Cth). The majority accepted that the St George County Council was not a ""trading corporation"", notwithstanding that it carried on trading activities. 51 It was submitted on behalf of the State of New South Wales, intervening, that a ""trading corporation"" connotes more than a corporation which trades. It was submitted that ""trading"" describes the nature or quality of the corporation itself rather than its actual activities. For the Commonwealth of Australia, it was submitted that the St George County Council was set up to sell electrical fittings and appliances, and that to do that was to trade. It was therefore a ""trading corporation"". It was submitted that ""[I]ts actual activities characterize it."" 52 Barwick CJ said, at 538: The question raised by the case involves the construction of the expression ""trading corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth"" as it appears in the Act through the definition for the purposes of the Act of a ""corporation"". Because of identity of language and the fact that the statutory formula is designed to keep the Act within constitutional power, that construction would be applicable to the words of the Constitution , a circumstance which must influence the construction placed on the statutory formula. I ought to point out at the outset that the ultimate question in the case is to be answered in relation to the applicant and not as to all county councils. The powers and functions which under the Act may be transferred to a county council are diverse (cf., e.g. s. 564(1) and (2)). Consequently, considerations which, in my opinion, are definitive in this case may not be so in the case of other county councils with different powers and activities. (Emphasis added). 53 Importantly, Barwick CJ noted, at 539: ... the description ""trading corporation"", in my opinion, refers not to the purpose of incorporation but to the activities of the corporation at the relevant time. So far then the applicant is evidently a corporation which has been formed within the Commonwealth. It trades in the supply of electricity, of electrical appliances and of electrical services. It has no other purpose or activity. 54 Barwick CJ suggested that there did not appear to have been any generally accepted definition of a trading corporation. He said, at 541: It was assumed, I think, that such a corporation could be identified by its activities. If its nature was being sought, it was to be found in what it did. 55 Barwick CJ said, at 543: To say that a corporation's description for relevant purposes will be determined by its activities does not mean, of course, that a corporation which to any extent engages in trade is a trading corporation. It is evident that the legislative power given by s. 51(xx.) is not a power to legislate with respect to trading. It is a legislative power with respect to some corporations. But a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services will, in my opinion, satisfy the description : and a corporation which does nothing but trade and, if it matters, was incorporated so that it could trade, i.e. exercise the trading powers of the constituent local government councils, is, in my opinion, properly described as a trading corporation within the constitutional power. It seems to me that the reason why a corporation trades as its sole or predominant and characteristic activity is irrelevant to the description of the corporation for present purposes, that is to say, the ends which such a corporation seeks to serve by trading are irrelevant to its description. As I have indicated, the purpose of the grant of legislative power includes the control of the corporate activities of the corporation : it is not so concerned with the motives which prompt those activities, nor the ultimate ends which those activities hope to achieve. If, upon that consideration, the corporation can fairly be described by reason of those activities, their extent and relative significance in the affairs of the corporation as a ""trading corporation"" it will, in my opinion, be nothing to the point that it is also a government or State or municipal corporation. The effect of the trading activities of such a corporation upon and in the community will not be lessened or necessarily affected by the fact that it is a State or municipal instrumentality. (Emphasis added). 56 The first and fourth sentences of this passage identify the basis for his conclusion that, in that case, St George County Council was a trading corporation. 57 Relevant to the contention of the union applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 that the Etheridge Shire Council is a municipal corporation, a tier of State government in its own right, and therefore cannot be also a constitutional corporation, Barwick CJ said, at 544-545: It may be granted that the applicant may properly be styled a ""municipal"" corporation; it is both the creature and servant of ""local government"": but it is, none the less, in my opinion, a trading corporation within the statutory definition. It is easily demonstrated that the purpose of the applicant's incorporation and of its activities is the performance of what has come to be regarded as a local government function, its charter being to provide electricity at low cost to the ratepayer. But it is to achieve and satisfy this purpose by trading, both in electricity and in electrical goods and services. It buys and sells an activity recognized by the Act itself as ""a trading undertaking"" (s.418(1) and (2)). To say that it is a ""municipal"" corporation is, in my opinion, to say no more than that it is a government, or local government, agency; or, put another way, that it is a municipal trading corporation. 58 Menzies J in the majority said, at 551: The submission of the Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth, who appeared for the respondents, was that the Council is and has always been a trading corporation. He relied exclusively upon the contention that this Council had been established for no purpose other than to trade and he refrained from submitting, in these proceedings, that a local government corporation which has local government purposes other than trading purposes is a ""trading corporation"" within the meaning of s. 5. (Emphasis added). 59 Later, at 551, Menzies J said: It is because trading of a council is subordinate to its governmental purposes that the Act contains a section such as s. 419. It is this subordination of trading to community purposes that is, to my mind, the real importance of s. 419 in this case. It reveals the very nature of a council to which it applies. 60 Menzies J said, at 552: It seems to me that trading corporations were in 1900 a well-recognized classification of companies. 62 Gibbs J (as he then was) said, at 561: The question ... is whether the County Council is a trading corporation. In my opinion, the words ""trading corporation"" in s. 51(xx.) do not mean ""a corporation which is trading"". The word ""trading"" forms part of a composite expression and indicates the essential attribute of the kind of corporation to which it refers. It is common to describe corporations according to their nature, and to speak, for example, of ecclesiastical, eleemosynary or municipal corporations. There can be no doubt that the words ""foreign corporations"" and ""financial corporations"" in pl. (xx.) describe corporations of a particular kind rather than corporations of any kind which happen to act in a particular way. The same is true of the words ""trading corporations"" which, in their natural meaning, as well as in the context of the placitum, refer to corporations of a particular kind. 63 At 562, his Honour said: A trading corporation is one formed for the purpose of trading. However, as I have indicated, the mere fact that a corporation is trading does not mean that it is a trading corporation. It is necessary to determine the true character of the corporation, upon a consideration of all the circumstances that throw light on the purpose for which it was formed. Thus there is no difficulty in holding that the fact that a corporation carries on some trade which is merely incidental or ancillary to the fulfilment of its main purpose does not give it the character of a trading corporation. 64 Gibbs J said, 564: When all these facts are considered, the proper conclusion in my opinion is that the County Council is a corporation constituted for the purposes of local government to provide an essential service to the inhabitants of an aggregation of local authority areas, under conditions thought most likely to prove beneficial to them. It is properly described as a municipal corporation. The description to the corporations to which the powers of s. 51 (xx.) extend does not include municipal corporations. 65 Gibbs J went on to say, at 565: It seems to me that the purpose of specifically mentioning the corporations intended to be within the power given by s. 51 (xx.) was to exclude from the scope of the power at least those corporations which could properly be characterized as municipal and charitable corporations. ... The purpose of its [the County Council's] formation is more properly described as that of fulfilling a function of local government. 66 Stephen J, who formed a minority with Barwick CJ in St George County Council , was of the view that, (at 570-571): ... when a corporation is formed for the sole purpose of undertaking that [trading] function and undertakes none of the functions of local government which typify the activities of a municipal corporation it is ... inappropriate to describe it as a municipal corporation. 67 The High Court in Adamson , which was differently constituted from the High Court in St George County Council, departed from the purposive reasoning of the majority in St George County Council and favoured the reasoning of Barwick CJ in that case. 68 In Adamson , Barwick CJ said, at 208: The only sure guide to the nature of the company is a purview of its current activities, a judgment as to its nature being made after an overview of all those activities. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8. The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations; nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive: State Superannuation Board at 303. 73 What his Honour referred to in paragraph 3. above may have an important relevance to a ""fully fledged"" municipal corporation, like the Etheridge Shire Council, as opposed to what might be described as an ersatz municipal corporation that was the subject of consideration in the St George County Council case. 74 As a practical matter, his Honour concluded that the WACA was a trading corporation, but reached a different conclusion in relation to the Cricket Clubs. At 25, he highlighted some difficulties: Where all activities are income producing, it may not be hard to single out some as trading activities and quantify their significance, even if only in a broad way. But where some activities are income producing and others are not, the exercise is not so straightforward ... A trading activity may represent a significant part of a club's income but be relatively insignificant in an overall consideration of the club's activities. 75 This observation has a particular resonance in the present case, as will appear later. Such trading activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is quite insignificant in relation to the overall consideration of the activities of the Etheridge Shire Council, which, as a local government, exercises extensive legislative and executive functions in the local government area, and is its raison d'&ecirc;tre. 81 With respect, there is an element of circularity in this observation, but it is not consistent with the view of Barwick CJ in the St George County Council case, set out in [55] above. 82 It is to be noted that Gibbs J in the St George County Council case, said, at 561: The word ""trading"" forms part of a composite expression and indicates the essential attribute of the kind of corporation to which it refers. It is common to describe corporations according to their nature ... 83 And later, in the same paragraph: ... the words ""trading corporations"" ... in their natural meaning, as well as in the context of the placitum, refer to corporations of a particular kind. 84 Both Barwick CJ, at 543, and Gibbs J, at 561, thoroughly rejected the contention that a corporation which to any extent engages in trade is a trading corporation. 85 I therefore proceed to enquire whether the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation or a financial corporation, by considering whether, on the evidence, ""the predominant and characteristic activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is trading, whether in goods or services"", or whether ""the predominant and characteristic activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is in finance."" 86 In that enquiry, it is necessary to have regard not only to whether the predominant and characteristic activity of the Council is trading or finance, but also, as Barwick CJ indicated in St George County Council at 543, the extent of that activity and its relative significance in the affairs of the Etheridge Shire Council. 87 The Etheridge Shire Council is established by the LGA, and the powers and activities of the Etheridge Shire Council are governed by that Act. 88 The Etheridge Shire Council was established as a body corporate (in the name Einasleigh Shire Council) in accordance with the Local Government (Divisional Boards) Act 1879 (Qld) by proclamation notice of which was published in the Queensland Government Gazette dated 11 November 1879. 142 Menzies J in St George County Council , said, at 552: In Halsbury's Laws of England ... the distinction between trading and non-trading corporations is conveniently drawn and corporations having statutory powers of local government are included in the classification there appearing of non-trading corporations. It may also be observed that in 1850 James Grant in his Treatise on the Law of Corporations classified ""Municipal Corporation"" separately from trading bodies and devoted 150 pages of his book to the consideration of municipal corporations. 143 His Honour concluded, at 554: It is not my purpose to attempt to define all that falls within the limits of the classification of ""trading corporation"". Rather, I am concerned to indicate that the classification has limits and those limits are not to be ascertained simply by asking the question ""Does the corporation trade?"" As I have indicated, many corporations which do trade are clearly outside the limits of the classification and one group of corporations that is not comprehended is, in my view, corporations of an essentially different character, namely corporations for local government purposes."" 144 Mr Herbert of Counsel for the applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 drew attention to the record of the constitutional debates on 17 April 1897, at 793, where Mr Symon said, ""In the original Act corporations simply are mentioned. Why this difference?"" To which Mr Barton, later an original judge of the High Court, said: The reason of making the difference was this: It having been seen that the word ""corporations,"" as it existed, covered municipal corporations, the term was changed to ""trade corporations."" 145 In 1891, in the Constitutional debates on whether the corporations power should extend to the registration or incorporation of companies, Sir Samuel Griffiths said, at 686: I do not think we should. There are a great number of different corporations. For instance, there are municipal, trading, and charitable corporations, and these are all incorporated in different ways according to the law pertaining in different states. ... It is sometimes difficult to say what is a trading corporation. What is important, however, is that there should be uniform law for the recognition of corporations. 146 In the light of the observations by the High Court in Adamson and the later cases, in the characterisation of a corporation as a trading corporation, or a financial corporation, the primary focus has to be on the activities of the corporation. 154 I am of the view that all five judges in the St George County Council case would have determined that the Etheridge Shire Council is not a trading corporation. 155 Accepting that the ""activities test"" is the appropriate test to apply in determining whether local governments are trading corporations, the application of that test points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the Etheridge Shire Council is not a trading corporation. 156 Equally, it is not a financial corporation. The only financial activities which, on the evidence, it engages, is maintaining interest-bearing deposits of funds prior to their utilisation for the purposes of the shire council."
Case252,applied,R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190,"The majority continued at [158]: In R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] [Adamson] St George County Council was distinguished. Associations incorporated under associations incorporation legislation, whose principal objects were the promotion, control and management of Australian Rules football matches, were held to be trading corporations. Mason J said [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 at 233; [1979] HCA 6 ; 23 ALR 439 at 472]: ""Trading corporation"" is not and never has been a term of art or one having a special legal meaning. Nor, as the Chief Justice pointed out [in St George County Council ], was there a generally accepted definition of the expression in the nineteenth century. Essentially it is a description or label given to a corporation when its trading activities form a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation. 25 The majority said, at [55]: The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s 51(xx). It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. (Plainly, a foreign corporation is a corporation formed outside the limits of the Commonwealth.) No party or intervener called in question what was said about trading and financial corporations in R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] , Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 ; 40 ALR 609] , State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [(1982) [1982] HCA 72 ; 150 CLR 282 ; 44 ALR 1] or Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; [(1983) 152 CLR 570 ; 46 ALR 41]. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined.

The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3.

The majority said, at [177]: ... Particular reference need now be made only to the reasons of Gaudron J (with which Deane J agreed). Her Honour's reasoning proceeded by the following steps. [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111]. First, the business activities of corporations formed within Australia signify whether they are trading or financial corporations, and the main purpose of the power to legislate with respect to foreign corporations must be directed to their business activities in Australia. Second, it follows that the power conferred by s 51(xx) extends ""at the very least"" [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111] to the business functions and activities of constitutional corporations and to their business relationships.

A law which prescribes norms regulating the relationship between constitutional corporations and their employees, or affecting constitutional corporations in the manner considered and upheld in Fontana Films or, as Gaudron J said in Re Pacific Coal, [2000] HCA 34 ; [(2000) 203 CLR 346 at 375 [83] ; [2000] HCA 34 ; 172 ALR 257 at 275] ""laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of [constitutional] corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations"" are laws with respect to constitutional corporations. 20 In essence, the High Court, by a majority, concluded that the Work Choices Act was valid in its application to constitutional corporations. The central question in these two proceedings is whether the Etheridge Shire Council is such a corporation. 21 If it is, the acceptance by the majority in the Work Choices Case of the ambit of the power of the Commonwealth under s 51(xx) as described by Gaudron J in Pacific Coal , would mean that the Commonwealth has power to regulate the activities, functions, relationships and the business of the Etheridge Shire Council; the creation of rights and privileges belonging to the Etheridge Shire Council; the imposition of obligations on it; and, in respect of those matters, the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts, its employees, and also the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities, functions, relationships or business."

The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8. The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations; nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive: State Superannuation Board at 303. 147 I note, nonetheless, that in the State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 , Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ said, at 303: ... [T]he decision in Adamson is of importance for two reasons. First, the majority of the Court (Barwick CJ, Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ), rejecting the argument that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is the sole or principal criterion of its character as a trading corporation. 148 This passage indicates that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is not the ""sole"" or ""principal"" criterion for the purposes of characterisation. The passage suggests, however, that the purpose of the formation of a corporation is not irrelevant in that process. 149 The contention for the applicant in both proceedings in this case is that when one looks at the totality of the evidence, including the historical evidence concerning the function of the Etheridge Shire Council, in particular, the fundamental functions of the shire council, being the legislative and administrative responsibility as a local government for the local government area, it is impossible to conclude that the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation. 150 I have set out in detail the evidence in relation to what is said to be the trading activities of the council. 151 All of them, in my opinion, including even the road works aspect of the activity of the council, after close analysis, entirely lack the essential quality of trade. Almost all of them run at a loss. They are all directed, in my view, to public benefit objectives within the shire. Their scale, even in monetary terms (putting to one side the non-monetary significance of the legislative and executive activity of the shire council), are so inconsequential and incidental to the primary activity and function of the Council as to the deny to the Council the characterisation of a ""trading corporation"" or a ""financial corporation""."
Case256,cited,United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (1998) 83 FCR 346,"Those submissions also referred to decisions in the Federal Court and other superior courts. Those cases were concerned with entities such as charities: E v Australian Red Cross Society [1991] FCA 20 ; (1991) 27 FCR 310 ; statutory corporations set up under State legislation which conduct various business activities: United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (1998) 83 FCR 346 ; corporations that conduct universities: Quickenden v O'Connor [2001] FCA 303 ; (2001) 109 FCR 243 ; and schools: Educang Limited v Queensland Industrial Relations Commission (2006) 154 IR 436; yachting organisations: Forbes &amp; Anor v Australian Yachting Federation Inc.

(a) It is undoubtedly a fact of fact and degree (Adamson at 234); (b) A measurement of what is received from the alleged trading activities against total receipts as an indication of substantiality and significance has been accepted and adopted in a number of cases including:- (i) E v Red Cross [1991] FCA 20 ; (1991) 27 FCR 310 at 345; (ii) United Firefighters Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (1998) 83 FCR 346 at 351; (iii) Orion Pet Products v RSPCA [2002] FCA 860 ; (2002) 120 FCR 191 at 219; (iv) Quickenden v O'Connor [2001] FCA 303 ; (2001) 109 FCR 243 at 272 and 273."
Case257,considered,Widgee Shire Council v Bonney [1907] HCA 11 ; (1907) 4 CLR 977,"The High Court, in Widgee Shire Council v Bonney [1907] HCA 11 ; (1907) 4 CLR 977 , upheld the validity of a power granted to the Widgee Shire Council, which was a local authority in a country district, to make by-laws made for the protection of roads under their control. In doing so, Griffith CJ said, at 983: In my opinion, the legislature has deliberately and intentionally made the local authority, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, the sole judge of such matters, subject only to this qualification, that, if a by-law is such that no reasonable man, exercising in good faith the powers conferred by the Statute, could under any circumstances pass such a by-law, it might be held invalid on that ground as being an abuse of the power, and therefore not within it. 44 The Etheridge Shire Council has numerous other powers and responsibilities under the LGA, including making a local law which creates an offence constituted by contravening a local law and fixing a penalty for an offence against a local law: s 26 of the LGA. 45 Having regard to the submissions of counsel for all the parties, it is plain that if the Etheridge Shire Council is not a constitutional corporation, then each of the applicants is entitled to the relief which it seeks."
Case258,considered,Wingadee Shire Council v Willis [1910] HCA 35 ; (1910) 11 CLR 123,"Of these powers conferred by the LGA, it is worth noting that in Wingadee Shire Council v Willis [1910] HCA 35 ; (1910) 11 CLR 123 , Barton J, at 136, cited with approval the following passage of the judgment of Field J in the United States Supreme Court case of Meriwether v Garrett [1880] USSC 120 ; 102 US, 472 at 511: Municipal corporations are mere instrumentalities of the State for the more convenient administration of local government. Their powers are such as the legislature may confer, and these may be enlarged, abridged or entirely withdrawn at its pleasure."

Beaumont J, who dissented in the Full Court, expressly approved that order (at 40,509). It was supported by the authorities referred to by Burchett J.

Whether such an order should be made is for the discretion of the Court in each case."
Case264,considered,Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358,"And finally, there are observations by Heerey J in Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 , which are apposite in the context of the affidavit material filed in the present application. Heerey J said of the case before him at [17]: ... Mr Meyers has filed a substantial amount of affidavit material sworn by himself and others. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the issue is not whether his version of events is more plausible than Andi-Co's, but whether the alleged debts are the subject of genuine disputes and whether the alleged offsetting claims are genuine, that is to say, real and authentic as opposed to false, illegitimate, phoney, counterfeit and false. Accordingly, I shall not engage in an assessment of the rival merits. 18 The plaintiff asserts two offsetting claims. The first of the offsetting claims relates to what is said to be a genuine claim of the plaintiff against the defendant for the infringement of three patents, arising out of the defendant's manufacture and sale of water meter assemblies. 19 The second offsetting claim relates to an order for costs made in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant by me on 9 August 2004 in action Q69 of 2003."

Case266,considered,Fleur De Lys Pty Ltd v Jarrett (2004) 51 ACSR 238,"Such an order was made by Hely J in Fleur De Lys Pty Ltd v Jarrett (2004) 51 ACSR 238. 56 The application by the plaintiff seeks an order for costs on an indemnity basis, relying on the fact that its solicitor had corresponded with the solicitor for the defendant indicating that the plaintiff claimed that it had a cross demand for damages for infringement of patents. The defendant nonetheless persisted in resisting the setting aside of the statutory demand. 57 In my opinion, it is not appropriate that there be an order for costs on an indemnity basis."
Case267,considered,Gujarat NRE Australia v Williams [2006] NSWSC 518,"Austin J in Gujarat NRE Australia v Williams [2006] NSWSC 518 said: [20] Effectively, the standard to be reached to persuade a court that there is an offsetting claim is the same as the standard to be reached to persuade a court that there is a genuine dispute between the alleged debtor and the party claiming to be creditor. The most effective cited description of the standard for establishing a genuine dispute is a passage in the judgment of McLelland CJ in Eq in Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 at 787. There, his Honour said that the expression ""genuine dispute"" connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of considerations as the ""serious question to be tried"" criterion which arises in an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal of a caveat. [21] It is of fundamental importance for parties to proceedings of this kind to understand that the court does not enter into the merits of any dispute between the parties. The court merely satisfies itself, to the standard described by McLelland CJ in Eq, that the dispute, or the assertion of an offsetting claim, is ""genuine"". If it is, then the statutory demand procedure is out of place. The whole purpose of the reforms introduced to corporate insolvency law, when the present Pt 5.4 was introduced, was to remove litigation about disputed claims from the winding up process. That is why courts have said, time and again, that if a creditor is aware that there is a dispute, asserted on behalf of the alleged debtor with sufficient plausibility to meet that relatively low threshold described by his Honour, issuing a statutory demand is wholly inappropriate. The correct course is to have the dispute resolved by proceedings asserting the debt."
Case268,applied,Intag Microelectronics Pty Ltd v AWA Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 284,"Having regard to the expert evidence of Mr Fox, the claims are, it seems to me, genuine claims put forward in good faith, and which are more than mere assertion. The claims are seriously disputed, as the expert evidence of Mr Collins demonstrates. Without looking too deeply at the issues of validity and infringement, the claims of the plaintiff in respect of damages for infringement are such that they have "" some real chance of success "", to use the words of Young J in Intag Microelectronics Pty Ltd v AWA Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 284 at 289. 41 In my opinion, the conclusion that there is an offsetting claim in respect of the costs orders made by the Court on 9 August 2004 are even stronger. 42 On that day, the Court ordered that the decision of the AAT to affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Patents to decline an extension of time was set aside, and the matter was remitted to the AAT for consideration according to law. The Court ordered that the second respondent pay the costs of the applicant to be taxed if not agreed."
Case269,considered,Macleay Nominees Pty Ltd v Belle Property East Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 743,"Palmer J in Macleay Nominees Pty Ltd v Belle Property East Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 743 at [18] said: In my opinion, a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of CA s 459H (1) and (2) means a claim on a cause of action advanced in good faith, for an amount claimed in good faith. 'Good faith' means arguable on the basis of facts asserted with sufficient particularity to enable the Court to determine that the claim is not fanciful. In a claim for unliquidated damages for economic loss, the Court will not be able to determine whether the amount claimed is claimed in good faith unless the plaintiff adduces some evidence to show the basis upon which the loss is said to arise and how that loss is calculated. If such evidence is entirely lacking, the Court cannot find that there is a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of s 459H."
Case270,considered,Mibor Investments Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1993) 11 ACSR 362,"The expression "" genuine claim "" was considered by Hayne J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Mibor Investments Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1993) 11 ACSR 362, where his Honour said: ... any application to set aside a statutory demand must be made very quickly; it must be made within 21 days. Second, the statute contemplates a summary procedure, the only outcome of which will be an order affecting the statutory demand, not an order or judgment declaring a debt to be owing or not to be owing or ordering payment of any money sum. Third, the only significance that the statutory demand has is that if there is a failure to comply with it then the company is deemed to be insolvent. Thus the demand is no more than a precursor to an application for winding up in insolvency. Fourth, an application to wind up in insolvency must be determined within 6 months (unless the court is satisfied that special circumstances justify an extension of that time): s 459R. Firth, on the hearing of the application to wind up, the company may not oppose the application on grounds that it might have taken in any application to set aside the demand, unless those grounds are material to proving that the company is solvent. 11 Hayne J then said: These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases, it is not expected that the court will embark upon any extended inquiry in order to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and certainly will not attempt to weigh the merits of that dispute. All that the legislation requires is that the court conclude that there is a dispute and that it is a genuine dispute."
Case271,considered,Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACSR 601,"To like effect are the observations of Thomas J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACSR 601, where his Honour said at 605-606: There is little doubt that Division 3 is intended to be a complete code which prescribes a formula that requires the Court to assess the position between the parties and preserve demands where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine offsetting claim. That is not to say that the Court will examine the merits or settle the dispute. The specified limits of the Court's examination are the ascertainment of whether there is a ""genuine dispute"" and whether there is a ""genuine claim""."

Case273,cited,Stack v Brisbane City Council (1999) 47 IPR 525,"Litigation involving those petty patents in the Federal Court [(1999) 47 IPR 525] resulted in the plaintiff losing on the issue of entitlement, Cooper J otherwise being satisfied that the invention was a manner of new manufacture and was also novel, inventive, and useful. 28 Mr Fox says: 5. GST [the plaintiff] is also the Patentee of three more recent patents (""the three new patents"") which also derive from application No. 85236/91 as divisional either directly or indirectly, those patents being No. 780782 (32815/95), No. 781173 (46033/01), and No. 781174 (43779/01) and all three new patents relate to the same ""invention"" as the two petty patents previously mentioned. In fact, the claims of patent No: 781174 are identical to the claims of one of the petty patents, namely, No: 645740. The claims of patent No: 781173 are identical to the claims of the other petty patent, namely, No: 662284. 29 The tenor of his evidence is that those commercially sold water meter assemblies infringe the patents of the plaintiff."
Case274,cited,Applicant Y v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2005] FCAFC 222,"The power given to the Court under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act to forbid or restrict the publication of evidence should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. Section 50 makes it clear that the power should only be exercised in order to prevent ""prejudice to the administration of justice or the security of the Commonwealth"". In the present case ASIC's concerns relate to prejudice to the administration of justice. It is a fundamental principle of the administration of justice in Australia that the administration of justice be open justice. When considering whether to exercise the power given by s 50 a Court must bear in mind the need to do justice between all relevant parties, taking as its initial position the principle of open justice. The manner in which a Court should approach an application under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act to restrict the publication of evidence was considered by a Full Court of the Federal Court in Applicant Y v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2005] FCAFC 222. The Full Court said at pars [14] and [15]: ""The public interest, that the Court should effectively endeavour to achieve in considering the exercise of power under s 50, is the object of doing justice between the parties. That is the function that the Court is appointed to discharge. Where refusal to make an order might well undermine or defeat the purpose of achieving justice between the parties, and disappoint the public interest in having the Court deal responsibly with the affairs of citizens, it may be appropriate to make an order pursuant to s 50 ... The Court must, however, take into account what s 50 does not explicitly state, but is the underlying assumption upon which it is based, namely, the principle of open justice. The importance of the principle of open justice is not in doubt. On the other hand, the possibility of prejudice to the administration of justice must be weighed against the public interest in maintaining open justice. Although the principle of open justice is of great importance in exercising the discretion under s 50, it is not necessarily the whole weight of that principle that must be placed on the scales. The derogation from the principle that might be involved in making an order under s 50 may be very great, or it might be very small. The degree of derogation from the principle involved in the proposed order is an important matter to be considered in balancing the principle against possible prejudice to the administration of justice ...""

Case275,cited,Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417,"The basis upon which the Court should approach an application under s 17(4) of the Federal Court of Australia Act is similar to the approach it should take in relation to an application under s 50. The power to order the exclusion of persons from a hearing should only be exercised in exceptional cases. It is clear from s 17(4) that that power should only be exercised in circumstances where not to exercise it would be ""contrary to the interests of justice"". The primary principle is that the principle of open justice is to be observed in that Court hearings should be open to the public and only closed where the interests of justice require that closure. As Earl Loreburn said in Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 445: ""The inveterate rule is that justice shall be administered in open Court."" His Lordship accepted that it was appropriate in the interests of justice that the doors of the Court be closed when the subject-matter of the action would be destroyed by a hearing in open court."
Case276,cited,Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones [1985] 2 NSWLR 47,"In Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones [1985] 2 NSWLR 47, Kirby P (as he then was) said at 55: ""Many cases report the scrutiny by courts of statutory provisions designed to derogate from the open administration of justice. Running through these decisions is a common theme. It is that, by our tradition, the open administration of justice is the rule. Statutory derogation from openness is the exception. In the defence of the rule, such statutes will usually be strictly and narrowly construed. Unless the derogation is specifically provided for, courts are loathe to expand the field of secret justice ..."" Samuels JA, in the course of analysing whether the publication of the names in suit would defeat the ends of justice, said at 61: ""The inquiry must start with the proposition, central to our notions of forensic procedure, that the courts customarily conduct their business in public in order that the integrity, fairness and efficiency of the system, and its administrators, may be maintained by its exposure to public scrutiny."" 22 The applicant submitted that ASIC should disclose in open hearing what was the reasoning process to support the protection of the information sought by ASIC without disclosing what that information was. It submitted that it should, to the extent possible, identify the reasons why the information was being withheld without disclosing the information. The difficulty with acceding to that submission is that exposing the reasoning process would inevitably disclose the information sought to be protected. There were also a number of matters in respect of the claim for public interest immunity privilege raised in the confidential material which I wanted to discuss with counsel for ASIC but it was not possible to do this in open session without exposing the information that ASIC sought to protect. 23 The difficulty with which I was faced in this application by ASIC was that in order to determine whether orders should be made under ss 17(4) and 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act I must have regard to the confidential affidavits (not served on the parties) filed by ASIC and its confidential submissions (not served on the parties) in order to understand the basis for the application. I reached the conclusion that in order to preserve the subject-matter of ASIC's claim for public interest immunity privilege I was compelled to make orders under ss 17(4) and 50 of the Federal Court Act in order to avoid prejudice to the administration of justice. If I had not made such orders I would have destroyed the basis for ASIC's claim. The hearing of ASIC's claim in the presence of the parties to the proceeding would have disclosed the very subject-matter and issues which ASIC claimed were protected from disclosure by the public interest immunity privilege. I therefore heard ASIC's application in camera in the absence of the parties to the proceeding."

Case280,cited,Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347-352,"Applying those principles, in my opinion the Work Trial Agreement in the form sent by Mr Mihelcic to Mr Sutczak on 30 December 1996, including cl 4 set out in [18] above, formed part of the contract which was in force at the time Mr Fowle suffered his injury. The Commonwealth and Comcare by their subsequent conduct, and in particular by meeting all Mr Fowle's wages notwithstanding that he was doing work for the Hydro, impliedly accepted the terms in the Work Trial Agreement. Pre-contractual conduct can cast light on the genesis of the contract and its objective aim: Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347-352 , Brambles at [24]. Here the essence of the term appeared in the original Work Trial Agreement ([11] above), which had been prepared by the Commonwealth. Subsequently the Hydro, through Mr Sutczak, emphasised the importance of indemnity ([17] above). The potential for workplace injury, and liability there for, was an obvious matter of concern for a substantial industrial employer like the Hydro. 30 The ""liability"" in question, a potential liability which might arise at some time in the future, must be the liability of the host employer, the Hydro. ""Liability"" means any legal liability of the Hydro. Obviously ""any injury"" does not mean literally any injury suffered by Mr Fowle. An injury which he suffered at home and unconnected with his work would not involve any liability of the Hydro. 31 The expression ""liability for any injury"" cannot be limited, as the defendants argued, to exclude common law liability. The words are not qualified in any way. It would have been open to Comcare and/or APS, as the preparer of the document, to limit it to accord with their particular circumstances. It is not to the point that entitlement of a Commonwealth employee to sue the Commonwealth for damages at common law is limited in scope and amount by s 45 of the SRC Act. At all relevant times the potential liability of the Hydro included liability at common law for negligence. The Hydro enjoyed no statutory protection comparable to that in s 45 of the Commonwealth Act."

Case284,considered,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"I do not think the orders made by the Tribunal which are under challenge constitute a decision under s 44(1) of the AAT Act. The substantive application before the Tribunal was an application for review of the delegate's decision under s 13 of the Act not to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to the respondent. The right to bring the application for review is contained in s 52A of the Act. The orders of the Tribunal defer or adjourn consideration of the application for review. The orders do not amount to a final decision or determination. In accordance with well-established authority the orders therefore do not constitute a decision within s 44(1) of the AAT Act: Director-General of Social Services v Chaney (1980) 3 ALD 161 per Deane J, with whom Fisher J agreed, at 178, 180; Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (' Bond ') per Mason CJ at 335; Geographical Indications Committee v The Honourable Justice O'Connor (2000) 64 ALD 325 at 332-333. In my opinion, there is no right of appeal from the Tribunal's orders under s 44(1) of the AAT Act. 30 I do not think the orders made by the Tribunal constitute a decision under s 5 of the ADJR Act. The meaning of 'decision' in s 5 of the ADJR Act was considered by Mason CJ in Bond . His Honour said that a reviewable decision under s 5 of the ADJR Act had a number of characteristics, including the fact that it must be a substantive determination. His Honour said (at 337-338): 'Another essential quality of a reviewable decision is that it be a substantive determination. With the exception of s 3(2)(g), the instances of decision mentioned in s 3(2) are all substantive in character. Moreover, the provisions in sub-ss (1), (2), (3) and (5) of s 3 point to a substantive determination. In this context the reference in s 3(2)(g) to ""doing or refusing to do any other act or thing "" (emphasis added) should be read as referring to the exercise or refusal to exercise a substantive power. I do not perceive in s 16(1)(b) or in par (e) of Sched 1 or par (a) of Sched 2 to the AD(JR) Act any contrary implication. These exclusions from the AD(JR) Act or from s 13 appear to have been introduced for more abundant caution and it would be unwise to take too much from them. If ""decision"" were to embrace procedural determinations, then there would be little scope for review of ""conduct"", a concept which appears to be essentially procedural in character. To take an example, the refusal by a decision-maker of an application for an adjournment in the course of an administrative hearing would not constitute a reviewable decision, being a procedural matter not resolving a substantive issue and lacking the quality of finality. Then it is the ""conduct"" of the hearing in refusing an adjournment that is the subject of review. To treat the refusal of the adjournment in this way is more consistent with the concept of ""conduct"" than with the notion of ""decision under an enactment"".' 31 The applicant submitted that the order deferring or adjourning the application for review was conduct for the purpose of making a decision. It seems to me that that is probably the case, but the question which then arises is whether any of the grounds in s 6 of the ADJR Act are relevant to the grounds upon which the applicant challenges the orders. A number of the grounds, although not all of them, relate to the proposed decision which in this case is the decision to be made on the application for review either to affirm the decision of the delegate or to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to the applicant. If necessary, I will give the parties the opportunity to make further submissions with respect to this issue. 32 It may not be necessary for the parties to make further submissions because I have also reached the conclusion that this is an appropriate case for relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The respondent did not argue that relief under s 39B was not, in theory, available. He submitted that it was not available in this case because there was no jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. For the reasons set out below I reject that submission and hold that the Tribunal erred in a manner going to its jurisdiction. The respondent submitted that the Court would rarely exercise its discretion to issue constitutional writs in relation to a decision by the Tribunal to defer or adjourn an application for review. I agree with that as a general statement, but I think that this is an appropriate case. The Tribunal has erred in concluding that it could exercise the power in s 14A of the Act and it has erred in its consideration of its general power to adjourn in light of the provisions of the Act and, in particular, s 13(11)(a). 33 As I have said, before me both parties submitted that the power to defer in s 14A(1) was a power available to the Tribunal. The section in the AAT Act which confers various powers and discretions of the primary decision-maker on the Tribunal is s 43. It seems appropriate to interpret s 43(1) broadly and proceed on the basis that for the purpose of the subsection the Tribunal would be exercising the power to defer 'for the purpose of reviewing [the] application'. The power to defer is a power available to the Tribunal. It is a power which is subject to a limitation and any exercise of the power by the Tribunal is subject to the same limitation. What is the meaning of the limitation? First, I think the twelve-month period commences from the time the decision to defer is taken. With respect, I reject the view of the Tribunal member that it commences when the offence which is the subject of the charge was allegedly committed. There is no warrant in the section for identifying that as the commencement point. Secondly, I think that it is only possible to defer for a maximum period of twelve months and it is not possible to defer for twelve months on the basis of one charge or set of charges and then later for a further period of up to twelve months on the basis of a second and later charge or set of charges. The terms of the section are such that a deferral or deferrals of consideration of the application for review for longer than twelve months is not permitted. In my opinion, the words of the section are such that if the power to defer is exercised, consideration of the application for review must at least commence within a period of twelve months thereafter. 34 The Tribunal's general power to adjourn is not excluded by the fact that the power to defer is a power available to the Tribunal. The Tribunal is not bound to exercise the power to defer in s 14A. In any event, there is a clear difference between a statutory power to defer an application for review and a power to adjourn an application for review and there may be many reasons for adjourning an application which are unrelated to the matters referred to in s 14(1)(b) of the Act. The Tribunal might adjourn because of the unavailability of a party or witness or for any of the reasons that routinely lead to adjournments of a proceeding before a court or tribunal. 35 However, the general power to adjourn is affected by the provisions of the Act. First, if an application is made to adjourn or defer an application for review on the ground that a charge is pending, it would be appropriate that the decision-maker proceed under s 14A rather than the general power to adjourn in s 40(1). Secondly, and in any event, I doubt that there would be grounds to adjourn because of a pending charge. I say that because the alternative to the granting of an adjournment would not be that the applicant for review would be required to compromise his or her right to silence before the hearing of the criminal charge. The effect of s 13(11)(a) of the Act is quite clear. The decision-maker must not grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to a person while proceedings for a relevant offence are pending in relation to that person. It is not clear what the Tribunal member meant when he said that s 13(11)(a) operated as a prohibition on the exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal on review. Certainly the Tribunal could not grant a certificate of Australian citizenship, but it could list the matter for hearing and find that the facts fall within s 13(11)(a) and that it cannot or should not exercise the power in s 14A and, having reached those conclusions, dismiss the application for review and affirm the decision of the delegate. I turn now to apply these principles to the facts of this case. 36 The Tribunal member erred in concluding that the power in s 14A could, in the circumstances, be exercised by him. It is not entirely clear from the direction (see [12] above) what power the Tribunal member considered he was exercising on 8 September 2004 when he directed that the matter not be listed for hearing until after the resolution of the criminal charges. I think it is appropriate to view it as an exercise of the power to defer in s 14A because, for the reasons I have given, it would not have been a proper exercise of the discretion to adjourn the application on the ground referred to in the direction. What that means is that the power in s 14A was spent because consideration of the application did not at least commence within twelve months of 8 September 2004. 37 The exercise by the Tribunal of its general power to adjourn miscarried because it was not entitled to take into account the pending charge in considering whether to adjourn and, in any event, the Tribunal member misunderstood what would occur if the application was not adjourned. If not adjourned, then the application should have been listed and if the facts fell within s 13(11)(a) it should have been dismissed and the delegate's decision affirmed. 38 The applicant is entitled to relief, but I will give the parties leave to make further submissions as to the appropriate relief in light of these reasons.

Case287,distinguished,Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor (1988) 88 ALR 63,"PCR has submitted that it is not the true 'aggressor' in the present application and relies upon the decision of Wilcox J in Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor (1988) 88 ALR 63 (' Amalgamated Mining '). In those proceedings Amalgamated Mining sought a declaration that statements contained in a letter from Warman's solicitors alleging that Warman's copyright had been breached by Amalgamated Mining's supplier were unjustified. In deciding that Amalgamated Mining should not be required to pay security for costs, Wilcox J said (at 67-8): 'If one applies the homely test adopted by Scrutton LJ [in Maatschappij Voor Fondsenbezit v Shell Transport and Trading Co and Ors [1923] 2 KB 166] of asking who, in the litigation, was the attacker and who was the defender, I think it must be said that the first attack came in the letter from [Warman's solicitors] . Although the letter was not written directly to Amalgamated Mining, it is that company which has an interest in defending and, in a commercial sense, probably has very little alternative other than to take that course. I think that it is an accurate analysis of the matter to say, therefore, that it is the respondents to the principal proceeding who are the attackers and that Amalgamated Mining is, in substance, the defender.' His Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Willey v Synan [1935] HCA 76 ; (1935) 54 CLR 175. 31 I consider the facts of the present case to be different from those in Amalgamated Mining and Willey v Synan . Those were both cases in which proceedings had been instigated to forestall a threat by a respondent to existing entitlements of the applicant. In these proceedings the respondents have not threatened existing rights of PCR. PCR does not have any specific entitlement to the licence. Although it is true that the decision of ACMA has led to PCR being unable to operate its radio station, PCR only ever held a temporary licence and never had an ongoing right to operate. It cannot be said that the action of either respondent deprived, or threatened to deprive, PCR of its rights such that it was forced to bring these proceedings to protect itself. Accordingly I do not consider that PCR can reasonably be construed as ' the party attacked ' in these proceedings, or that either of the respondents can be considered as the true attacker. 32 PCR also submits that GCB is joined only as an interested party, and not as an 'adversary' to PCR. PCR refers to the fact that no relief is sought against GCB specifically, and says that GCB was only joined in the present proceedings because Wilcox J had required its joinder in the previous litigation. PCR also refers to the fact that, despite the fact that PCR was successful before Wilcox J, GCB was not required to pay PCR's costs, which it submits recognised GCB's non-adversarial status in the proceedings. The submission is that GCB, although joined, has no real need to participate in these proceedings because no relief is claimed against it."
Case288,considered,Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463,"The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts: see The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400 at [18] (' Airtourer '). As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463 at 469: 'It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs. In Pearson v. Naydler [1977] 1 W.L.R. 899, Megarry V-C said: ""The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs, however poor he is, is ancient and well-established. As Bowen L.J. said in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch. D. 34 at 38, both at law and in equity 'the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant'. The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts.""' However, as Branson J noted in Airtourer at [21]: 'Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant. An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious. An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant.'"
Case289,considered,Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1,"In an often-cited passage of the Full Federal Court, Sheppard, Morling and Neaves JJ in Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 said at 4: 'In our opinion a court is not justified in declining to order security on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation unless a company in the position of the appellant here establishes that those who stand behind it and who will benefit from the litigation if it is successful (whether they be shareholders or creditors or, as in this case, beneficiaries under a trust) are also without means. It is not for the party seeking security to raise the matter; it is an essential part of the case of a company seeking to resist an order for security on the ground that the granting of security will frustrate the litigation to raise the issue of the impecuniosity of those whom the litigation will benefit and to prove the necessary facts.' 23 The fact that PCR has chosen to oppose the application without providing adequate evidence of its financial position poses a difficulty for the Court. However, given the evidence that PCR is a not-for-profit organisation managed by volunteers, I think it is reasonable to infer that those supporters will not benefit from the litigation in any pecuniary sense, especially since these proceedings seek administrative law remedies rather than damages."
Case290,referred to,Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301,"The application by GCB has been promptly brought, having been filed one day after the first return date for the application. PCR submitted that the motion was premature, because the leave application had not yet been heard. I see no reason why GCB should have waited until after the leave application before bringing its application for security for costs. Had it done so, it would have been open to PCR to submit that GCB had delayed in bringing an application for security for costs, by reason of which expenses had been incurred in prosecuting the application: see Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308; Gartner v Ernst &amp; Young (No 3) [2003] FCA 1437 at [34] .

This is not a case where PCR is being used as a ' stalking horse to enable someone else to evade personal responsibility ': see Cameron's Unit Services Pty Ltd and Anor v Kevin R Whelpton &amp; Associates (Australia) Pty Ltd and Anor (1986) 13 FCR 46 at 53.
Case292,referred to,Chang v Comcare Australia [1999] FCA 1677,"This passage accords with the comments of Moore J in Chang v Comcare Australia [1999] FCA 1677 at [25] where his Honour said: 'While impecuniosity is not, by itself, sufficient to warrant an order for security, it is generally a relevant consideration ...' 14 Several of the factors outlined above have relevance to the facts of the present case. 15 GCB submitted that PCR's claim was unlikely to succeed since it was brought out of time and was an appeal against a decision made by ACMA on remitter from a successful appeal by PCR to this Court. GCB said that after ACMA's initial decision was set aside, ACMA was concerned to ensure that the process for the award of the licence was thorough and complete and that for this reason PCR's challenge is likely to fail."
Case293,considered,Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 496,"Several authorities of this and other courts have considered the factors which should be taken into account in a security for costs application: see for example Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation &amp; Ors (1989) ATPR 40-972 per Hill J; KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd and Ors (1995) 56 FCR 189 at 197-8 per Beazley J; Cultivaust Pty Ltd v Grain Pool Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1366 at [13] per Finn J; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 496 at [13] per Tamberlin J (' Chapman v Luminis '); Croker v Sydney Institute of TAFE (State of New South Wales) [2003] FCA 942 per Bennett J. In summary, those considerations are: 1) the chances of success of the applicant and whether the claim is bona fide; 2) the risk that the applicant could not satisfy a costs order; 3) whether the application for security for costs has been promptly brought; 4) whether the application for security for costs is being used oppressively to deny an impecunious litigant access to the court; 5) whether the applicant's impecuniosity arises out of the act in respect of which relief is sought; 6) whether there are third parties standing behind the applicant who are likely to benefit from the litigation and if so, whether they have proffered security for the costs of the litigation; 7) whether an order for security for costs would frustrate the litigation; 8) whether there are any public interest considerations to be taken into account; 9) any matters relevant to the discretion which are distinctive to the circumstances of the case. 16 I am unable at this early stage of proceedings to form a conclusion concerning the merits of the application. As Tamberlin J said in Chapman v Luminis at [17]: 'It is neither possible nor appropriate on a security for costs application to reach any firm conclusions as to the prospects of an appeal being successful beyond a general consideration of the reasons for decision and the formation of a general overview.' 17 Although the appeal is from a decision by ACMA rather than from a decision of this Court, I consider Tamberlin J's observations are pertinent. The notice of appeal in these proceedings makes numerous challenges to the decision-making process engaged in by ACMA, and I am not able to assess the merits of those challenges without investigating factual material. The fact that the appellant's challenge relates to the second decision of ACMA does not give rise to the inference that the appeal will not succeed. 18 PCR has not provided any direct evidence to the Court with respect to its incorporation, office-bearers, or financial position, although in its oral submissions it made brief reference to the fact that it was impecunious. The only evidence relating to the current financial status of PCR is the statement contained in the affidavit of Mr Norbert Lindberg, secretary of PCR, that the delay by PCR in bringing proceedings has resulted, in part, from the need to raise funds to finance the litigation. The Court has no information with respect to the success of PCR's fundraising activities and no recent financial statements have been produced. The Court has been provided with financial statements from 2003-2004 but because PCR was still operating the radio station and was in receipt of community grants at this time, the statements provide very little guidance as to the current finances of PCR. Since early 2004 PCR, because of the loss of its broadcasting licence, has not been eligible for the community grants which has presumably had an adverse effect on its financial position."

In these circumstances, although no relief is sought against GCB, its position is threatened by the relief sought by PCR. GCB's role is not akin to an 'observer' having no active role. Accordingly it is entitled to defend these proceedings and to seek security for its costs in so defending them."
Case302,considered,The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400,"The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts: see The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400 at [18] (' Airtourer '). As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463 at 469: 'It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs. In Pearson v. Naydler [1977] 1 W.L.R. 899, Megarry V-C said: ""The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs, however poor he is, is ancient and well-established. As Bowen L.J. said in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch. D. 34 at 38, both at law and in equity 'the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant'. The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts.""' However, as Branson J noted in Airtourer at [21]: 'Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant. An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious. An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant.' 27 I consider that the circumstances of the present case are, despite some similarities, also distinguishable from those considered by Branson J in Airtourer . That case involved an impecunious co-operative which was pursuing litigation out of a limited pool of funds. There was evidence before her Honour that the applicant planned to exhaust its funds to meet its own legal costs, leaving no funds in reserve for any costs order made against it. Branson J commented at [27]: 'I do not conclude that an order requiring the applicant to provide a relatively modest sum by way of security for costs would preclude the applicant from pursuing its application to the Court. It might require the directors of the applicant to request additional funds from members of the applicant but, as the proceeding is presumably being pursued by the applicant in the interests of its members, I see nothing inappropriate in such an outcome.' 28 Since PCR is a not-for-profit organisation which aims to provide radio broadcasts serving youth and ethnic minority groups, the proceedings are not being pursued by PCR in the interests of its 'members' so much as in the interests of the wider community group which it serves. I am not satisfied that volunteer members of a not-for-profit organisation should be required to provide funds for litigation when the organisation is impecunious. To impose such a requirement would mean a not-for-profit community organisation with a history of providing services to the public, which was legitimately bringing proceedings to the Court, might be prevented from pursuing an action to protect its interests merely on the ground of impecuniosity. This would, in my opinion, breach the principle that impecuniosity should not, without more, prevent a litigant from accessing the courts. 29 However, the difficulty which remains in this instance is that, because PCR has provided very limited information with respect to its financial status, members, objectives, any possible sources of funding and other relevant details, no conclusive finding can be made on the evidence as to the effect which an order for security for costs may have in these proceedings. Further, in the absence of a direct submission from PCR that the proceedings would be stifled if an order were made, I am unwilling to draw the inference that this consequence would follow."
Case303,distinguished,Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 673,"A further consideration is that PCR is not a mere nominal applicant. In this sense, the present facts are distinguishable from those considered by Hely J in Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 673, in which the applicant had no private right or interest. Hely J observed in that case at [37]: 'In my view, the fact that no private right or special interest of the applicant is involved in these proceedings is a factor which weighs in favour of making an order for security, rather than against it.' 25 His Honour added at [38]: 'If those who control the applicant wish to have the benefit of litigating when no private right or special interest of the applicant is at stake in the proceedings and when the applicant is impecunious, then it is appropriate that security for the respondent's costs be provided.'"
Case304,distinguished,Willey v Synan [1935] HCA 76 ; (1935) 54 CLR 175,"PCR has submitted that it is not the true 'aggressor' in the present application and relies upon the decision of Wilcox J in Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor (1988) 88 ALR 63 (' Amalgamated Mining '). In those proceedings Amalgamated Mining sought a declaration that statements contained in a letter from Warman's solicitors alleging that Warman's copyright had been breached by Amalgamated Mining's supplier were unjustified. In deciding that Amalgamated Mining should not be required to pay security for costs, Wilcox J said (at 67-8): 'If one applies the homely test adopted by Scrutton LJ [in Maatschappij Voor Fondsenbezit v Shell Transport and Trading Co and Ors [1923] 2 KB 166] of asking who, in the litigation, was the attacker and who was the defender, I think it must be said that the first attack came in the letter from [Warman's solicitors] . Although the letter was not written directly to Amalgamated Mining, it is that company which has an interest in defending and, in a commercial sense, probably has very little alternative other than to take that course. I think that it is an accurate analysis of the matter to say, therefore, that it is the respondents to the principal proceeding who are the attackers and that Amalgamated Mining is, in substance, the defender.' His Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Willey v Synan [1935] HCA 76 ; (1935) 54 CLR 175. 31 I consider the facts of the present case to be different from those in Amalgamated Mining and Willey v Synan . Those were both cases in which proceedings had been instigated to forestall a threat by a respondent to existing entitlements of the applicant. In these proceedings the respondents have not threatened existing rights of PCR. PCR does not have any specific entitlement to the licence. Although it is true that the decision of ACMA has led to PCR being unable to operate its radio station, PCR only ever held a temporary licence and never had an ongoing right to operate. It cannot be said that the action of either respondent deprived, or threatened to deprive, PCR of its rights such that it was forced to bring these proceedings to protect itself. Accordingly I do not consider that PCR can reasonably be construed as ' the party attacked ' in these proceedings, or that either of the respondents can be considered as the true attacker."

Nonetheless, the submissions also exposed that he was taking issue with the manner in which the Tribunal purported to apply the statute to the circumstances.

Case309,applied,Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280,"to this trio is Mr Kronen's conception of what is signified by the words ""to be negotiated"" in s 605(3). What is clear is that the level of permissible compromise and of required mutual agreement that this formula might otherwise suggest when used in other contexts, is radically curtailed in this statutory setting. Whether one can say that the ordinary meaning of ""negotiate"" is what is intended here (albeit what can be negotiated is limited by the Act and its purposes), hence the meaning is a question of fact: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287 (proposition 2); or that its meaning and hence proper construction is contrived by its legislative settings, hence are questions of law: Pozzolanic , 287 (propositions 1 and 4), what is clear is that Mr Kronen misapprehends the latitude the Act gives him. Elblematic of this was his presenting Maxima with negotiation procedures which included referral to an independent panel if any terms could not be agreed. If Mr Kronen is to qualify for a newstart allowance, he was required, in the circumstances, enter into an activity agreement: s 593(1)(e); he was required to undertake one or more activities that the Secretary regarded as suitable for the person: s 606(1); the terms of the agreement were to be approved by the Secretary. In this scheme, the ""right to negotiate"" could be illusory in quite some degree for some purposes and especially when the Secretary (or a delegate) takes decisions or actions in effectuation of the purposes of the Act itself. This is not to say that there was no room for discussion, accommodation and compromise. Rather, it is to recognise that the actual terms of the negotiation itself were something in relation to which the Secretary, acting reasonably and in good faith, could ultimately dictate, approve or disapprove, if there was to be an agreement. The Tribunal clearly understood this was the case: see Reasons [106]-[108]. It committed no error of law in construing and hence giving legal effect to the ""negotiation expectation"" of s 605(3) as it did. Further, the Tribunal satisfied itself on the evidence before it that the requirements Maxima sought to impose were reasonable and that those upon which Mr Kronen insisted were unreasonable in the circumstances. These fact findings were open to it and were unimpeachable in this proceeding."
Case310,considered,Port of Brisbane Corporation v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1232,"There is one case concerning par (ac). It is Port of Brisbane Corporation v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1232. That was an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and was therefore limited to questions of law. The decision appears to have been based upon a finding that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had considered irrelevant material in construing the relevant legislative provisions. In those circumstances, the decision can be of little assistance for present purposes. 35 This case depends upon the meaning of the expression ""in rail transport"". A considerable amount of time was spent in discussing the meaning of the word ""in"", in my opinion, not a particularly fruitful area of debate. To my mind, the more significant aspect is the word ""transport"", with any particular connotations that the word ""rail"" may contribute. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the word ""transport"", used as a noun, to mean: 'transfer or conveyance of property ... the carrying or conveyance of a person or thing from one place to another ... a system or means of transportation or conveyance of people, goods etc ...' 36 The question depends substantially upon whether, in the present context, the word ""transport"" means the carriage or conveyance of persons or things or the system of transportation or conveyance. The Commissioner advanced the former view. Queensland Rail advanced the latter. The Commissioner submitted that the word ""in"" connoted such a close association between the use of the diesel fuel and the rail that it could only be satisfied if the usage occurred on the rail. Thus the movement of persons or goods (including Queensland Rail's own equipment) on rail would be included, but loading or unloading a train with loading equipment, which was not on-rail, would not. Similarly, the use of diesel fuel in rail-mounted track maintenance equipment would be included, but such use in non-rail mounted equipment would not. 37 This approach may give too much significance to the word ""rail"" which is used adjectivally to qualify the word ""transport"". The preposition ""in"" governs the noun ""transport"". In other words the phrase ""in rail transport"" means ""in transport which uses rail"". 38 If Parliament had intended that only use of diesel fuel in activities on-rail was to attract the rebate, it would have been easy to say so. Language analogous to the very specific language used for the purpose of excluding the rebate in the case of vehicles used on public roads and use relating to forestry might have been appropriate. Paragraphs (ad), (b), (c) and (d) are ""place-specific"" and might also have been appropriate models for a requirement that the relevant activity occur ""on-rail""."
Case311,followed,White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298,"Lindgren J has recently collected the cases on the meaning and effect of s 31A and comparable provisions: White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [58] - [59] , where he considered the test to be whether there are ""real"" as opposed to ""fanciful"" or ""merely arguable"" prospects. 10 Lilly's motion gives rise to three issues. The first is the viability of the applicant's claim to relief under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act . The second is whether the applicant has standing to claim relief under the ADJR Act, s 192 of the Patents Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act . The third is whether, assuming it has standing, it should be denied relief because of its delay. In a s 31A context, in each case the question is whether the Court is satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of the applicant succeeding in the relevant claim or issue. 11 The applicant alleges that in applying for an extension of the term of the Patent, Lilly represented to the first respondent (the Commissioner) that the pharmaceutical substance on the ARTG on which it relied was disclosed in claims 1 to 4 and 6 of the Patent. The applicant alleges that these representations were made in trade and commerce and were false."
Case312,followed,Glueck v Stang (2008) 76 IPR 75,"In Glueck v Stang (2008) 76 IPR 75 the applicant alleged that Novopharm, in trade or commerce, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to an application to the Australian Patent Office for the grant of letters patent. At [32] to [33] Lindgren J said: The course of authority outlined above requires me to hold that the alleged representations by Novopharm to the APO ... were not made in trade or commerce. They were not made in the course of a trading or commercial relationship between Novopharm on the one hand, and ... the APO ... on the other hand. Novopharm had no trading or commercial dealings with the APO .... Nor were they made in the course of the negotiation of contracts .... The alleged representations were made to a government instrumentality pursuant to legislation for the purpose of obtaining an exclusive right or bundle of rights made available by that legislation. No doubt the alleged representations were made by Novopharm in trade or commerce in a broad non-s 52 sense. However, in Concrete Constructions the High Court ... rejected the view that the expression 'in trade or commerce' in s 52 referred to the 'immense field of activities' in which corporations may engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, carrying on some overall trading or commercial business .... 14 The applicant sought to distinguish the present case from Glueck on the ground that the facts of the two cases were different. That is true, but the proposition derived by Lindgren J from the authorities referred to is applicable here. Essentially that is because of the passage in Concrete Constructions at 604, upon which Glueck was based, in which it was said: What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it ... has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character. It is that relationship that is absent here. I am not persuaded that Glueck is plainly wrong, and accordingly I should follow it."

Case316,applied,Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 246 ; (2005) 68 IPR 105,"In Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 246 ; (2005) 68 IPR 105 at [19] the Full Court referred to the observations of McLelland J in a trade mark context in Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193 ( Ritz ), and said: [Adapting] that language to the design context, the expression would embrace any person having a real interest in having the entry expunged and thus would include any person who would be or in respect of whom there is a reasonable possibility of his or her being 'appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense' by the entry not being expunged. 27 I return to the Assa Abloy test recorded at [18]. Adapted to the present case, the question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the applicant would be disadvantaged in the sense that it would be prevented from exploiting the invention in any of the respects falling within the definition of ""exploit"" in the Patents Act . That includes a number of things preparatory to placing a product in the marketplace. Matters falling within the concept of ""launching"" a product include importing, keeping for the purpose of offering for sale, and using. In my view the fair reading of par 49 of Mr Gray's affidavit is that propounded by the applicant. Nor do I think the use of the word ""marketing"" in par 26 of that affidavit bears the emphasis Lilly places on it. All Mr Gray is saying is that in order successfully to sell a product, that is to say make money out of it, PBS listing is essential. As appears from [19] and [21], the applicant has pleaded only that it has not yet obtained TGA approval, believes it will obtain it in late 2008 or early 2009, and will not import and sell the product until it receives TGA registration. It does not plead PBS listing as a precondition. The Assa Abloy test speaks of the existence of a reasonable possibility of disadvantage. For the purposes of a s 31A application, I am not satisfied that that possibility does not exist. I am not persuaded that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the ADJR, s 192 and s 39A parts of the proceeding by reason of a lack of standing. 28 Section 11(1)(c) of the ADJR Act provides that an application for an order of review in relation to a written decision ""that was furnished to the applicant"" must be lodged within the prescribed period or within such further time as the court allows. Under sub-s (3) the prescribed period is the period commencing on the day on which the decision is made and ending on the 28 th day after the decision is ""furnished to the applicant"". Subsection (4) provides that where no period is prescribed, the court may refuse to entertain an application if of the opinion that the application was not made within a reasonable time after the decision was made. In forming an opinion for the purposes of subs (4), the court is to have regard to the time at which the applicant became aware of the making of the decision: subs (5)(a)."

In this case the applicant discovered the existence of the decision through its own resources. I agree with Pincus J in Australian Foreman Stevedores Association v Crone (1988) 20 FCR 377 that the expression ""furnished to the applicant"" contemplates delivery specifically to the applicant by the decision-maker. Accordingly the matter is to be approached under subss (4) and (5). 30 It is common ground that the alleged delay in relation to the s 192 and s 39B parts of the case are to be dealt with on the same basis as the ADJR aspect, so that relief may be refused if application was not made within a reasonable time. 31 A chronology of the relevant events will assist in understanding the parties' contentions on delay. 14 January 2000 Extension of term granted 12 March 2002 Applicant incorporated May 2003 Applicant signed agreement with EBEWE Pharma Late May 2005, 2006- 2007 Dr Schnait of EBEWE Pharma tells Mr Gray that while Lilly had an Austrian patent for the product he could find no equivalent patent in Australia 2 August 2007 Applicant becomes aware of Australian patent and extension of term 12 October 2007 Applicant obtains patent file from IP Australia 26 October 2007 Applicant's TGA application 5 December 2007 Applicant writes to Lilly contending that extension of term was wrong and seeking confirmation of this 18 December 2007 Lilly sends letter of demand as to infringement 20 December 2007 Applicant seeks without prejudice meeting with Lilly to discuss commercial resolution 11 January to 27 February 2008 Communications about without prejudice meeting 28 February 2008 Without prejudice meeting 6 March 2008 Negotiations break down; Lilly sends second letter of demand 18 March 2008 Applicant informed of Austrian injunction 19 March 2008 Applicant seeks review of extension"
Case319,applied,Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 194,"The principles which ordinarily govern the exercise of the Court's discretion to award costs pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) where an applicant no longer wishes to proceed were identified in Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201. Those principles, so far as presently relevant, may be summarised as follows. First, the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceeding by making a costs order. Secondly, although the Court will not ordinarily seek to determine the likely outcome of a hypothetical trial, it may be more ready to do so where the issues are simple and issues of credit do not arise. Thirdly, it will ordinarily be appropriate for the Court to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties in instituting and defending the proceedings and it may be appropriate for the Court to consider whether unreasonable conduct of the respondent precipitated the commencement of the proceeding."
Case320,cited,Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 264,"The Bankruptcy Act recognises that the Court may extend the time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice where proceedings to set aside the judgment in respect of which the notice was issued have been instituted by the debtor (s 41(6A)(a)). The power to extend time for compliance is in aid of the power to set aside the notice itself should the judgment ultimately be set aside ( Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 264 at 268). The judgment upon which the bankruptcy notice was founded has now been set aside. I conclude that Mr George Elias acted reasonably in instituting this proceeding. 15 The trustee was entitled to serve the bankruptcy notice as no stay of execution of the District Court judgment had been sought (s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act ). I am not satisfied that he acted unreasonably in doing so. However, he must be assumed to have understood that, if the judgment were set aside on appeal, the judgment debt on which the bankruptcy notice was founded would no longer exist and the notice would be liable to be set aside. 16 The judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the judgment of the District Court was unanimous. One member of the Court of Appeal was implicitly critical of the conduct of the trustee in opposing a stay of proceedings in the District Court to allow the s 139ZQ notice to be challenged in the Federal Magistrates Court (Giles JA at [51]). Another member of the Court of Appeal considered that there was 'some plausibility' in the contention that the District Court proceeding should have been stayed but found it unnecessary to consider the issue (Santow JA at [111]). The third member (Bryson JA) of the Court of Appeal also found it unnecessary to consider the issue. However, all members of the Court of Appeal concluded that the District Court erred in entering summary judgment against Mr George Elias. I infer that the District Court adopted this course at the invitation of the trustee. I incline to the view that, in this sense, unreasonable conduct of the trustee precipitated the events that led to the institution of this proceeding."
Case321,referred to,Elias v Pascoe [2006] NSWCA 110,"On 9 May 2006 the New South Wales Court of Appeal granted Mr George Elias leave to appeal against the judgment of the District Court, allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment ( Elias v Pascoe [2006] NSWCA 110)."
Case322,cited,Principal Strategic Options Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 664,"In my view, the above principles also ordinarily guide the exercise of the Court's discretion in comparable circumstances to award costs pursuant to s 32 of the Bankruptcy Act . As I observed in Principal Strategic Options Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 664 at [17] - [18] , s 32 gives the Court a very wide discretion with respect to orders for costs, albeit that the discretion must be exercised judicially. 11 Mr George Elias submitted that the trustee should pay his costs of this proceeding because the trustee had acted precipitously in serving the bankruptcy notice. He argued that, once the holding summons for leave to appeal had been filed, it was inherently risky to serve the bankruptcy notice; the risk having eventuated, the trustee should pay the costs reasonably incurred by him with respect to the bankruptcy notice. 12 The trustee submitted that as no stay of the judgment of the District Court had been obtained, or indeed sought, he had acted reasonably and properly in serving the bankruptcy notice and in respect of the conduct of this proceeding."
Case323,discussed,Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564,"any event, it is clear enough that there is no matter if there is no real controversy between parties. Various words have been used to describe what will not qualify as a matter on this ground: abstract question, theoretical question or hypothetical question. In Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 , Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ referred to the discretionary power to grant a declaration as being confined by considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power. Their Honours said (at 581-582): ""It is now accepted that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief. It is a discretionary power which '[i]t is neither possible nor desirable to fetter ... by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise.' However, it is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power. Hence, declaratory relief must be directed to the determination of legal controversies and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions. The person seeking relief must have 'a real interest' and relief will not be granted if the question 'is purely hypothetical', if relief is 'claimed in relation to circumstances that [have] not occurred and might never happen' or if 'the Court's declaration will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties'.""

Case326,cited,Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones (UK) Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 365,"order sought by the second respondent (set out at [6] above) is sought under O 9 r 7(1)(a). In Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones (UK) Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 365 ("" Cell Tech Communications ""), Lindgren J made a number of observations about the scope of O 9 r 7(1). His Honour said that the rule was to be distinguished from an application for summary dismissal (O 20 r 2) and an application for the striking out of pleading (O 11 r 16). To these I would add an application for summary judgment (Federal Court Act s 31A) and an order for dismissal which may follow the determination of a separate question under O 29 r 2. Lindgren J also made the point (at 370) that, although the other procedures he identified were to be distinguished from O 9 r 7, that was not to say that ""considerations relevant to such applications may not be relevant to an application under one or other of the paragraphs of O 9, r 7(1)"". The authorities establish that O 9 r 7(1) is not confined to cases where there has been service outside the jurisdiction. While O 9 r 7(1)(b), (c) and (d) refer to service of an originating process, (a) does not, and under that subparagraph an originating process may be set aside where the Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim made in it, or where the originating process constitutes an abuse of process: F Sharkey &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Fisher [1980] FCA 146 ; (1980) 50 FLR 130 ; 33 ALR 173 ; Cell Tech Communications (at 370). The second respondent's first ground (see [7] above) raises an issue of jurisdiction and, if made good, engages the power to set aside the originating process. By contrast, the second ground does not raise an issue of jurisdiction, and, even if made good, does not engage the power to set aside the originating process. I have not been able to find any direct authority addressing the submission by the second respondent that an originating process served within the jurisdiction may nevertheless be set aside because the applicant has no prima facie case on the merits. There is authority that it is not appropriate to exercise the power in O 9 r 7 on the ground that a party's pleadings are defective: Cell Tech Communications at 371 per Lindgren J. I do not think the power in O 9 r 7 extends to cases where the originating process has been served within the jurisdiction and a respondent claims that the applicant has no prima facie case on the merits. The rules, and now s 31A of the Federal Court Act, provide adequate procedures for a party who claims that the case against him or her has no substance. The second respondent's submission that I can order that the application be set aside under O 9 r 7 because the applicant does not have a prima facie case on the merits must be rejected. I would not permit the second respondent to call in aid s 31A of the Federal Court Act in circumstances where it was not referred to in the application or supporting affidavit and was only mentioned briefly in submissions. Jurisdiction In her application, the applicant relies on s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act and s 21 of the Federal Court Act. The important provision is s 39B(1A)(c) because s 21 gives this Court power to grant declarations only in those matters in which the Court has original jurisdiction."

Case328,discussed,Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421,"have been considerable developments in the law relating to declarations since the decision in In re Judiciary and Navigation Acts . One of the leading High Court decisions in the area of declarations is Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421. That case dealt with the statutory power of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in s 10 of the Equity Act 1901 (NSW) to make a declaration. Gibbs J said (at 437) that it was neither possible nor desirable to fetter the broad discretion in s 10 by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise. His Honour said that, in general, the requirements identified by Lord Dunedin in Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd [1921] 2 AC 438 should be satisfied before the discretion to make a declaration is exercised. In the latter case, Lord Dunedin said (at 448): ""The question must be a real and not a theoretical question; the person raising it must have a real interest to raise it; he must be able to secure a proper contradictor, that is to say, some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought."""

He submits that the question raised, and the relief sought, is abstract or hypothetical.

It is not said, for example, that the Court would never make the declaration sought because it is claimed in relation to circumstances that have not occurred and might never happen in the sense explained by Gibbs J in The University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1 at 9-11, or because it will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties in the sense explained by Mason J in Gardner v The Dairy Industry Authority of New South Wales (1978) 52 ALJR 180 ; 18 ALR 55 at 188; 69."

Beyond that there is no legal restriction on the award of a declaration."""
Case331,discussed,IMF (Australia) Ltd v Sons of Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) (2004) 211 ALR 231,"has been a good deal of debate in the authorities as to whether, in the case of a general statutory power to make declarations, and leaving aside a statutory intention to exclude the remedy of declaration, there are any jurisdictional limits on the power of the Court to make a declaration, or whether all the matters which from time to time have been identified in the authorities as relevant are no more than discretionary considerations (see, for example, the discussion of this issue by King CJ in J N Taylor Holdings Ltd (in liq) v Bond (1993) 59 SASR 432 at 436-437). There is also a question of whether jurisdiction and discretion are ""congruent"" in relation to declaratory relief. That was said by French J in IMF (Australia) Ltd v Sons of Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) (2004) 211 ALR 231 ("" Sons of Gwalia "") at 243 [45] to be debatable. In Sons of Gwalia , French J considered a case involving a declaration as to the lawfulness of future conduct. His Honour said (at 243 [44]): ""In my opinion, the issue in the present application is neither hypothetical nor contingent. It involves a real question, namely whether IMF can lawfully proceed to do what it intends to do in using information on the Sons of Gwalia register to approach members and former members of the company with a view to joining them in possible recovery action against the company. The capacity of courts to declare that conduct, which has not yet taken place, will or will not be in breach of the law 'contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction': Commonwealth of Australia v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 19 ; (1972) 126 CLR 297 at 305; [1972-3] ALR 23."" In my opinion, there is a matter in this case and it arises under a law of the Parliament, namely, the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). There is a real controversy and the question raised is not an abstract or hypothetical question. It seems to me important not to confuse considerations relating to the desirability of the Tribunal ruling on the issue and then the matter proceeding by way of judicial review through the seeking of constitutional writs. Those considerations are relevant, perhaps highly relevant, to whether this Court should, as a matter of discretion, entertain the application for declaratory relief. They do not go to the question of whether there is a matter ."
Case332,discussed,In re the Judiciary Act 1903-1920 and In re the Navigation Act 1912-1920 [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257,"starting point in determining whether there is a matter within s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act is the early decision of the High Court in In re the Judiciary Act 1903-1920 and In re the Navigation Act 1912-1920 [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257 ("" In re Judiciary and Navigation Acts "").

The Court said (at 267) that the power to confer jurisdiction under Ch III of the Constitution did not include a jurisdiction to ""determine abstract questions of law without the right or duty of any body or person being involved""."

His Honour was dealing with a case involving a declaration as to the lawfulness of future conduct. He said that the difference between a hypothetical and a non-hypothetical question was one of degree and he referred to the following passage from the United States case of Maryland Casualty Co v Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co [1941] USSC 28 ; 312 US 270 (1941) at 273: ""The difference between an abstract question and a 'controversy' contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree, and it would be difficult, if it would be possible, to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy. Basically, the question in every case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment."" Brennan J said (at 333-334; 209): ""A controversy as to the lawfulness of future conduct cannot be said to be immediate and real if it is unlikely that the applicant will engage in the conduct ( Golden, Acting District Attorney of Kings County v. Zwickler [1969] USSC 46 ; (1969) 394 U.S. 103 , at p. 109). If the prospects of the applicant engaging in the conduct are uncertain, the uncertainty may deprive the controversy of a sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the making of a declaration ( Steffel v. Thompson [1974] USSC 53 ; (1973) 415 U.S. 452 , at p. 460). The degree of uncertainty as to whether the applicant will engage in the conduct proposed will usually determine whether the circumstances call for the making of a declaration.""

The relief sought should be refused in any event because an adequate alternative remedy is available, being a review by the first respondent, the Migration Review Tribunal, and, if appropriate, an application for constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal. In this case, the facts necessary for determining whether a declaration should be made have occurred and are not in dispute. The second respondent claims that the applicant was given notice of the delegate's decision and the reasons therefor on 22 September 2008, and that by reason of s 494C of the Act (and the construction placed on that section in Xie ) the applicant's application for review by the Tribunal is not competent. The applicant wishes to pursue an application for review by the Tribunal with a view to having the decision of the delegate reversed. Those circumstances are sufficient to give rise to a matter . One submission made by the second respondent should be addressed before leaving this topic. It was suggested that this case was similar to Re McBain; Ex parte Australian Catholic Bishops Conference [2002] HCA 16 ; (2002) 209 CLR 372 in that the thrust of the application was an attack on the reasoning in Xie and that did not give rise to a justiciable issue (cf at 394-396 [22] and [26] per Gleeson CJ). That argument must be rejected because, in this case, the proper interpretation of s 494C of the Act has a direct effect on the competency of the applicant's application for review. Discretion"

The applicant complained that the SCT should not have taken into account the video surveillance evidence because it was in digital format. He said that the video might have been altered, cropped, edited or corrupted in its conversion to the digital format. He also complained that the SCT failed to take into consideration that the medical report from Dr BC was based on a short term medical treatment. It failed to take into account that Dr BC was a general practitioner, not a specialist. It failed to take into account any and all pain levels experienced in the activities seen on the video footage. He said that the SCT could not know what medication he had taken on that day or prior to being able to drive his vehicle. The SCT failed to take into account the disadvantage that he had been placed in by receiving his disability support pension. He said also that the SCT should not have taken into account the report of the private investigators. They were not signed and therefore they were inadmissible. 56 The Tribunal's powers, for complaints under s 14, are identified in s 37.

Case359,applied,Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp (1996) 67 FCR 65,"The Court has the power to grant a stay in its discretion pursuant to O 52 r 17 of the Federal Courts Rules.

It is sufficient for the respondent to demonstrate that there is a reason or it is an appropriate case to warrant the exercise of the discretion: see Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp (1996) 67 FCR 65 at 66. 6 The prima facie assumption is that the judgment appealed from is correct and the Court should not deprive a litigant of the benefit of a judgment in its favour. Counsel for the Union relied on this and opposed the grant of a stay upon the basis, first, that the appeal disclosed no arguable ground of appeal, alternatively, the prospects of success were weak; secondly, Ms Chester said all but three of the employees had indicated that they would repay the money if called upon to do so pursuant to a judgment of the Court on appeal; and, thirdly, the evidence for Prestige did not rise above speculation as to the difficulty of recovery. 7 According to counsel for Prestige, it proposed to challenge the judgment under appeal on two bases, first, that as a matter of construction the Victorian Arts Centre is not a premise of a state government instrumentality for the purposes of the relevant industrial awards in the ordinary sense of those words; and, secondly, as understood in context, having regard to relevant history, it was not such an instrumentality."

Case364,affirmed,SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 163,"This is set out conveniently in [3] to [17] of the decision of the Federal Magistrate whose orders are the subject of the present appeal: SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 163. The following is an adaptation of those paragraphs. I should indicate at the outset that the Tribunal has made three decisions in relation to review applications of the appellant. Though it is technically inaccurate, I will for ease in exposition differentiate between what I will call the ""first Tribunal"", ""the second Tribunal"" and the ""third Tribunal"". 4 The Tribunal decision, the subject of the present judicial review proceedings, is in fact the third decision of the Tribunal in relation to the appellant. The first review was conducted in 2000. The appellant was unsuccessful, both before the delegate of the Minister and before the Tribunal at that time and for reasons of lack of credibility in each instance. In the claim advanced by the appellant in 2000 he and his wife used false identities. His claimed entitlement to a protection visa and to refugee status under the Refugee Convention arose from a fear of his being persecuted by Serbs, arising out of what he said was his forced conscription into the Kosovo Liberation Army. 5 Notwithstanding the lack of success of their application, in 2001 the Minister exercised his discretion under s 417(1) of the Act and provided the appellant and his wife with three year protection visas on humanitarian grounds."
Case365,cited,STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556,"The Tribunal noted that the appellant's brother had succeeded on a similar claim. The appellant's brother's claim had been made prior to the amendment of s 91S of the Act that was effected by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 6) 2001 (Cth) . The effect of these amendments is described in the decision of the High Court in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556. 14 The Tribunal went on to say: Even if I were satisfied which I am not that the applicant's family were involved in such a feud, the applicant's claims amount to a claim to fear persecution for reason of membership of a particular social group, namely his family. In considering such a claim, s 91S of the Migration Act would be relevant and, in interpreting that provision, I would be bound by the terms and reasons of the High Court's decision in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ... Following that decision and applying s 91S(a) , it is clear that the applicant's cousin, Martin's fear of persecution would be for a reason other than those mentioned in Art 1A(2) of the Convention namely revenge for murder. Section 91S(a) would then require that fear of persecution to be disregarded. Section 91S(b)(i) would then require the applicant's fear of persecution to be disregarded, since it would be reasonable to conclude that that fear would not exist if his cousin's fear had never existed. And s 91S(b)(ii) would require that his father's and brother's fear of persecution be disregarded, since it would be reasonable to conclude that neither of those fears would exist either if the cousin's fear had never existed. The result of disregarding the fears of persecution of the cousin, the applicant, the father and the brother would then be that the applicant would be treated as not having a well-founded fear of persecution for the reason of membership of a particular social group that consists of the (sic) his family. 15 It is necessary to refer only to two provisions of the Act, s 91S and s 425. Section 91S provides: For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person (the first person), in determining whether the first person has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for the reason of membership of a particular social group that consists of the first person's family: (a) disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that any other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of the family has ever experienced, where the reason for the fear or persecution is not a reason mentioned in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; and (b) disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that: (i) the first person has ever experienced; or (ii) any other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of the family has ever experienced; where it is reasonable to conclude that the fear or persecution would not exist if it were assumed that the fear or persecution mentioned in paragraph (a) had never existed. 16 As the decision of the High Court in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs illustrates, this provision has an inexorable operation to fears of persecution based on family membership in the usual blood feud case. 17 Section 425(1) provides: The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review."
Case366,cited,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152,"As the High Court indicated in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [33] to [35]: [33] The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited ""to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review "". The reference to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"" is important. [34] Those issues will not be sufficiently identified in every case by describing them simply as whether the applicant is entitled to a protection visa. The statutory language ""arising in relation to the decision under review"" is more particular. The issues arising in relation to a decision under review are to be identified having regard not only to the fact that the Tribunal may exercise ... all the powers and discretions conferred by the Act on the original decision-maker (here, the minister's delegate), but also to the fact that the Tribunal is to review that particular decision, for which the decision-maker will have given reasons. [35] The Tribunal is not confined to whatever may have been the issues that the delegate considered. The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal. But ... unless some other additional issues are identified by the Tribunal (as they may be), it would ordinarily follow that, on review by the Tribunal, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant. (Emphasis in original.) 19 As I have already noted, the particular decision that was under review by the third Tribunal was the decision of the second delegate who said that he found the appellant was not credible in those claims originally advanced under his false identity and that he made no claims in relation to fear of persecution in Albania under his actual name. To reiterate the Albanian blood feud claims were only raised for the first time before the second Tribunal whose decision was quashed by Brown FM. 20 There has been recent discussion and some level of disagreement between judges of this Court on the operation of s 425(1) where a Tribunal decision is quashed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal (whether or not constituted by the same member) for determination. For present purposes I would merely note the following."
Case367,cited,SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291,"(i) Until the Tribunal makes a valid decision on the review that has been initiated by a valid application under s 414, it has a duty to perform that particular review: SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291 at [39]. 23 (iii) When a decision on a particular review is set aside, it is a decision of the Tribunal, not of the person constituting it, that is set aside: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at [31] . Correspondingly, a redetermination of the particular review is a redetermination by the Tribunal, not by the particular member who happens to constitute the Tribunal for the purpose: SZEPZ at [38]. 24 (iv) As was said by the Full Court in SZEPZ at [39]: An invalid decision by the Tribunal is no decision at all but it does not follow that all steps and procedures taken in arriving at that invalid decision are themselves invalid. The Tribunal still has before it the materials that were obtained when the decision that had been set aside was made. To the extent that Cowdroy J is properly to be taken as suggesting to the contrary in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 ; (2007) 98 ALD 567 at [34] , his Honour's view ought not be followed in my view. 25 (v) As it is the Tribunal which continues to conduct the particular review consequent upon a remitter, the steps taken by the Tribunal to discharge its statutory obligations under s 424A and s 425 in the conduct of that review prior to the making of an invalid decision may, but need not necessarily, be a sufficient discharge of those statutory obligations for the purpose of making a subsequent and valid decision on the review: SZEPZ (on s 424A); SZILQ (on s 425); and also NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413. Thus, a s 424A notice or a s 425 invitation given prior to the Tribunal's invalid decision may, or may not, suffice without a further notice or invitation depending upon whether on the remitter the circumstances then are such that s 424A or s 425 does or does not require, according to their respective terms, a fresh notice or invitation."
Case368,cited,SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 163 FCR 304,"(ii) An invalid Tribunal decision in purported performance of a particular review is to be treated for all purposes as having no operative effect and it does not represent a performance by the Tribunal of its duty in connection with that review: SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 163 FCR 304 at [10]. 25 (v) As it is the Tribunal which continues to conduct the particular review consequent upon a remitter, the steps taken by the Tribunal to discharge its statutory obligations under s 424A and s 425 in the conduct of that review prior to the making of an invalid decision may, but need not necessarily, be a sufficient discharge of those statutory obligations for the purpose of making a subsequent and valid decision on the review: SZEPZ (on s 424A); SZILQ (on s 425); and also NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413.

Case376,discussed,Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1965] HCA 58 ; (1965) 114 CLR 314,"Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1965] HCA 58 ; (1965) 114 CLR 314 ( Arthur Murray ) was, in a sense, the converse of Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108. The taxpayer company received fees for dancing lessons yet to be given. It placed the fees in a suspense account until the lessons were given, when it transferred them to its revenue account. The High Court held that the fees were not assessable income at the time of receipt. 146 In Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 434, Hill J, with whom Jenkinson and Einfeld JJ agreed, cautioned against a too ready reliance on business and accounting practice relating to preparation of the company's profit and loss account required in accordance with s 269(1) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code (at 443 446). His Honour stated (at 445 446): With respect to his Honour, who presumably must be taken as having decided otherwise, I do not think that the accounting evidence in the present case establishes that the amount derived each year by applying the financial or actuarial method represents income in ordinary concepts. What that evidence establishes is that the outcome of the finance or actuarial method is an appropriate figure to be used in the preparation of the profit and loss account of the respondent for the year in accordance with the Companies (New South Wales) Code : s 269(1). If the relevant issue were the determination of the profit of the respondents, or whether that profit was to be seen as on revenue account, the evidence would clearly be most cogent. But it must be remembered that the role of the accounting standards is in the determination of profit so as to ensure that financial statements, required to be prepared by statute, give a true and fair view and not the determination of ""income"", notwithstanding that those two concepts may, as will be seen, sometimes overlap. Thus Professor Walker [an expert witness] states that he has been asked to advise as to the correct method of accounting in relation to the leases in question. But his affidavit and subsequent explanation makes it clear that he has answered that question by reference to the companies law for the purposes of which the relevant standards have been prepared and with which of course each of the respondents was obliged to comply. Mr Westworth's affidavit [regarding accounting practices] makes clear that he too has addressed himself to that issue, not relevant in the present proceedings. All that may be said is that if there be no impediment in the Act to bringing into account, in a case such as the present, a net profit figure as gross income, then that profit figure will need to be calculated in accordance with the accounting standards. The real issue for decision is rather a question of construction of the Act, namely, whether in a case such as the present, the scheme of the Act precludes treating as gross income the net profit calculated in accordance with the financial or actuarial method. Hill J noted earlier, however, that accounting evidence was often relevant and often highly significant in resolving issues under the Act. He gave as an example the issue whether a cash receipts or accruals basis of accounting will give ""a true reflex of the income derived by a taxpayer"" (at 443, citing Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 his Honour also cited Arthur Murray [1965] HCA 58 ; 114 CLR 314). 149 In Commissioner of Taxation (Commonwealth) v Sun Alliance Investments Pty Limited (in liq) [2005] HCA 70 ; (2005) 225 CLR 488, the High Court in a joint judgment, drew attention to the fact that the meaning of the word ""derived"" in a particular provision could not be ascertained without at least some reference to the thing said to be derived (in that case, the profits of the company) (at [42]). In particular their Honours cautioned against conflating the concept of derivation of income with derivation of profits. Their Honours referred to the fact that for the most part the notion of ""income"" directs attention to ""receipts"" by a taxpayer. Their Honours further referred to the late Professor RW Parsons's work, Income Taxation in Australia (The Law Book Company, 1985) in which the learned author stated (at [2.10]): ""For the most part, the law expresses an ordinary usage notion of derivation of a receipt"". I do not think that their Honours or the late learned author were intending to exclude the possibility that business and accounting practice might demonstrate, in the case of the particular category of income, that it is derived at a time other than upon receipt. Arthur Murray [1965] HCA 58 ; 114 CLR 314 stands against the existence of any such universal rule."

Case378,distinguished,Bowaters Sales Co Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1958) 38 TC 593,"The authorities cited by the applicants are St Lucia Usines and Estates Company Limited v Colonial Treasurer of St Lucia [1924] AC 508 ( St Lucia ) at 512; Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited [1938] HCA 69 ; (1938) 63 CLR 108 ( Carden's Case ) at 155; Permanent Trustee Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1940) 6 ATD 5 ( Prior's Case ) at 13; South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235 at 253; and Bowaters Sales Co Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1958) 38 TC 593 ( Bowaters ) at 597 599. As well, the applicants refer to the Commissioner's Public Ruling TR 98/1 at [19], in which the Commissioner has said that as a general rule, the receipts method is appropriate to determine income derived from investments, although there are exceptions, such as in the case of interest from a business of money lending carried on by the taxpayer. 69 The Commissioner distinguishes Bowaters 38 TC 593 on the basis that Harman J noted (at 597) that ""[t]here is no evidence here that the function of this Company was mainly the holding of investments"". The Commissioner suggests that his Lordship was intending to distinguish holding companies from purely passive investment companies. The evidence 70 The Commissioner relies on two forms of evidence as being relevant to the question whether ABB Zurich derived income consisting of the dividend when the dividend was declared. The first is evidence relating to the international group of companies known as the ABB Group and its accounting practices. This evidence is found in an affidavit of Alfred Storck of the ABB Group and documentary exhibits. The second class of evidence is expert evidence of an accountant, Brigid Therese Curran, adduced by the Commissioner. The Commissioner read Ms Curran's affidavit subject to objection by the applicants on the ground of relevance. 71 Mr Storck is the Deputy Chief Financial Officer and the person responsible for Corporate Finance and Taxes for the ABB Group. In 1996, he was employed by ABB Zurich as head of its Taxation Division. Mr Storck states that ABB Group ""specialises in the engineering of power and automation technologies"" and ""supplies products and services to utility and industrial customers around the world"". 119 The last of the cases principally relied on by the applicants, Bowaters 38 TC 593, concerned a dividend declared by an Australian subsidiary of a United Kingdom parent. The case concerned provisions of the Finance Act 1937 (UK) and the Finance Act 1952 (UK). The dividend in question was declared on 16 December 1953 but not paid until 28 January 1954. The relevant accounting period commenced on 1 October 1953 and ended on 31 December 1953. Accordingly, the dividend was declared during that chargeable accounting period, but paid after it. 120 The taxpayer company was the main selling company of the Bowaters organisation and was the principal member of a group of companies. It had two subsidiaries that were ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom and a number of non-resident subsidiaries, including the Australian company that declared the dividend. At the annual general meeting of the Australian company held on 16 December 1953, the dividend was declared, in respect of its accounting year ended 30 September 1953, payable forthwith. Bowaters' accounts for the year ended 30 September 1953 anticipated the dividend to be declared by the Australian company. 121 The particular dividend was not included in Bowaters' computation of its profits for the purposes of Excess Profits Levy for the period of three months to 31 December 1953, on the ground that it was received after 31 December 1953. However, the Crown included it in the assessment of profits to Excess Profits Levy for that three month period on the ground that the income arose during that period. It was against that assessment that Bowaters appealed. The Crown affirmed the assessment. As required by Bowaters, a case was stated for the opinion of the High Court. 124 Harman J noted that there was no evidence that the functions of Bowaters was mainly the holding of investments. Rather its business was mainly that of trading in paper, although it also had a number of wholly owned subsidiaries from which it might draw dividends. Accordingly, s 19(4) had no application. 125 His Lordship considered that various English authorities to which he referred established that ""excepting the case of receipts from trade or receipts analogous to trading receipts, the [fundamental conception of Income Tax legislation] is ... receipt and not receivability"" (at 599). His Lordship rejected the Crown's submission that the dividends were as much a part of Bowaters' trade as were the profits of its trading activities. 126 It followed that the expression ""income arising"" in the context before his Lordship (a dividend declared and paid by an Australian subsidiary to its United Kingdom parent) and in every context except that of trade debts, meant income received. The company's appeal was allowed. 127 Harman J expressed the opinion (at 599) that the method by which Bowaters kept its accounts had no relevance for tax purposes. 128 Bowaters 38 TC 593 is said to be against the Commissioner's contention in the present case. I note that I do not see any relevant distinction between the concepts ""arising"" in ss 19 and 20(1) of the Finance Act 1937 (UK) and ""derived"" in the Australian s 128B(1): see Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; 23 CLR 119 at 133 noted at [106] above. 129 Unlike Bowaters, ABB Zurich would apparently have qualified for the purposes of s 19(4) of the Finance Act 1937 (UK) as a company whose functions consisted wholly or mainly in the ""holding of investments"". Indeed, the only business of ABB Zurich was that of managing the affairs of its some 1,000 subsidiaries. It appears, although not clearly so, that the reason why Harman J did not accept a submission by the Crown that the receipt of dividends was as much a part of Bowaters' trade as was the profit from its trading activity, was that s 19(4) did not apply (at 599). In other words, if s 19(4) had applied, as it apparently would have done to the circumstances of ABB Zurich, his Lordship would have treated a dividend from its subsidiary in the same way as he would have done a trading receipt. It seems that his Lordship would have treated the dividend as derived when the debt for it arose, that is to say, when the subsidiary declared the dividend (at 598). 130 Before returning to consider the evidence, in particular that of Ms Curran, I will refer to the authorities called in aid of the Commissioner."
Case379,discussed,Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 99 ATC 5193,"The Commissioner submits that for the purposes of identifying the appropriate basis of accounting, the authorities show or suggest that a holding company is classified as a trading company. He cites Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1966) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ) at 663 664; Esquire Nominees Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 32 ; (1973) 129 CLR 177 ( Esquire Nominees ) at 212 per Barwick CJ, 221 per Menzies J; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 ( Brookton ) at 469 per Aickin J; and Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 99 ATC 5193 ( BHP v FCT ) at [48] per Kenny J."
Case380,discussed,Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441,"Prior to the introduction of those provisions, there was a well established distinction between final and interim dividends. A declaration of a final dividend by the shareholders gave rise to an immediate debt owed by the company to the shareholders, whereas a resolution by the directors to pay an interim dividend did not do so: Potel v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] 2 All ER 504 at 511 512; Industrial Equity Limited v Blackburn [1977] HCA 59 ; (1977) 137 CLR 567 at 572; Marra Developments Ltd v BW Rofe Pty Ltd [1977] 2 NSWLR 616 at 625; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 at 455. Thus, a declaration of a final dividend could not be revoked and the company's indebtedness to its shareholders eliminated, if profits ceased to be available to fund the dividend between the time of the declaration and the time fixed for payment. A decision of the directors to pay an interim dividend, on the other hand, could always be revoked down to the time fixed for payment. 66 The Commissioner submits that for the purposes of identifying the appropriate basis of accounting, the authorities show or suggest that a holding company is classified as a trading company. He cites Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1966) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ) at 663 664; Esquire Nominees Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 32 ; (1973) 129 CLR 177 ( Esquire Nominees ) at 212 per Barwick CJ, 221 per Menzies J; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 ( Brookton ) at 469 per Aickin J; and Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 99 ATC 5193 ( BHP v FCT ) at [48] per Kenny J. 139 The Commissioner also refers to a passage in the judgment of Aickin J in Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441. His Honour stated (at 469) that in the case of a company that had no activity other than the receipt of dividends from shares that it had purchased, it would ordinarily be regarded as carrying on a business, even if it did not actively manage its portfolio of investments, whereas an individual in the same circumstances would not necessarily be regarded as carrying on such a business. Aickin J cited Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 at 212 per Barwick CJ and 221 per Menzies J. Again, the statement is relevant only to the question whether ABB Zurich carried on a business. I accept that it did. 140 Finally, the Commissioner relies on BHP v FCT 99 ATC 5193, in which Kenny J said (at [48]) that the taxpayer company carried on businesses which included holding shares in, and managing, its subsidiaries. Her Honour stated, citing Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 and Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441, that the holding of shares in subsidiaries can of itself constitute the carrying of a business for the purposes of s 51(1) of the Act. 167 Cases on the statutory definition of ""paid"" similarly suggest that the word ""paid"", even standing alone, refers to the making over of a benefit that is accepted in discharge of the dividend debt. Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441 concerned s 44(1)(a) of the Act (set out at [6] above). It will be recalled that s 44(1) referred to dividends paid to a shareholder. Mason J said (at 456) that the purpose of the extended definition of ""paid"" in s 6 is to guard against the possibility, perhaps remote , that the word ""paid"" might be so narrowly construed that dividends credited or distributed to shareholders in circumstances where they can no longer be revoked or rescinded by the company would not constitute assessable income in the hands of shareholders. (Emphasis added.) Once declared, the present dividend could not be revoked. I do not construe the word ""paid"" in art 82(1) of ABB Australia's articles of association (see [51] above) or understand the general law notion of payment so narrowly that the effectuation of the dividend declared in favour of ABB Zurich by payment could take no form other than the transfer of money to it."
Case381,distinguished,Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1966) 115 CLR 653,"The Commissioner submits that for the purposes of identifying the appropriate basis of accounting, the authorities show or suggest that a holding company is classified as a trading company. He cites Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1966) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ) at 663 664; Esquire Nominees Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 32 ; (1973) 129 CLR 177 ( Esquire Nominees ) at 212 per Barwick CJ, 221 per Menzies J; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 ( Brookton ) at 469 per Aickin J; and Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 99 ATC 5193 ( BHP v FCT ) at [48] per Kenny J. 131 In Carapark [1967] HCA 5 ; 115 CLR 653, the taxpayer was a holding company which had a contract of insurance providing for payment to it of a lump sum in the event of death by air accident of its employee or the employee of an associated or subsidiary company. An employee of a subsidiary was killed when an aeroplane in which he was travelling in the course of his employment crashed. The proceeds of the policy were paid to the taxpayer company. The Commissioner contended that the amount was received as ""income"" in the ordinary sense of the word. It will be noted that there was no question that the amount was received, the issue being as to its proper characterisation. 132 The High Court held that the amount was in the nature of income because it was intended to provide against loss of dividend income the taxpayer might suffer in consequence of the death or disablement of employees of its subsidiaries. In their joint judgment, Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ said (at 663 664) that the insurance monies must be considered as having been gained in the course of the parent company's business, using ""business"" in ""the broad sense which makes it relevant to the tax problem, that is to say as meaning the continuous course of conduct which the appellant was following for the derivation of income"". 133 It is common ground that the dividend of $49 million was ""income"" and I accept that ABB Zurich was carrying on business. I do not see, however, how these circumstances or the decision in Carapark determine the criterion by virtue of which, and therefore the time at which, ABB Zurich derives income consisting of dividends declared by its subsidiaries. Neither Carapark nor any other authority of which I am aware equates any form of ""carrying on of business"" at all with the trading or manufacturing activity that has been referred to as exceptional in the cases."
Case382,cited,Charter Reinsurance Co Ltd v Fagan [1997] AC 313,"In Charter Reinsurance Co Ltd v Fagan [1997] AC 313 Lord Mustill described the word ""paid"" as a ""slippery"" word (at 384). In the present case, it is not in dispute that the debtor, ABB Australia, paid the amount of its indebtedness on 21 June 1996: the question is whether the payment it then made to BAL was also payment to ABB Zurich. 164 Essential to the notion of payment is the agreement of a creditor to accept something as payment. If a creditor directs the debtor to pay to a third party to whom the creditor has an obligation and the debtor does so, the payment to the third party is payment to the creditor because the creditor has consented to treat it as such. Take the ordinary case of the application of s 44(1) of the Act to the declaration of a final dividend payable immediately. Could it be seriously suggested that it was not paid to the shareholder because it was paid to a third party at the direction of the shareholder? It would have been paid to the shareholder even absent the inclusory definition of ""paid"" in s 6(1). 165 Even a payment into a creditor's bank account is a payment to a third party, namely, the bank. The payment is made on the basis that the amount will be credited to the creditor's account with the bank, and we have no difficulty in saying that the debtor has ""paid"" the creditor."

His Honour stated (at 445 446): With respect to his Honour, who presumably must be taken as having decided otherwise, I do not think that the accounting evidence in the present case establishes that the amount derived each year by applying the financial or actuarial method represents income in ordinary concepts. What that evidence establishes is that the outcome of the finance or actuarial method is an appropriate figure to be used in the preparation of the profit and loss account of the respondent for the year in accordance with the Companies (New South Wales) Code : s 269(1). If the relevant issue were the determination of the profit of the respondents, or whether that profit was to be seen as on revenue account, the evidence would clearly be most cogent. But it must be remembered that the role of the accounting standards is in the determination of profit so as to ensure that financial statements, required to be prepared by statute, give a true and fair view and not the determination of ""income"", notwithstanding that those two concepts may, as will be seen, sometimes overlap. Thus Professor Walker [an expert witness] states that he has been asked to advise as to the correct method of accounting in relation to the leases in question. But his affidavit and subsequent explanation makes it clear that he has answered that question by reference to the companies law for the purposes of which the relevant standards have been prepared and with which of course each of the respondents was obliged to comply. Mr Westworth's affidavit [regarding accounting practices] makes clear that he too has addressed himself to that issue, not relevant in the present proceedings. All that may be said is that if there be no impediment in the Act to bringing into account, in a case such as the present, a net profit figure as gross income, then that profit figure will need to be calculated in accordance with the accounting standards. The real issue for decision is rather a question of construction of the Act, namely, whether in a case such as the present, the scheme of the Act precludes treating as gross income the net profit calculated in accordance with the financial or actuarial method. Hill J noted earlier, however, that accounting evidence was often relevant and often highly significant in resolving issues under the Act. He gave as an example the issue whether a cash receipts or accruals basis of accounting will give ""a true reflex of the income derived by a taxpayer"" (at 443, citing Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 his Honour also cited Arthur Murray [1965] HCA 58 ; 114 CLR 314)."
Case385,cited,Commissioner of Taxation (Commonwealth) v Sun Alliance Investments Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] HCA 70 ; (2005) 225 CLR 488,"In Commissioner of Taxation (Commonwealth) v Sun Alliance Investments Pty Limited (in liq) [2005] HCA 70 ; (2005) 225 CLR 488, the High Court in a joint judgment, drew attention to the fact that the meaning of the word ""derived"" in a particular provision could not be ascertained without at least some reference to the thing said to be derived (in that case, the profits of the company) (at [42]). In particular their Honours cautioned against conflating the concept of derivation of income with derivation of profits. Their Honours referred to the fact that for the most part the notion of ""income"" directs attention to ""receipts"" by a taxpayer. Their Honours further referred to the late Professor RW Parsons's work, Income Taxation in Australia (The Law Book Company, 1985) in which the learned author stated (at [2.10]): ""For the most part, the law expresses an ordinary usage notion of derivation of a receipt"". I do not think that their Honours or the late learned author were intending to exclude the possibility that business and accounting practice might demonstrate, in the case of the particular category of income, that it is derived at a time other than upon receipt. Arthur Murray [1965] HCA 58 ; 114 CLR 314 stands against the existence of any such universal rule."

Case387,followed,Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited [1938] HCA 69 ; (1938) 63 CLR 108,"The authorities cited by the applicants are St Lucia Usines and Estates Company Limited v Colonial Treasurer of St Lucia [1924] AC 508 ( St Lucia ) at 512; Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited [1938] HCA 69 ; (1938) 63 CLR 108 ( Carden's Case ) at 155; Permanent Trustee Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1940) 6 ATD 5 ( Prior's Case ) at 13; South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235 at 253; and Bowaters Sales Co Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1958) 38 TC 593 ( Bowaters ) at 597 599. As well, the applicants refer to the Commissioner's Public Ruling TR 98/1 at [19], in which the Commissioner has said that as a general rule, the receipts method is appropriate to determine income derived from investments, although there are exceptions, such as in the case of interest from a business of money lending carried on by the taxpayer. 68 Like the applicants, the Commissioner relies on the seminal judgment of Dixon J in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108. The Commissioner refers to his Honour's statements to the effect that the tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the conceptions of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy (at 153), and that unless some definite direction is discoverable in the statute, the choice of the method of ascertaining ""the true income"" must depend upon the method's ""actual appropriateness"" (at 154). 103 I turn next to the judgment of Dixon J in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 a seminal judgment on the question of the appropriateness of the receipts or accrual method of tax accounting for income derived. 104 The case concerned the income of a medical practitioner subsequently deceased. The issue arose under the Taxation Act 1927 1935 (SA). A question before the Court was whether the earnings or accruals method of identifying the deceased's fees income was appropriate. 105 Dixon J, with whom Rich and McTiernan JJ agreed (Latham CJ dissenting), held that the receipts basis of accounting (on which Dr Carden had furnished returns) had been the appropriate method in relation to the complete years of income during Dr Carden's lifetime (the earnings basis was held appropriate for the broken period from 1 July 1935 to his death on 15 November 1935). Accordingly, Dr Carden had not been required to return as income fees earned during those years but not paid during them, which were outstanding as ""book debts"" at the end of those years. 106 The following propositions are to be found in the judgment of Dixon J: (1) The question which of rival methods of accounting should be employed in identifying taxable income falls for the courts to determine according to legal principles, but it is a mistake to search only the legislative text for an answer, because such notions as income, profits and gains are conceptions of the world of affairs, and particularly of business, covering an infinite variety of activities, for which no single formula can be devised (at 151 152). (2) ""... in nearly every department of enterprise and employment the course of affairs and the practice of business have developed methods of estimating or computing in terms of money the result over an interval of time produced by the operations of business, by the work of the individual, or by the use of capital. The practice of these methods of computation and the general recognition of the principles upon which they proceed are responsible in a great measure for the conceptions of income, profit and gain and, therefore, may be said to enter into the determination or definition of the subject which the legislature has undertaken to tax. The courts have always regarded the ascertainment of income as governed by the principles recognized or followed in business and commerce, unless the legislature has itself made some specific provision affecting a particular matter or question"" (at 152). (3) ""The tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the conceptions of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy ... But the process by which the principles and practices evolved in business or general affairs are drawn upon for the solution of questions presented to courts of law almost inevitably leads to a development in the law itself. For, under our system of precedent, a decision adopting or resorting to any given accounting principle or application of principle is almost bound to settle for the future the rule to be observed and the rule thus comes to look very like a proposition of law"" (at 153 154). (4) ""Unless in the statute itself some definite direction is discoverable, ... the admissibility of the method which in fact has been pursued must depend upon its actual appropriateness ... [t]he inquiry should be whether in the circumstances of the case it is calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer's true income. We are so accustomed to commercial accounts of manufacturing or trading operations, where the object is to show the gain upon a comparison of the respective positions at the beginning and end of a period of production or trading, that it is easy to forget the reasons which underlie the application of such a method of accounting to the purpose of ascertaining taxable income. Although the field of profit-making which it covers in practice is probably much greater than any other among the manifold forms of income or revenue, it is a system of accounting which does not represent the primary or basal position from which an investigation of income for taxation purposes begins. Speaking generally, in the assessment of income the object is to discover what gains have during the period of account come home to the taxpayer in a realized or immediately realizable form"" (at 154 155). (5) The expressions ""derived"" and ""arising or accruing"" ordinarily signify receipt, but not in relation to debts due to a trading company, in which case debts due but not paid must be included as income. With regard to non-trading income there must be something ""coming in"", that is to say, ""for income tax purposes receivability without receipt is nothing"" (at 155 quoting from Sir Houldsworth Shaw &amp; Baker, Law of Income Tax p111). (6) ""The reasons which underlie the practice of estimating for taxation purposes the income from trade or manufacture by means of a commercial profit and loss account consist in the impracticability of computing income in any other way and in the adoption for fiscal purposes of recognized commercial principles. The computation of profits from manufacture and trading has always proceeded upon the principle that profit may be contained in stock-in-trade and 'outstandings'"" (at 155). (7) ""... a tax upon the profits or income of such a business [a manufacturing or trading business] must be understood as a tax upon the profits or income computed according to the system, because, according to common understanding and commercial principles, that is the method of determining the profits"" (at 156). (8) The word ""derived"" is the equivalent of ""arising or accruing"" ( Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; (1917) 23 CLR 119 at 133), and none of these three words, nor the words ""income"", ""profit"" or ""gain"" in the statute, throw any light on the question of which basis of accounting is appropriate to reflect income in the circumstances of a particular case (at 157). (9) ""Where there is nothing analogous to a stock of vendible articles to be acquired or produced and carried by the taxpayer, where outstandings on the expenditure side do not correspond to, and are not naturally connected with, the outstandings on the earnings side, and where there is no fund of circulating capital from which income or profit must be detached for actual enjoyment, but where, on the contrary, the receipts represent in substance a reward for professional skill and personal work to which the expenditure on the other side of the account contributes only in a subsidiary or minor degree, then I think according to ordinary conceptions the receipts basis forms a fair and appropriate foundation for estimating professional income. But this is subject to one qualification. There must be continuity in the practice of the profession"" (at 157 158). 107 The factual circumstances of Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 are also far removed from those of the present case. Dixon J's reasons suggest, however, three things. First, we should expect to be able to identify the meaning and timing of the derivation of dividend income, not necessarily simply by exploring the text of the Act, such as the term ""income"" or the term ""derived"", but by reference to relevant business and accounting practice. Second, trading and manufacturing companies have particular features that make an accrual or earnings basis appropriate for them, that are not features of a group holding company such as ABB Zurich, namely, a depletion in a stock of vendible articles on one side of the ledger that would be apt to give a misleading picture as to the company's gain or loss over a period if the corresponding earnings (book debts) arising from the depletion during that period were not shown as income on the other side of the ledger. Third, generally speaking, in order to see whether income has been derived, we should ask whether the income has come home to the taxpayer in a realised or immediately realisable form. 108 Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 suggests that in the absence of features taking the case out of the ordinary or evidence of business and accounting practice pointing to a different result, I should treat the present dividend as income derived if and when it came home to ABB Zurich in a realised or immediately realisable form. 109 Prior's Case 6 ATD 5 was concerned with the application of s 19 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922 33 to a capitalisation by a Deed of Dissolution of Partnership dated 13 August 1932, and therefore within the financial year ended 30 June 1933, of an amount of &#8356;2,097 that represented a balance of interest outstanding by one former partner to the other. The sum of &#8356;2,097 was included in a sum of &#8356;8,388 that was agreed to represent the total amount owing by the former partner to the other. As part of the agreement on dissolution, the amount of &#8356;8,388 was secured by a charge ""on property already heavily mortgaged and quite incapable of producing a surplus out of which the amount representing interest could be paid"" (at 13). 110 The interest was not paid but was carried to a capital account, and in that sense capitalised. Section 19 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922 1933 was all but identical to s 19 of the Act (set out at [9] above the words ""or money"" did not appear in the earlier version). Rich J, with whom Starke and McTiernan JJ agreed, considered that the facts showed that the taxpayer got nothing except a new obligation to pay in exchange for the existing obligation to pay, which made him ""no nearer getting his money or of transferring it into anything of any value"" (at 12). Rather colourfully, his Honour said: ""[a]ll that happened in this case was to change a forlorn hope of interest into a still more forlorn hope of capital"" (ibid). Rich J thought that in order to see whether income is being derived, ""one must look to realities"", adding that while usually payment of interest by cheque involves receipt of income, ""payment by a valueless cheque does not"" (at 13). Like Dixon J in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108, his Honour also quoted from Sir Houldsworth Shaw &amp; Baker, Law of Income Tax , p111: ""for income tax purposes receivability without receipt is nothing"". 111 Prior's Case 6 ATD 5 stands for the proposition that s 19 is not engaged where there is no increase in the taxpayer's resources. There was such an increase in the resources of ABB Zurich upon declaration of the dividend. It was certain that the dividend would be paid; it was ABB Zurich's decision to fix a future date for payment; and immediately after declaration of the dividend ABB Zurich was able to sell the right to be paid it. Prior's Case is therefore of little relevance to the present case. 112 Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1965] HCA 58 ; (1965) 114 CLR 314 ( Arthur Murray ) was, in a sense, the converse of Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108. The taxpayer company received fees for dancing lessons yet to be given. It placed the fees in a suspense account until the lessons were given, when it transferred them to its revenue account. The High Court held that the fees were not assessable income at the time of receipt. 113 In their joint judgment, Barwick CJ, Kitto and Taylor JJ said that Dixon J's reference in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 to monies having ""come home"" to the taxpayer, was a reference, not simply to receipt, but to the reaching of a situation in which monies received might properly be counted as gains completely made, so that there was neither legal nor business unsoundness in regarding them, without qualification, as income derived. Their Honours stated (at 318): The ultimate inquiry in either kind of case, of course, must be whether that which has taken place, be it the earning or the receipt, is enough by itself to satisfy the general understanding among practical business people of what constitutes a derivation of income. A conclusion as to what that understanding is may be assisted by considering standard accountancy methods, for they have been evolved in the business community for the very purpose of reflecting received opinions as to the sound view to take of particular kinds of items. ... A judicial decision as to whether an amount received but not yet earned or an amount earned but not yet received is income must depend basically upon the judicial understanding of the meaning which the word conveys to those whose concern it is to observe the distinctions it implies. What ultimately matters is the concept; book-keeping methods are but evidence of the concept. Their Honours noted that it was agreed that according to established accountancy and commercial principles, in the case of a business selling goods or supplying services, amounts received in advance of the goods being delivered or the services supplied are not regarded as income until the goods are delivered or the services supplied. 114 Their Honours recognised that where statute lays down a test for the inclusion of particular kinds of receipts in assessable income, commercial and accounting practice cannot be substituted for the test, but said there was no such test in the case before the Court, the only relevant word being ""income"", which was to be understood according to ""the vocabulary of business affairs"" (at 320). 115 Subsection (1) of s 128B does not, in my view, lay down a test of the kind contemplated by their Honours. The subsection invokes the notion of ""income ... derived"", and I am required to have regard to general commercial and accounting practice, if evidence of it is put before the Court, as to when income consisting of a dividend declared in the circumstances of the present case is regarded as having ""come home"" to the parent company. 116 In South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235, Dixon J's judgment in Carden's Case was again referred to by the High Court. In a joint judgment, Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (at 252) that in accordance with Dixon J's statement in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 at 152 (see [106] (1), (2) above), ""the courts have placed reliance upon the conceptions of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy in order to arrive at an assessment of income, the object being 'to discover what gains have during the period of account come home to the taxpayer in a realised or immediately realizable form'"" (their Honours were quoting from Dixon J in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 at 155). 146 In Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 434, Hill J, with whom Jenkinson and Einfeld JJ agreed, cautioned against a too ready reliance on business and accounting practice relating to preparation of the company's profit and loss account required in accordance with s 269(1) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code (at 443 446). His Honour stated (at 445 446): With respect to his Honour, who presumably must be taken as having decided otherwise, I do not think that the accounting evidence in the present case establishes that the amount derived each year by applying the financial or actuarial method represents income in ordinary concepts. What that evidence establishes is that the outcome of the finance or actuarial method is an appropriate figure to be used in the preparation of the profit and loss account of the respondent for the year in accordance with the Companies (New South Wales) Code : s 269(1). If the relevant issue were the determination of the profit of the respondents, or whether that profit was to be seen as on revenue account, the evidence would clearly be most cogent. But it must be remembered that the role of the accounting standards is in the determination of profit so as to ensure that financial statements, required to be prepared by statute, give a true and fair view and not the determination of ""income"", notwithstanding that those two concepts may, as will be seen, sometimes overlap. Thus Professor Walker [an expert witness] states that he has been asked to advise as to the correct method of accounting in relation to the leases in question. But his affidavit and subsequent explanation makes it clear that he has answered that question by reference to the companies law for the purposes of which the relevant standards have been prepared and with which of course each of the respondents was obliged to comply. Mr Westworth's affidavit [regarding accounting practices] makes clear that he too has addressed himself to that issue, not relevant in the present proceedings. All that may be said is that if there be no impediment in the Act to bringing into account, in a case such as the present, a net profit figure as gross income, then that profit figure will need to be calculated in accordance with the accounting standards. The real issue for decision is rather a question of construction of the Act, namely, whether in a case such as the present, the scheme of the Act precludes treating as gross income the net profit calculated in accordance with the financial or actuarial method. Hill J noted earlier, however, that accounting evidence was often relevant and often highly significant in resolving issues under the Act. He gave as an example the issue whether a cash receipts or accruals basis of accounting will give ""a true reflex of the income derived by a taxpayer"" (at 443, citing Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 his Honour also cited Arthur Murray [1965] HCA 58 ; 114 CLR 314)."
Case388,discussed,Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) v Stevenson [1937] HCA 72 ; (1937) 59 CLR 80,"In Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) v Stevenson [1937] HCA 72 ; (1937) 59 CLR 80 ( Stevenson ), Evatt J stated in relation to s 11(b) of the Income Tax (Management) Act 1928 (NSW), which referred to ""dividends ... credited, paid, or distributed to the member or shareholder"", that the words ""credited"", ""paid"" and ""distributed"" were concerned with the manner in which a shareholder ""receives the benefit of the dividend"" (at 108). 170 I acknowledge that Jolly [1933] HCA 63 ; 50 CLR 131 and Stevenson [1937] HCA 72 ; 59 CLR 80 concerned more than simply the word ""paid"", and that Jolly involved the discharge of indebtedness of the shareholder to the company. I suggest, however, that the general tenor of the passages quoted is that ""payment"" can take such form of satisfaction of the dividend debt as the shareholder may have agreed to accept, whether that agreement is contained in the company's articles of association or is external to them."
Case389,cited,Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510,"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does. It will then hold the benefit of the obligor's undertaking upon a constructive trust for the assignee, even if specific performance of the contract to assign between assignor and assignee could not have been obtained by the assignee previously. As Lord Millett summarises the position, ""[t]he trust ceases to be defeasible or contingent; the vendor becomes a fiduciary; and the purchaser has all the remedies of a beneficiary under an ordinary trust"", citing Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187) esp per Lord Cranworth at 683 4 (ER 1192), and see also Lake v Bayliss [1974] 2 All ER 1114."

Case392,distinguished,Esquire Nominees Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 32 ; (1973) 129 CLR 177,"The Commissioner submits that for the purposes of identifying the appropriate basis of accounting, the authorities show or suggest that a holding company is classified as a trading company. He cites Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1966) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ) at 663 664; Esquire Nominees Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 32 ; (1973) 129 CLR 177 ( Esquire Nominees ) at 212 per Barwick CJ, 221 per Menzies J; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 ( Brookton ) at 469 per Aickin J; and Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 99 ATC 5193 ( BHP v FCT ) at [48] per Kenny J. 134 The Commissioner relies on a statement in Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 by Barwick CJ (at 212) that a company may make profits without trading in goods or commodities, or, for that matter, in securities, and that it may do so simply through its investment portfolio, indeed, through investment in a single subsidiary. 135 Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 concerned an issue over the location of the source from which income was derived. The taxpayer company, Esquire Nominees Ltd, was incorporated in Norfolk Island, as was Mitchell Credits Ltd. Each had its registered office and central management and control in Norfolk Island. In the year ended 30 June 1969, Esquire Nominees Ltd received a dividend from Mitchell Credits Ltd. Mitchell Credits Ltd derived the funds for the payment of the dividend from a dividend which it received from Pharmaceutical Investments Ltd, which was also incorporated in Norfolk Island. That company paid the dividend to Mitchell Credits Ltd from funds constituted by a dividend it received from an Australian company, whose income came from dividends paid to it by another Australian company carrying on business in Australia. 136 Barwick CJ (at 212) said that the place where a company makes its investment income is the place where it has its central management and control, whereas the place where a trading or manufacturing company makes its income is the place where its trading or manufacturing activities are carried on. 137 The High Court held that Esquire Nominees Ltd was a resident of Norfolk Island and that the source of the dividend, the fund out of which Mitchell Credits Ltd declared it, was within Norfolk Island. 139 The Commissioner also refers to a passage in the judgment of Aickin J in Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441. His Honour stated (at 469) that in the case of a company that had no activity other than the receipt of dividends from shares that it had purchased, it would ordinarily be regarded as carrying on a business, even if it did not actively manage its portfolio of investments, whereas an individual in the same circumstances would not necessarily be regarded as carrying on such a business. Aickin J cited Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 at 212 per Barwick CJ and 221 per Menzies J. Again, the statement is relevant only to the question whether ABB Zurich carried on a business. I accept that it did. 140 Finally, the Commissioner relies on BHP v FCT 99 ATC 5193, in which Kenny J said (at [48]) that the taxpayer company carried on businesses which included holding shares in, and managing, its subsidiaries. Her Honour stated, citing Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 and Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441, that the holding of shares in subsidiaries can of itself constitute the carrying of a business for the purposes of s 51(1) of the Act."
Case393,cited,Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128,"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does. It will then hold the benefit of the obligor's undertaking upon a constructive trust for the assignee, even if specific performance of the contract to assign between assignor and assignee could not have been obtained by the assignee previously. As Lord Millett summarises the position, ""[t]he trust ceases to be defeasible or contingent; the vendor becomes a fiduciary; and the purchaser has all the remedies of a beneficiary under an ordinary trust"", citing Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187) esp per Lord Cranworth at 683 4 (ER 1192), and see also Lake v Bayliss [1974] 2 All ER 1114."
Case394,cited,Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; (1917) 23 CLR 119,"The following propositions are to be found in the judgment of Dixon J: (1) The question which of rival methods of accounting should be employed in identifying taxable income falls for the courts to determine according to legal principles, but it is a mistake to search only the legislative text for an answer, because such notions as income, profits and gains are conceptions of the world of affairs, and particularly of business, covering an infinite variety of activities, for which no single formula can be devised (at 151 152). (2) ""... in nearly every department of enterprise and employment the course of affairs and the practice of business have developed methods of estimating or computing in terms of money the result over an interval of time produced by the operations of business, by the work of the individual, or by the use of capital. The practice of these methods of computation and the general recognition of the principles upon which they proceed are responsible in a great measure for the conceptions of income, profit and gain and, therefore, may be said to enter into the determination or definition of the subject which the legislature has undertaken to tax. The courts have always regarded the ascertainment of income as governed by the principles recognized or followed in business and commerce, unless the legislature has itself made some specific provision affecting a particular matter or question"" (at 152). (3) ""The tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the conceptions of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy ... But the process by which the principles and practices evolved in business or general affairs are drawn upon for the solution of questions presented to courts of law almost inevitably leads to a development in the law itself. For, under our system of precedent, a decision adopting or resorting to any given accounting principle or application of principle is almost bound to settle for the future the rule to be observed and the rule thus comes to look very like a proposition of law"" (at 153 154). (4) ""Unless in the statute itself some definite direction is discoverable, ... the admissibility of the method which in fact has been pursued must depend upon its actual appropriateness ... [t]he inquiry should be whether in the circumstances of the case it is calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer's true income. We are so accustomed to commercial accounts of manufacturing or trading operations, where the object is to show the gain upon a comparison of the respective positions at the beginning and end of a period of production or trading, that it is easy to forget the reasons which underlie the application of such a method of accounting to the purpose of ascertaining taxable income. Although the field of profit-making which it covers in practice is probably much greater than any other among the manifold forms of income or revenue, it is a system of accounting which does not represent the primary or basal position from which an investigation of income for taxation purposes begins. Speaking generally, in the assessment of income the object is to discover what gains have during the period of account come home to the taxpayer in a realized or immediately realizable form"" (at 154 155). (5) The expressions ""derived"" and ""arising or accruing"" ordinarily signify receipt, but not in relation to debts due to a trading company, in which case debts due but not paid must be included as income. With regard to non-trading income there must be something ""coming in"", that is to say, ""for income tax purposes receivability without receipt is nothing"" (at 155 quoting from Sir Houldsworth Shaw &amp; Baker, Law of Income Tax p111). (6) ""The reasons which underlie the practice of estimating for taxation purposes the income from trade or manufacture by means of a commercial profit and loss account consist in the impracticability of computing income in any other way and in the adoption for fiscal purposes of recognized commercial principles. The computation of profits from manufacture and trading has always proceeded upon the principle that profit may be contained in stock-in-trade and 'outstandings'"" (at 155). (7) ""... a tax upon the profits or income of such a business [a manufacturing or trading business] must be understood as a tax upon the profits or income computed according to the system, because, according to common understanding and commercial principles, that is the method of determining the profits"" (at 156). (8) The word ""derived"" is the equivalent of ""arising or accruing"" ( Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; (1917) 23 CLR 119 at 133), and none of these three words, nor the words ""income"", ""profit"" or ""gain"" in the statute, throw any light on the question of which basis of accounting is appropriate to reflect income in the circumstances of a particular case (at 157). (9) ""Where there is nothing analogous to a stock of vendible articles to be acquired or produced and carried by the taxpayer, where outstandings on the expenditure side do not correspond to, and are not naturally connected with, the outstandings on the earnings side, and where there is no fund of circulating capital from which income or profit must be detached for actual enjoyment, but where, on the contrary, the receipts represent in substance a reward for professional skill and personal work to which the expenditure on the other side of the account contributes only in a subsidiary or minor degree, then I think according to ordinary conceptions the receipts basis forms a fair and appropriate foundation for estimating professional income. But this is subject to one qualification. There must be continuity in the practice of the profession"" (at 157 158). 128 Bowaters 38 TC 593 is said to be against the Commissioner's contention in the present case. I note that I do not see any relevant distinction between the concepts ""arising"" in ss 19 and 20(1) of the Finance Act 1937 (UK) and ""derived"" in the Australian s 128B(1): see Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; 23 CLR 119 at 133 noted at [106] above."
Case395,cited,Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999),"With reference to the eighth proposition, I note that the idea that the legal chose in action is held on trust after the consideration is paid in full is well accepted in the case law; see for example, the Australian cases Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1 at 26 27 and McIntyre v Gye (1994) 51 FCR 472 at 480 481, and the cases referred to in Meagher RP, Heydon JD and Leeming MJ, Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6-050]. The operative principle is that equity regards as done that which ought to be done, the assignor's conscience being bound to that end: Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999); Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523. There is, however, criticism of descriptions of the purchaser's equitable interest between contract and payment of the purchase money as that of a beneficiary under a trust; see for example Heydon JD and Loughlan PL, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (6 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6.7], [6.16] [6.18]. Dr Tolhurst goes further and suggests (op cit, [4.07]) an ""assignment analysis"" according to which, even in the former class of case (where the consideration for the assignment has been paid), a trust of the legal chose is unnecessary except as a remedial device granted by the court. In such a case, however, the case law is all one way in favour of a constructive trust arising as a matter of substantive law. In any event, his Lordship's evidence to that effect was not challenged."
Case396,cited,Industrial Equity Limited v Blackburn [1977] HCA 59 ; (1977) 137 CLR 567,"Prior to the introduction of those provisions, there was a well established distinction between final and interim dividends. A declaration of a final dividend by the shareholders gave rise to an immediate debt owed by the company to the shareholders, whereas a resolution by the directors to pay an interim dividend did not do so: Potel v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] 2 All ER 504 at 511 512; Industrial Equity Limited v Blackburn [1977] HCA 59 ; (1977) 137 CLR 567 at 572; Marra Developments Ltd v BW Rofe Pty Ltd [1977] 2 NSWLR 616 at 625; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 at 455. Thus, a declaration of a final dividend could not be revoked and the company's indebtedness to its shareholders eliminated, if profits ceased to be available to fund the dividend between the time of the declaration and the time fixed for payment. A decision of the directors to pay an interim dividend, on the other hand, could always be revoked down to the time fixed for payment."
Case397,discussed,Jolly v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1933] HCA 63 ; (1934) 50 CLR 131,"In Jolly v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1933] HCA 63 ; (1934) 50 CLR 131 ( Jolly ), Dixon J summarised the effect of two earlier High Court decisions on the description of income in s 14(b) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1921 (Cth), to include ""dividends, interest, profits or bonus credited or paid to any member, shareholder, or debentureholder of a company which derives income from a source in Australia"" (the two earlier cases were Webb v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1922] HCA 27 ; (1922) 30 CLR 450 and James v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1924] HCA 34 ; (1924) 34 CLR 404). His Honour stated that whatever else the provision might include, it extended to ""all profits that a company allocated as such to all or some class of its members severally, and, under lawful authority appropriates in discharge of claims to which they are individually liable"" (at 142). 170 I acknowledge that Jolly [1933] HCA 63 ; 50 CLR 131 and Stevenson [1937] HCA 72 ; 59 CLR 80 concerned more than simply the word ""paid"", and that Jolly involved the discharge of indebtedness of the shareholder to the company. I suggest, however, that the general tenor of the passages quoted is that ""payment"" can take such form of satisfaction of the dividend debt as the shareholder may have agreed to accept, whether that agreement is contained in the company's articles of association or is external to them."

This third submission depends largely, though not entirely, on Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1963] HCA 21 ; (1963) 109 CLR 9 ( Norman ). 36 I will elaborate on the parties' submissions below. 37 In their outline of opening, the applicants set out the following facts which, although elaborated upon by the Commissioner as noted below, were not in issue between the parties: Parties [ABB Australia] (formerly called Asea Brown Boveri Pty Limited) ... is a company: (a) incorporated pursuant to the laws of New South Wales; (b) the issued capital of which during the period from (at least) 1 May 1996 to 30 June 1996 comprised 53,072,944 ordinary shares of A$1.50 each and 42,827,055 ordinary shares of A$1.00 each, all of which were registered in the name of the Second Applicant (as beneficial owner) except for 1 ordinary share of $1.00 which was registered in the name of Patelhold Patentverwertungs und Elektro Holding AG on bare trust for the Second Applicant (as beneficial owner); (b) which is, and was at all material times, a resident of Australia for the purposes of [the 1936 Act]. [ABB Zurich] is a company: (a) incorporated pursuant to the laws of Switzerland; (b) which is, and was at all material times, a non-resident of Australia for the purposes of the 1936 Act. [BZW] is a company: (a) incorporated pursuant to the laws of England and Wales; (b) which was at all material times a non-resident of Australia for the purposes of the 1936 Act. [BAL] is a company: (a) incorporated pursuant to the laws of New South Wales; (b) which was at all material times a resident of Australia for the purposes of the 1936 Act. Declaration of the Dividend On 22 May 1996, the directors of ABB Australia resolved that the declaration and payment of a final dividend of A$49,000,000 for the year ended 31 December 1995 payable on 21 June 1996 to the registered shareholders of the company as at 30 May 1996 be recommended to the shareholders at an annual general meeting. On 30 May 1996, in accordance with Article 82 of the Articles of Association of ABB Australia, the members of the company resolved at an annual general meeting that a final dividend of A$49,000,000 be paid to members holding shares in the company as at 30 May 1996 and that the dividend be payable on 21 June 1996 (the "" Dividend "").

The First Offer, which was expressed to be governed by English law, included terms to the following effect: (a) the consideration payable by BZW to ABB Zurich for the assignment was a sum payable in Australian dollars calculated in accordance with the formula set out in Appendix 1 to the First Offer (the "" Price ""), which was ultimately determined to be A$48,816,995; (b) the Price was payable to ABB Zurich by wire transfer no later than 5 June 1996; (c) following acceptance of the offer, ABB Zurich would give a direction to ABB Australia to pay the Dividend to such bank account as shall be designated by BZW or a ""Permitted Assign""; (d) ABB Zurich agreed that BZW may without the consent of ABB Zurich, assign to a Permitted Assign the benefit of all or any of ABB Zurich's obligations under the First Offer and/or any benefit arising under or out of the First Offer. BZW did not give notice to ABB Australia of the assignment of ABB Zurich's right to receive the Dividend. On 4 June 1996, in Zurich, Switzerland: (a) BZW made an offer in writing to BAL (the "" Second Offer "") to assign to BAL all of BZW's right to receive the Dividend and the benefits of the First Offer; (b) the Second Offer was accepted by Mr B Gill, as attorney for BAL, orally in accordance with its terms. The Second Offer, which is also expressed to be governed by English law, provided that the consideration payable by BAL to BZW for the assignment was the amount of A$48,826,480. On 5 June 1996: (a) BAL paid the consideration for the assignment under the Second Offer (being the amount of A$48,826,480) to BZW; (b) BZW paid the Price (being the amount of A$48,816,995) to ABB Zurich; (c) BAL gave to ABB Zurich written notice of the assignment under the Second Offer and a written request that ABB Zurich instruct ABB Australia to pay the amount of A$49,000,000 in respect of the Dividend to an identified bank account of BAL at the National Australia Bank in Sydney ""for value 21 June 1996"". On 6 June 1996, ABB Zurich gave to ABB Australia a written direction which provided relevantly as follows: ""You are irrevocably directed to pay the debt of AUD 49,000,000 due and owing by you to ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd, Zurich, Switzerland, to Barclays Australia Limited, 22 nd Floor, 255 George Street, GPO Box 4675, Sydney NSW 2001, Australia. The payment must be made for value 21 June 1996 to the following account [there followed particulars of an agreement at the National Australia Bank in Sydney]. Payment of the Dividend On 20 June 1996, ABB Australia, by special resolution passed at a duly convened meeting of its members, amended its Articles of Association by the addition of a new Article 82(3) as follows: ""Members may at any time by way of a written notice direct the Company to pay the amount of any dividend declared pursuant to Article 82(1) to a party nominated in that Notice. The company shall on receipt of any such Notice pay the dividend in accordance with the terms of the Notice."" On 21 June 1996, ABB Australia paid the amount of $49,000,000 to BAL in accordance with the direction referred to ... above. On or about 30 June 1996, the payment of the Dividend was recorded in the accounts of ABB Australia by the following journal entry: Dr Retained Earnings Dividend Paid $49,000,000 Cr Monies on deposit ABB $49,000,000. Apart from the accounting entry referred to in the previous paragraph, no other originating entry (being a debit or credit entry) was made in the books of ABB Australia in respect of the debt arising on the declaration of the Dividend or its payment. Dispute with the Respondent On 16 December 2003 the Respondent sent a letter to ABB Australia which stated that ABB Australia was obliged pursuant to s.221YL(1) of the 1936 Act to make a deduction from the Dividend when it was paid on 21 June 1996 which was not made, and required ABB Australia to pay to him pursuant to s.221YQ(1) of the 1936 Act an amount of $15,540,581.40 comprising unpaid withholding tax of $7,350,000, unpaid additional tax by way of penalty of $3,082,367.90 and unpaid general interest charge of $5,108,213.50. Also on 16 December 2003, the Respondent sent a letter to ABB Zurich which stated that ABB Zurich was liable to pay withholding tax, pursuant to s.128B and s.128C of the 1936 Act, in respect of the Dividend, and required ABB Zurich to pay to him the amount of $15,540,581.40 comprising unpaid withholding tax of $7,350,000, unpaid additional tax by way of penalty of $3,082,367.90 and unpaid general interest charge of $5,108,213.50. 189 The Commissioner relies, first, on Norman [1963] HCA 21 ; 109 CLR 9 at 16 per Dixon CJ. 190 In Norman , by deed dated 21 December 1956 a taxpayer purported to assign to his wife by way of gift, relevantly, all the interest, dividends and other income arising from two estates in which the taxpayer had a beneficial interest. Subsequently, company shares representing the taxpayer's interest in the estates were transferred to him and he was registered as the shareholder in respect of them. In the year of income ended 30 June 1958, after the shares had been transferred to the taxpayer, dividends were declared on them. The companies posted to the taxpayer cheques for the dividends drawn in his favour. He endorsed them when necessary and had them paid into his wife's bank account a practice of which his wife was aware. The companies had no notice of the deed. 191 The amounts of the dividends were returned as income of the taxpayer's wife, but the Commissioner contended that they should have been returned as income of the taxpayer. 192 In the passage (at 16) cited, Dixon CJ stated: So far as the dividend is concerned, I think the structure of s 44 of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1958 makes it impossible that future undeclared dividends should be assigned by the shareholder so as to exclude him from liability to include the dividends when declared in his assessable income. Section 44 and the sections which follow are framed to deal specially with the case of members of companies who are entitled to dividends. The whole question of tax upon the profits of companies is dealt with specially in the Act, including the scheme relating to rebates. It would become impossible if a shareholder could without transferring his shares assign a future undeclared dividend so as to exclude the operation of the provisions. Menzies J (with whom Owen J agreed) made generally similar comments in relation to the policy underlying s 44(1). Menzies J stated (at 23): I am disposed to think that s 44(1) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act requires that when the taxpayer received the dividends paid to him by the companies in which he was a shareholder, as he did, that those dividends should form part of his assessable income. Of course, had he been a trustee of the shares the provisions of Div 6 of the Act would have applied. 193 The Commissioner submits that the comments made by Dixon CJ and Menzies J in Norman have greater force in relation to the circumstances of the present case because the dividend was declared prior to the equitable assignments, whereas in Norman the deed of assignment preceded the declaration of the dividend. 194 There are several differences between the facts of Norman and those of the present case. In Norman : &#8226; the equitable assignment was by way of gift whereas ABB Zurich contracted to sell for valuable consideration; &#8226; the equitable assignment was of prospective or hoped for future dividends, whereas in the present case the equitable assignments were of an existing debt arising from a declaration of dividend that had already occurred; &#8226; the terms of the declaration of dividends did not provide for a postponement of payment, whereas the terms of the declaration of the dividend in the present case provided for a deferral of payment from 30 May 1996 to 21 June 1996; &#8226; the companies drew the cheques for dividends already due and payable in favour of the taxpayer and posted them to him, and he endorsed them where required and paid them into his wife's bank account, whereas ABB Australia paid the amount of the dividend to BAL. The statement by Dixon CJ refers in terms only to assignment of ""a future undeclared dividend"". The statement by Menzies J refers to the fact that the dividends were paid to the shareholder. 195 The facts in Norman which their Honours must be taken to have had in mind were extreme: the companies, having no notice of the earlier purported gift, drew the dividend cheques in favour of a shareholder and posted them to him. In substance, it was he who effected payment to his wife. 197 The applicants submit that s 44 of the Act cannot determine the capacity of a taxpayer to assign income (while Norman [1963] HCA 21 ; 109 CLR 9 concerned s 44, the Commissioner's submission expressly stated that it proceeded on the basis that s 128B and s 44(1) ""are to be construed consistently""). 198 The applicants further submit: The ""special characteristics"" relied on by the Respondent do not subject the rights in respect of debts arising on the declaration of dividends, or in respect of the future property being the expected dividends, to any different consequences in the case of an assignment. The assignee, of course, takes subject to any disabilities on the subject matter of the assignment flowing from the relationship between the assignor and the company, but this does not preclude assignment nor its tax consequences. It is not to the point that the ""source"" of the dividend is ""an effectuation or realisation of the rights obtained by the acquisition of the share;"" the same could be said in respect of interest and principal, rents and land or royalty and intellectual property. 199 It is not in dispute that the declaration of the dividend gave rise to a debt. I do not understand that there is any dispute that s 12 of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) or the equivalent United Kingdom provision, s 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK), made the debt assignable at law ""subject to equities having priority over the assignee"". The assignment in the present case was not under the statute, but it is useful to note that if it had been, there would, in my opinion, have been no ""equity"" in favour of the Commissioner in respect of withholding tax for three reasons. First, I do not think that the liability of a non-resident to pay withholding tax is an ""equity"" for present purposes. Second, ABB Zurich was not liable to pay withholding tax prior to the assignment, and so the assignment could not take effect ""subject to"" that supposed equity. Third, the ""subject to equities"" qualification relates to the position of the assignee (BAL in the present case) not that of the assignor (ABB Zurich in the present case)."
Case402,cited,Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1,"With reference to the eighth proposition, I note that the idea that the legal chose in action is held on trust after the consideration is paid in full is well accepted in the case law; see for example, the Australian cases Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1 at 26 27 and McIntyre v Gye (1994) 51 FCR 472 at 480 481, and the cases referred to in Meagher RP, Heydon JD and Leeming MJ, Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6-050]. The operative principle is that equity regards as done that which ought to be done, the assignor's conscience being bound to that end: Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999); Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523. There is, however, criticism of descriptions of the purchaser's equitable interest between contract and payment of the purchase money as that of a beneficiary under a trust; see for example Heydon JD and Loughlan PL, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (6 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6.7], [6.16] [6.18]. Dr Tolhurst goes further and suggests (op cit, [4.07]) an ""assignment analysis"" according to which, even in the former class of case (where the consideration for the assignment has been paid), a trust of the legal chose is unnecessary except as a remedial device granted by the court. In such a case, however, the case law is all one way in favour of a constructive trust arising as a matter of substantive law. In any event, his Lordship's evidence to that effect was not challenged."

As well, the applicants refer to the Commissioner's Public Ruling TR 98/1 at [19], in which the Commissioner has said that as a general rule, the receipts method is appropriate to determine income derived from investments, although there are exceptions, such as in the case of interest from a business of money lending carried on by the taxpayer."
Case404,cited,Potel v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] 2 All ER 504,"Prior to the introduction of those provisions, there was a well established distinction between final and interim dividends. A declaration of a final dividend by the shareholders gave rise to an immediate debt owed by the company to the shareholders, whereas a resolution by the directors to pay an interim dividend did not do so: Potel v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] 2 All ER 504 at 511 512; Industrial Equity Limited v Blackburn [1977] HCA 59 ; (1977) 137 CLR 567 at 572; Marra Developments Ltd v BW Rofe Pty Ltd [1977] 2 NSWLR 616 at 625; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 at 455. Thus, a declaration of a final dividend could not be revoked and the company's indebtedness to its shareholders eliminated, if profits ceased to be available to fund the dividend between the time of the declaration and the time fixed for payment. A decision of the directors to pay an interim dividend, on the other hand, could always be revoked down to the time fixed for payment."
Case405,discussed,Re Harry Simpson &amp; Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act 1936 [1964-5] NSWR 603,"The Commissioner relies on the following special characteristics of dividends: (a) that the division of a company's profits among its shareholders by the declaration of a dividend is ""an effectuation or realisation of the rights obtained by the acquisition of the share"" (citing Chief Commissioner of State Revenue (NSW) v Dick Smith Electronics Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 3 ; (2005) 221 CLR 496 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at [25] [26], quoting from the judgment of Dixon J in Archibald Howie Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) [1948] HCA 28 ; (1948) 77 CLR 143 at 153); (b) that in the winding up of a company, debts owed by the company to its members in their capacity as members, including debts arising from the declaration of a dividend, are postponed until all debts owed to, or claims made by, persons other than as members of the company have been satisfied: Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 563A (in 1996 the comparable provision was s 563A of the Corporations Law , which was in identical terms); (c) on an assignment of a debt created by the declaration of a dividend, the debt remains subject to the ""equity"" of the ordinary creditors proving in priority (the Commissioner cites Re Harry Simpson &amp; Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act 1936 [1964-5] NSWR 603 ( Simpson )). 200 The Commissioner's present submission draws attention to certain special features of a dividend debt, and Simpson [1964-65] NSWR 603 exemplifies them. In that case, a company was indebted to shareholders who were trustees of twelve trusts for &#8356;34,471.18s.1d on account of dividends that had been declared. The debt was recorded in the company's books. The trustees notified the company that in accordance with the trusts, a person had elected to become the beneficiary of each trust fund. Accordingly, the company transferred the amount of its indebtedness to the trustees into an account in the name of the beneficiary. 201 Upon liquidation of the company, the beneficiary sought to prove for the debt of &#8356;34,471.18s.1d. The liquidator rejected the proof on the basis that s 200(1)(g) of the Companies Act 1936 (NSW) applied. The effect of that provision was that on a winding up a debt owed by the company to a person in the person's capacity as a member of the company, such as by way of dividend, was, relevantly, deemed not to be a debt payable to that member (cf the postponement now provided for in s 563A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) referred to at [196] above). 202 The beneficiary submitted (1) that the sum owed to her was not by way of dividend, and (2) that she was not a member but an assignee from a member."

Case407,cited,Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187),"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does. It will then hold the benefit of the obligor's undertaking upon a constructive trust for the assignee, even if specific performance of the contract to assign between assignor and assignee could not have been obtained by the assignee previously. As Lord Millett summarises the position, ""[t]he trust ceases to be defeasible or contingent; the vendor becomes a fiduciary; and the purchaser has all the remedies of a beneficiary under an ordinary trust"", citing Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187) esp per Lord Cranworth at 683 4 (ER 1192), and see also Lake v Bayliss [1974] 2 All ER 1114."

As well, the applicants refer to the Commissioner's Public Ruling TR 98/1 at [19], in which the Commissioner has said that as a general rule, the receipts method is appropriate to determine income derived from investments, although there are exceptions, such as in the case of interest from a business of money lending carried on by the taxpayer. 100 St Lucia [1924] AC 508 concerned the question whether interest on unpaid purchase money, payable but not paid, was ""income arising or accruing"" to the creditor for the purposes of the Income Tax Ordinance 1910 of St Lucia. After selling its estates and business in St Lucia, the taxpayer company did not reside or carry on business there, but was owed part of the purchase price at interest. Twelve months' interest fell due on 30 November 1921 but was not paid. Whether the company was liable to pay income tax in respect of the year 1921 on that interest depended on whether that interest was ""income arising or accruing"" to the company derived from a source in the colony. 101 The Privy Council rejected the Colonial Treasurer's contention that the interest accrued to the company in 1921. Their Lordships stated (at 512 513): The words ""income arising or accruing"" are not equivalent to the words ""Debts arising or accruing"". To give them that meaning is to ignore the word ""income"". The words mean ""money arising or accruing by way of income"". There must be a coming in to satisfy the word ""income"". This is a sense which is assisted or confirmed by the word ""received"" in the proviso at the end of s 4, subs 1. If the taxpayer be the holder of stock of a foreign Government carrying say 5 per cent interest, and the Government is that of a defaulting State which does not pay the interest, the taxpayer has neither received nor has there accrued to him any income in respect of that stock. A debt has accrued to him but income has not. It does not follow that income is confined to that which the taxpayer actually receives. Where income tax is deducted at the source the taxpayer never receives the sum deducted but it accrues to him. It is said, and truly, that a commercial company, in preparing its balance sheet and profit and loss account, does not confine itself to its actual receipts does not prepare a mere cash account but values its book debts and its stock in trade and so on and calculates its profits accordingly. From the practice of commerce and of accountants and from the necessity of the case this is so. But this is far from establishing that income arises or accrues from ... an investment which fails to pay the interest due. I do not think it necessary to refer further to s 4(1)'s reference to ""received"" that is mentioned in this passage. 102 The sale that gave rise to the liability to pay the interest appears to have been a one off, indeed a final, sale of the company's estates in St Lucia. The facts are therefore far removed from those of the present case in which ABB Australia was one of 1,000 wholly owned subsidiaries of ABB Zurich, and the latter company, in its role as shareholder, declared the dividend and framed the terms of payment. On the other hand, the passage does distinguish between money falling due and payable (in the present case, the amount of the dividend had not fallen due and payable as at 30 May 1996) and money coming in."
Case412,cited,Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523,"With reference to the eighth proposition, I note that the idea that the legal chose in action is held on trust after the consideration is paid in full is well accepted in the case law; see for example, the Australian cases Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1 at 26 27 and McIntyre v Gye (1994) 51 FCR 472 at 480 481, and the cases referred to in Meagher RP, Heydon JD and Leeming MJ, Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6-050]. The operative principle is that equity regards as done that which ought to be done, the assignor's conscience being bound to that end: Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999); Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523. There is, however, criticism of descriptions of the purchaser's equitable interest between contract and payment of the purchase money as that of a beneficiary under a trust; see for example Heydon JD and Loughlan PL, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (6 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6.7], [6.16] [6.18]. Dr Tolhurst goes further and suggests (op cit, [4.07]) an ""assignment analysis"" according to which, even in the former class of case (where the consideration for the assignment has been paid), a trust of the legal chose is unnecessary except as a remedial device granted by the court. In such a case, however, the case law is all one way in favour of a constructive trust arising as a matter of substantive law. In any event, his Lordship's evidence to that effect was not challenged."
Case413,cited,Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369,"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does. It will then hold the benefit of the obligor's undertaking upon a constructive trust for the assignee, even if specific performance of the contract to assign between assignor and assignee could not have been obtained by the assignee previously. As Lord Millett summarises the position, ""[t]he trust ceases to be defeasible or contingent; the vendor becomes a fiduciary; and the purchaser has all the remedies of a beneficiary under an ordinary trust"", citing Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187) esp per Lord Cranworth at 683 4 (ER 1192), and see also Lake v Bayliss [1974] 2 All ER 1114."

It then said (at [4]): 'The issue in contention was whether special circumstances existed that would make it appropriate to treat the compensation payment either in whole or part as not having been made.' 15 The Tribunal reviewed Mr Homewood's evidence. It dealt with that evidence largely by setting out his responses to various documentary exhibits put to him. The exhibits were not always identified with clarity. 38 The present case is not about a failure on the part of the Tribunal to include in its reasons the findings on material questions of fact which it has made. Nor is it a complaint that the Tribunal has failed to refer to the evidence on which those findings were based.

Case421,cited,Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 76 ALR 313,"The Tribunal's obligation is to give its reasons for its decision in the sense explained earlier. In so doing it is not required to express itself with the precision that might be required of a court of law. As Morling and Wilcox JJ said in Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 76 ALR 313 (at 328): 'The tribunal is an administrative body and, whilst errors of law made by it are susceptible to correction by this court, its decisions should not be too closely scrutinised for the purpose of searching for errors of law in what may be imprecise language.' In my opinion, the Tribunal made a finding of fact that within six months Mr Homewood would be destitute (absent the disability support pension). It had regard to his asset position in coming to that conclusion. The complaint that it has not adequately disclosed its reasons for so concluding amounts to little more than a complaint about its findings of fact. 46 The Secretary accepted, by reference to [44] of the Tribunal's reasons, that the amount available for Mr Homewood's support could arguably be fixed at a lower range of between $20,000 and $30,000. That is not a reading of the Tribunal's reasons which is particularly generous to Mr Homewood. It is to be noted that the assets giving rise to those figures are comprised of 'coin collections and other collectibles', '20 boxes of items' 'DVDs ...; a motor vehicle worth less than $5,000'. 47 Having regard to the nature of the assets to which the Tribunal adverted in its reasons, its finding that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months was open to it. That finding formed a base, in principle, for the exercise of the discretion under s 1184K(1) of the Act. The way in which it approached the exercise of that discretion was adequately explained by reference to its finding of fact. While it may be argued that a more elaborate and principled approach by reference to the rules governing the fixing of preclusion periods under the Act would have been preferable, that is not the basis upon which the Tribunal's decision is attacked in this case. It is attacked only on the basis that it has failed to give adequate reasons. In my opinion that challenge is not made out and the application should be dismissed. 48 For the preceding reasons the application is dismissed.

Case422,discussed,Biscayne Partners Pty Ltd v Valance Corp Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 874,"The reasons why a failure to complain may have relevance or may assist in resolution of an issue were stated by Einstein J in Biscayne Partners Pty Ltd v Valance Corp Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 874 at [150] . What underlies his Honour's explanation is that a failure to complain may point to a finding of absence of any real ground for complaint or reliance where a plaintiff would be expected to have spoken. But the principle assumes that the person had knowledge of the alleged misrepresentation at the relevant time. That is to say, how can a failure to complain about that which the party was unaware have any real probative value? 13 Whether the failure to complain goes to credit or to an issue in the proceeding will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. In the present proceedings it may be that the proposed cross-examination goes in some way to the issue of reliance as shown in the authorities relied upon by the respondents. However, in light of the material which the respondents wish to explore as set out in the draft list of proposed topics of cross-examination, I am inclined to the view that the cross-examination will go in some significant respects to Mr Seward's credit. 14 To the extent that the proposed cross-examination will go to credit I am not satisfied that it would have substantial probative value. Moreover, I am not persuaded that a sufficient evidentiary basis has been established on the present motion to warrant reopening cross-examination. In particular, it appears from evidence adduced in the proceedings that in the period from 2001-2002 BWC was suffering increasing financial difficulties but it is not established on this motion that Mr Seward was at that time aware, as the applicants contend, that Quadrant had allowed Mr Blom to present projections to the applicants without revealing that Blom's earlier (and less optimistic) projections had failed. 15 Insofar as the respondents call in aid the ""most walks of life"" ordinary human nature test referred to by Einstein J in Biscayne , the material referred to in the respondents' affidavits on the motion seems to me to be insufficient to justify the exercise of my discretion. I do not consider that the topics listed in the draft list illustrate with a sufficient degree of confidence that the evidence would have sufficient evidentiary value to justify me in exercising my discretion in this matter."

The validity of reg 4(1) of the Transitional Provisions Regulations was upheld by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 228 CLR 566 at [23] [28]. 30 The Transitional Provisions Regulations were made pursuant to s 40 and s 42 of the 1992 Reform Act (see the discussion in Nystrom at [26]). Relevantly, s 40(5) and s 40(6), provided: (5) The regulations may provide that, from 1 September 1994, visas or permits in a specified Principal Act class and held by specified persons immediately before that date are to continue in effect as visas in a specified amended Act class. (6) The regulations may provide that, from 1 September 1994, specified persons are to be taken to have been granted visas in a specified amended Act class. Paragraph 42 of the explanatory memorandum to the 1992 Reform Bill provides an explanation as to the anticipated effect of s 40(5) and s 40(6): The clause [i.e. the relevant clause of the Migration Reform Bill 1992 which introduced proposed s 40(5) and s 40(6)] also provides that regulations may continue in force visas or entry permits of specified classes which were held immediately before the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas. Related to this provision, the regulations may also deem specified persons to be taken to have been granted visas in a specified class created after the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas. 31 The import of s 40(5) and s 40(6) appears to be that the regulations made pursuant to those provisions may differentiate between visas or permits that are deemed to ""continue in effect"" as at 1 September 1994, and visas that have been deemed to have been ""granted"" to a person as at 1 September 1994. Indeed, and in contradistinction to reg 4.01, reg 9 of the Transitional Provisions Regulations provides that the holders of particular types of visas are deemed to have been granted a transitional (permanent) visa on 1 September 1994. As reg 9 states: A non-citizen who, immediately before 1 September 1994, held an old visa of the kind known as: (a) an Authority to Return; or (b) a Return Endorsement; is taken, on 1 September 1994, to have been granted a transitional (permanent) visa permitting the holder: (c) to travel to and enter Australia within 3 years after each departure from Australia; and (d) to remain indefinitely in Australia. 32 An important element in the applicant's case was that the Minister's power to cancel under the then s 180A (now s 501) of the Principal Act was restricted to visas and entry permits that had been ""granted"" to persons (and not acquired by operation of law) and this manifested a deliberate choice. This proposition is said to be apparent from the temporal proximity between the enactment of the Offences and Undesirable Persons Act and the enactment of the 1992 Reform Act, which as noted earlier, created a distinction between visas that are taken to have been granted and visas that are deemed to continue in effect."

That is, because permission to remain in Australia granted before the Migration Reform Act continues in force as a visa, it may be cancelled as a visa.

Case435,cited,Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236,"Support for the applicant's contention can be found in the decision in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236 at 246, where a Full Court observed that the power conferred on the Minister to cancel a visa under s 501 only applies to visas that have been granted to a person. Where a visa has been granted to a person, s 501F(3) operates so that any other visa held by that person is cancelled. On this basis, where an absorbed person visa is cancelled, a transitional (permanent) visa held by that person is also cancelled. However, the Full Court indicated that this process could not operate in reverse. It will be necessary to say something more about this judgment later in these reasons. 13 The applicant also submitted that he had not ""ceased to be an immigrant"" prior to 2 April 1984, and hence has never held an absorbed person visa as contemplated by s 34 of the Principal Act. If so, it was submitted, the applicant is not the holder of an absorbed person visa and is the holder of only one visa, a transitional (permanent) visa, which cannot be cancelled. 14 The Minister submitted that there is no basis for treating the word ""granted"" in s 501(2) as limiting the cancellation power in the way submitted by the applicant. ""Granted"", in the context of s 501(2), encompasses any means by which a person is given or acquires a visa. The word ""granted"", as it appears in s 501(2), should be read as encompassing any means of giving under the law, including giving by statute as well as giving by administrative decision. Indeed, the purpose of the language in question (""granted to a person""), it was submitted, is to distinguish s 501(2), which concerns the cancellation of visas that are already in effect, from s 501(1), which concerns a refusal to grant visas on character grounds. For the purposes of s 501(2), what is significant is that the person has a visa and not the means by which that visa was acquired. 34 It is necessary to say something more about the Full Court judgment in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The observations of the Full Court in [42]-[45] of their reasons entail a fairly unequivocal statement that a power to cancel a visa ""that has been granted"" would not be exercisable in relation to a transitional (permanent) visa because that type of visa had not been ""granted"" or could not be taken to have been granted. However these observations do not, in my opinion, form part of the ratio of the decision. The observations were made in a passage in which the Full Court was discussing ground one in the appeal. At [39], the Full Court indicated that two questions arose in the consideration of ground one. The first was whether the appellant could be taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa (which depended on whether he had been absorbed into the Australian community). The second was if he had not obtained an absorbed person visa, had the Minister effectively cancelled his transitional (permanent) visa. At [60] the Full Court concluded that the appellant had been absorbed into the Australian community well before to April 1984. The Full Court then concluded that the appellant held an absorbed person visa which was taken to have been granted to him. In the result, it was a visa which had been ""granted"" and one the Minister was empowered to cancel. It does not appear to me that this chain of reasoning necessarily depended on a conclusion that the Minister had no power to cancel a visa which had not been granted. 35 Nonetheless, even though these observations do not form part of the ratio of the decision in Moore , it is necessary for me, as a single judge, to give them significant weight. However, I am firmly convinced that the power to cancel conferred by s 501 was intended to be exercisable in relation to a transitional (permanent) visa. In this case, the applicant held such a visa because he had been originally granted an entry permit. When s 180A was enacted in 1992, the applicant held an entry permit that had been granted. That permit could have been cancelled by exercise of the power conferred by s 180A. The removal of the reference to a power to cancel ""a valid entry permit that had been granted"" occurred at a time when, by the combined effect of legislative amendments and the promulgation of regulations, visas became the sole means of conferring a right to remain lawfully in Australia. 36 It is inconceivable, in my view, that the amendments made in 1994 to s 180A were intended to render immune from the power to cancel, an entry permit which had been transmogrified into a transitional (permanent) visa. The power conferred by what was then the renumbered s 501 was plainly intended to authorise the Minister to cancel whatever visa was held by a person who the Minister thought ought no longer be able to remain in Australia having regard to that person's character. Obviously I am not concerned here with the appropriateness of the underlying policy or the way in which the power has been exercised in this or any other case. However, I have no doubt the power is intended to be exercisable in relation to any visa and the words ""that has been granted"" were not intended to condition or limit the power. These words remained as the truncated residue of the formulation first appearing in s 180A, namely ""a valid visa or a valid entry permit that has been granted"". 37 In my opinion, the Minister had power to cancel the applicant's transitional (permanent) visa. I order that the period within which the applicant is to file his application be extended, and the application be dismissed with costs. I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.

Case436,referred to,Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper [1981] HCA 1 ; (1981) 148 CLR 337,"In Ascot Investments Pty Ltd v Harper [1981] HCA 1 ; (1981) 148 CLR 337 Gibbs CJ said (at 354): 'The general words of ss. 80 and 114 must be understood in the context of the Act, which confers jurisdiction on the Family Court in matrimonial causes and associated matters, and in that context it would be unreasonable to impute to the Parliament an intention to give power to the Family Court to extinguish the rights, and enlarge the obligations, of third parties, in the absence of clear and unambiguous words. It can safely be assumed that the Parliament intended that the powers of the Family Court should be wide enough to prevent either of the parties to a marriage from evading his or her obligations to the other party, but it does not follow that the Parliament intended that the legitimate interests of third parties should be subordinated to the interests of a party to a marriage, or that the Family Court should be able to make orders that would operate to the detriment of third parties. There is nothing in the words of the sections that suggests that the Family Court is intended to have power to defeat or prejudice the rights, or nullify the powers, of third parties, or to require them to perform duties which they were not previously liable to perform. It is one thing to order a party to a marriage to do whatever is within his power to comply with an order of the court, even if what he does may have some effect on the position of third parties, but it is quite another to order third parties to do what they are not legally bound to do.'"
Case437,referred to,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Swain (1988) 20 FCR 507,"In The Queen v Ross-Jones; Ex parte Green [1984] HCA 82 ; (1984) 156 CLR 185, Wilson and Dawson JJ said (at 211) (footnotes omitted): 'We should add that even if those proceedings were a matrimonial cause, the Family Court would nevertheless lack the power to grant the relief sought. Apart from any constitutional limitation, it is now authoritatively established that as a matter of construction the general powers of the Family Court are to be understood in the context of the Family Law Act which confers jurisdiction upon the Court in matrimonial causes and associated matters. Those powers, which include the power to grant injunctive relief under s. 114 , are not to be construed so as to confer jurisdiction to defeat the rights, or enlarge the obligations, of persons who are not parties to the marriage involved in the relevant matrimonial cause: Ascot Investments Pty. Ltd. v. Harper .' The principle referred to in the above passages has been applied in a number of cases in this Court and, in particular, it was applied in a context involving the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Swain (1988) 20 FCR 507. Davies, Lockhart and Burchett JJ said (at 514): 'A sequestration order reflects a right of a creditor, and creates rights as between a debtor and his creditors and trustee. The Family Court, in the pursuit of its duty (in an appropriate case) to adjust rights as between the parties to a marriage, has no power to deprive other parties of their rights. Its power to deal with the property of the parties over whom it has jurisdiction must start with the property that is theirs, not with property that the law (whether the Bankruptcy Act or some other law) has vested in another.'"
Case438,referred to,Re Boscolo; Ex parte Botany Council (1996) 62 FCR 397,"Thirdly, (in terms of the position before the Amending Act) s 35A of the Bankruptcy Act has been in the Act since 1988 and the above principles did not mean that this Court would never exercise its discretion to transfer proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act to the Family Court. The circumstances of the case might suggest that that course was appropriate even though, once transferred, the Family Court was bound to give full force and effect to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act : Re Sabri; Ex parte Sabri v Brien (1995) 60 FCR 131. I also refer to Re Boscolo; Ex parte Botany Council (1996) 62 FCR 397 as an example of a case where this Court refused to transfer proceedings to the Family Court."
Case439,referred to,Re Sabri; Ex parte Sabri v Brien (1995) 60 FCR 131,"Thirdly, (in terms of the position before the Amending Act) s 35A of the Bankruptcy Act has been in the Act since 1988 and the above principles did not mean that this Court would never exercise its discretion to transfer proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act to the Family Court. The circumstances of the case might suggest that that course was appropriate even though, once transferred, the Family Court was bound to give full force and effect to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act : Re Sabri; Ex parte Sabri v Brien (1995) 60 FCR 131. I also refer to Re Boscolo; Ex parte Botany Council (1996) 62 FCR 397 as an example of a case where this Court refused to transfer proceedings to the Family Court. 26 Had this application been made under the law as it stood prior to the enactment of the Amending Act, I would have seen no reason to transfer the proceedings to the Family Court. It is true that the Family Court would have had jurisdiction to hear the trustee's claim by reason of the order for transfer and the provisions of s 35A, but the Family Court would have had no power to make orders altering the ownership interests in the freehold property, leasehold property and speedboat if and once the trustee had brought the transfers within the provisions of s 120 or s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act . If he was unsuccessful in doing that then the ownership interests would remain as they are. Furthermore, there is no existing order of the Family Court that might suggest, as it did in Re Sabri; Ex parte Sabri v Brien , that to avoid the appearance of conflict between orders, the proceedings should be transferred to the Family Court. 27 For the purposes of this case, the important change introduced by the Amending Act is that it gives the Family Court the power to make such orders as it considers appropriate, altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in what is referred to as 'the vested bankruptcy property'. It is necessary to examine the amendments in some detail because, as the submissions developed, counsel for Mrs Edge submitted that in pursuing a matrimonial cause the trustee 'had simply issued in the wrong court'. 28 The starting point is the introduction into the Family Law Act of two new paragraphs in the definition of 'matrimonial cause'. For present purposes, paragraph (cb) is the relevant paragraph and it is in the following terms: '(cb) proceedings between: (i) a party to a marriage; (ii) the bankruptcy trustee of a bankrupt party to the marriage; with respect to any vested bankruptcy property in relation to the bankrupt party, being proceedings: (iii) arising out of the marital relationship; or (iv) in relation to concurrent, pending or completed divorce or validity of marriage proceedings between the parties to the marriage; or (v) in relation to the divorce of the parties to the marriage, the annulment of the marriage or the legal separation of the parties to the marriage, being a divorce, annulment or legal separation effected in accordance with the law of an overseas jurisdiction, where that divorce, annulment or legal separation is recognised as valid in Australia under section 104 ;' 29 The term 'vested bankruptcy property' is defined in s 4 of the Family Law Act as follows: '""vested bankruptcy property"" , in relation to a bankrupt, means property of the bankrupt that has vested in the bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 . For this purpose, property has the same meaning as in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 .' 30 By reason of the Amending Act, s 79(1) of the Family Law Act (which is in Part VIII) now reads: '(1) In property settlement proceedings, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate: (a) in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them--altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property; or (b) in the case of proceedings with respect to the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage--altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in the vested bankruptcy property; including: (c) an order for a settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property; and (d) an order requiring: (i) either or both of the parties to the marriage; or (ii) the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any); to make, for the benefit of either or both of the parties to the marriage or a child of the marriage, such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines.'"
Case440,referred to,The Queen v Ross-Jones; Ex parte Green [1984] HCA 82 ; (1984) 156 CLR 185,"On 18 May 2006, Mrs Edge issued proceedings in the Family Court of Australia against the trustee and the bankrupt seeking certain orders under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) ('the Family Law Act '). During the course of the submissions on the application, counsel for Mrs Edge indicated that the orders sought in the proceedings in the Family Court may need to be amended. After the submissions, a member of the firm of solicitors acting for Mrs Edge filed an affidavit in which it is said that Mrs Edge has amended the application in the proceedings in the Family Court in terms of the orders sought. Subject to the question of costs, I am prepared to decide this application on the basis of the orders sought in the amended application. Those orders are as follows: '1. That pursuant to section 44(3) of the Family Law Act 1975 , leave of the Court be granted to institute proceedings for the orders applied for hereinafter. 2. That pursuant to section 78 of the Family Law Act 1975 a declaration be made that: 2.1 Pursuant to section 90KA of the Family Law Act 1975 , the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 is valid and binding, and 2.2 The transfers executed on 18 and 19 September 2002 respectively pursuant to the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 are valid and binding. 2.3 In the alternative to 2.2, that the transfers effected on 18 and 19 September 2002 respectively were in contemplation of the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 and thus valid and binding. 2.4 As a consequence thereof the wife is entitled to be and remain registered as the sole proprietor both at law and in equity of the properties situate at and known as 68 Range Road North, Upper Hermitage in the State of South Australia being all the land comprised in Certificate of Title Volume 5711 Folio 494 and 32 &amp; 33 Pelican Point, Morgan in the State of South Australia being all the land comprised in Certificate of Title Volume 5203 folio 799. 3. In the alternative, that if the Transfers referred to in paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 above are void against the first respondent by reason of the operation of either or both of sections 120 and 121 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 : - 3.1 An order pursuant to sub-sections 90K(1)(b) and (c) of the Family Law Act terminating the binding financial agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003. 3.2 Such order as is just and equitable pursuant to section 90K(3) of the Family Law Act 1975 preserving or adjusting the rights of the wife in relation to the property the subject of the terminated binding financial agreement. 4 In the further alternative to 2 and 3, that pursuant to section 79 of the Family Law Act 1975 , the net matrimonial assets of the parties be divided as to 75% to the applicant wife and 25% to the respondent husband. 5 That the husband's Trustee in Bankruptcy PETER IVAN MACKS be substituted as the Respondent in these proceedings in respect of the husband's property that may vest in the Trustee in Bankruptcy.' 15 The trustee submits that, insofar as an order is sought under s 79(1) of the Family Law Act , the application is out of time, and it will be necessary for Mrs Edge to obtain an extension of time. I have no information before me as to whether an extension of time will be granted, and I think it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that it may be granted. 16 Significant amendments were made to the Bankruptcy Act and Family Law Act by the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (Cth). I will refer to this Act as 'the Amending Act'. In terms of the issues in this case, it was not suggested that the relevant provisions of the Amending Act did not apply by reason of the fact that the relevant provisions came into effect during the course of 2005. I note that the amendments in Schedule 1 came into operation on 18 September 2005, those in Schedule 2 on 18 March 2005 and the balance on 15 April 2005. 17 In order to explain the effect of the Amending Act on the legal rights and interests between a non-bankrupt spouse and the trustee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt spouse, it is necessary to briefly examine the position before that Act. For present purposes, the previous position may be summarised as follows. 18 First, s 120(2) excludes from the operation of subsection (1) (among other things) a transfer to meet all or part of a liability under a maintenance agreement. Before 15 April 2005, 'maintenance agreement' was defined to include a financial agreement within the meaning of the Family Law Act . A similar exclusion or exception applied in relation to other provisions in the Bankruptcy Act , but it was not an exclusion or exception in the case of the operation of s 121 where the main purpose of the transfer was to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferor's creditors or to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division among the transferor's creditors (s 123(6)). Before the introduction of the Amending Act, Mrs Edge could have raised as a defence or exception to the trustee's claim under s 120, but not s 121, an allegation that the transfers were to meet liabilities under a financial agreement. 23 In The Queen v Ross-Jones; Ex parte Green [1984] HCA 82 ; (1984) 156 CLR 185, Wilson and Dawson JJ said (at 211) (footnotes omitted): 'We should add that even if those proceedings were a matrimonial cause, the Family Court would nevertheless lack the power to grant the relief sought. Apart from any constitutional limitation, it is now authoritatively established that as a matter of construction the general powers of the Family Court are to be understood in the context of the Family Law Act which confers jurisdiction upon the Court in matrimonial causes and associated matters. Those powers, which include the power to grant injunctive relief under s. 114 , are not to be construed so as to confer jurisdiction to defeat the rights, or enlarge the obligations, of persons who are not parties to the marriage involved in the relevant matrimonial cause: Ascot Investments Pty. Ltd. v. Harper .' The principle referred to in the above passages has been applied in a number of cases in this Court and, in particular, it was applied in a context involving the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Swain (1988) 20 FCR 507. Davies, Lockhart and Burchett JJ said (at 514): 'A sequestration order reflects a right of a creditor, and creates rights as between a debtor and his creditors and trustee. The Family Court, in the pursuit of its duty (in an appropriate case) to adjust rights as between the parties to a marriage, has no power to deprive other parties of their rights.

Case441,followed,Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZKKC (2007) 159 FCR 565,"However, the decision of Scarlett FM was handed down before the decision of a Full Federal Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZKKC (2007) 159 FCR 565. That case is authority for the proposition that s 477 of the Act requires actual notification of the written statement required by s 430(1). Buchanan J, with whom Gyles J and I agreed, said at [37] that the sole method of actual notification is physical delivery by hand. 5 His Honour also said at [47] that: ""Before their [i.e. the applicants'] right to apply for judicial review of a decision of the RRT which is alleged to be beyond jurisdiction is extinguished it will be necessary for the periods of time prescribed by s 477 to pass after an applicant is given personally the written statement required by s 430(1) of the Act..."" 6 Justice Gyles, at [1] and [4], pointed to the serious practical difficulties which flow from the reasons of the Full Court. 7 The decision in SZKKC is now the subject of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. However, plainly enough, I am bound by the decision of the Full Court unless and until it is overturned by the High Court. 8 The Minister, in his written submissions, pointed to a number of discretionary considerations as to why I ought not to grant leave to appeal. Mr Chami also pointed to the fact that ordinarily presumptions would be raised against the applicant on the question of receipt of the reasons of the Tribunal. However, it seems to me that none of the matters to which reference is made in the Minister's submissions go to the question which was before Scarlett FM as to whether the Federal Magistrates Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application for judicial review. 9 In light of the decision of the Full Court in SZKKC there can be no real argument but that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave to appeal. There would, of course, be an injustice to the applicant if leave were denied because he would be shut out from a substantive hearing of his application for review. 10 It follows that I propose to grant leave to appeal against the decision of Scarlett FM. Moreover, it seems to me that the practical course is to allow the appeal because the matter cannot be distinguished from the decision of the Full Court in SZKKC . 11 After some debate, Mr Chami accepted the inevitability of this outcome and did not really oppose an order that the appeal be allowed because the effect of this will be that the matter is to be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for hearing of the application for review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 12 In his reasons for judgment Scarlett FM drew attention to the delays in this matter. He expressed the view that the delays on the part of the Minister's Department are ""nothing short of astonishing"". Whether or not this is so, it does seem to me that this is a case which calls out for an urgent hearing. I would therefore make the following orders: (1) Leave to appeal against the decision of Scarlett FM of 18 June 2007 be granted. (2) The appeal be heard instanter. (3) The appeal be allowed, to the intent that the decision of Scarlett FM that the application be dismissed as incompetent is to be set aside. (4) The order made by Scarlett FM on 18 June 2007 be set aside. (5) The application in this matter be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for hearing."

Case445,followed,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626,"The ""public interest"" claimed by the ACCC to require protection of Category III documents from disclosure was said to be to encourage, by ensuring the confidentiality of information they provide, cartel whistleblowers to come forward. In ACCC v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626 at [43] , the Court suggested in obiter dicta that such a public interest might exist. In the present case, Counsel for the ACCC put it this way: The public interest ... is to induce the Amcors of this world - those who come forward early, under the immunity policy - to give the fullest possible assistance to the [ACCC] to ensure that the cartel is put at an end as quickly as possible, prosecuted, and brought to finality quickly. The more assistance that Amcor gives the [ACCC] in that regard, the better the quality of the admissions and the evidence ... 28 Counsel for the ACCC conceded that confidentiality could not be absolute, in that both the ACCC and any potential whistleblower should reasonably expect that the whistleblower might have to testify in open court (ie, the whistleblower's statements might ultimately come into the public domain). Nevertheless, counsel for the ACCC maintained that this expectation was not inconsistent with a reasonable expectation that statements provided to the ACCC will remain confidential because most cartel cases settle with the result that: (1) it never becomes necessary for witness statements of whistleblowers to be used in court; and (2) the entry into the public domain of witness statements of whistleblowers is the exception rather than the rule. Without being able to rely on the confidentiality of statements not used in court, counsel for the ACCC submitted that whistleblowers might be dissuaded from coming forward and the public interest in rooting out cartel conduct correspondingly injured. 29 Regardless of whatever theoretical merit the argument may have (which I will address shortly), the force of the ACCC's submission was undercut by the evidence of its own witness Mr Cassidy (the officer in charge of the leniency program for cartel whistleblowers) that in the present case Amcor did not seek confidentiality guarantees in its immunity application. In ACCC v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626 at [44] , the Court suggested that the force of any public interest immunity claim will be vitiated where the independent witnesses cooperating with the ACCC did not even seek confidentiality. I agree. Moreover, even the broader factual merit of the claim is suspect, as the ACCC led no evidence that any cartel whistleblower, whether in this case or otherwise, has demonstrated reluctance to come forward based on a concern that information provided might become public. 30 The theoretical merit of the ACCC's confidentiality contentions is even more deficient. A cartel claim, by definition, involves collusion between two or more actors. In the same way that it is both inevitable and self-evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against (ie, disclosed to) the non-cooperating conspirators, it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows, or should know, that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties. As such, the ACCC's claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance. And without such a reasonable expectation, the ACCC's contention that non-disclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand."

Amcor and Visy have discovered the documents in the damages proceedings, but the ACCC seeks to prevent them from producing those documents to Cadbury on discovery. 3 Specifically, the ACCC contends that legal professional privilege held by it prevents Amcor and Visy's production to Cadbury of the following three categories of documents: (1) Six witness statements - of which three were drafted by Amcor's external solicitors at the direction of the ACCC and three were drafted by ACCC staff and then forwarded to Amcor's in-house counsel.

Case455,applied,Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501,"With respect to advice privilege it was, until recently, uncontroversial that the proponent had to establish three elements: (1) a confidential communication, (2) between a lawyer and client, (3) made for the dominant purpose of giving or receiving legal advice: see Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501, 508-09 (stating that a confidential lawyer-client relationship is required) and Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at [61] (adopting the dominant purpose test). The Full Court of the Federal Court has now dispensed with the second requirement, holding that third-party communications may come within the ambit of advice privilege: Pratt Holdings [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at [49] , and [105]. 9 However, the witnesses whose statements are at issue here had no express agreement or arrangement relating to confidentiality at the time the statements were made. Indeed, the ACCC's own witness in the present application confirmed that Amcor made no attempt to seek confidentiality: see [28] below. And it was not suggested that any implied agreement relating to confidentiality of communications between any of the witnesses and the investigators can be identified. It follows that advice privilege cannot attach to communications between the witnesses and investigators. And it also follows that no advice privilege inherently attaches to any documents (ie, the witness statements) summarizing those communications (which is not to say that privilege could never attach to copies or summaries of the communications depending on the purpose for which the copies or summaries were created: see Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501). Accordingly, a claim of advice privilege fails with respect to all three categories of disputed documents. 11 It is at this point that the doctrinal relationship between the advice and litigation branches of the privilege becomes relevant. As McLure JA noted in Leighton , the "" High Court has made numerous general statements which, on their face, are capable of applying to all categories of legal professional privilege, to the effect that the privilege only attaches to confidential communications "": Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [22] . In fact, some of those general statements can be fairly read to support the view that confidentiality is required for all categories of legal professional privilege. For example, in remarks quoted by Brennan CJ in Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 (at 508-09), Mason J stated in O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria [1982] HCA 74 ; (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 22-23: But if communications in written form are to be privileged they must still be confidential communications between solicitor and client made for the purpose of advice or for the purpose of use in existing or anticipated litigation. Be that as it may, I agree with McLure JA that the High Court has never squarely confronted the issue, leaving the field open for lower courts to take opposing views. 33 Second, the ""free rider"" argument fails because it is, ultimately, founded on a theory of ""work product"" privilege not accepted in Australia. The work product doctrine, recognized by the United States Supreme Court, states that information or material prepared by attorneys reflecting attorney mental impressions, strategy, or other ""work product,"" even though not documenting lawyer-client communications or otherwise within the ambit of ordinary legal professional privilege, may be independently protected from discovery: Hickman v Taylor (1947) 329 US 495. The problem for the ACCC, however, is that work product is not recognized in Australia as an independent head of privilege: Commissioner of Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 570 (describing the US work product doctrine as part of general privilege law in Australia) (Gummow J); Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [17] (stating in Australia that the work product doctrine is recognised in the context of the litigation privilege). The ACCC itself has acknowledged this state of affairs: ACCC Position Paper, ""Review of Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct"" (26 August 2005) at 19 n 21, available at http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=725616&amp;nodeId=3a1faa8ec1e755f25adef02560676bf5&amp;fn=Leniency%20position%20paper.pdf (viewed 1 February 2008). 37 For the sake of completeness, I should first note Cadbury's overall argument regarding the Category I documents. It was based on the fact that the copy witness statements retained by Amcor were just that - copies - and thus under Propend , their privilege status may differ from that of the original. To the extent that I have correctly understood the argument put by counsel, it misunderstands Propend . Propend established that the copy of a document may under some circumstances (ie depending on the dominant purpose for which it was created) be privileged even though the original is not privileged: Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 508 per Brennan CJ, 543-544 per Gaudron J, and 554 per McHugh J. I do not, however, consider that Propend also establishes the converse; that is, the copy of a document may be unprivileged even though the original is. 38 Instead, I understand Propend to say that a copy of a privileged document will also be privileged unless the privilege has been expressly or impliedly waived (although it may be that allowing a copy to be made in certain circumstances is capable of being conduct constituting such a waiver, such as when a copy is made and communicated to a third party for purposes not related to legal advice or litigation): cf Spotless Group Ltd v Premier Building Pty Ltd [2006] VSCA 201 at [60] - [66] (noting that Propend left the issue open but concluding that whether a copy of a privileged document is privileged is distinct from whether privilege has been waived). As such, Cadbury's argument, notwithstanding the way in which counsel sought to frame it, may be reduced to two questions: (1) are the documents privileged; and (2) has privilege been waived? 43 Against that background, I now turn to the question of waiver. Cadbury correctly notes that there is no evidence as to how or why copies of Category I documents were made and retained by Amcor or Amcor's external solicitors. As noted earlier, Cadbury agitated this argument as a reverse Propend claim. It is, however, more properly understood as a waiver claim. That is to say, Cadbury appears to argue that although the original documents may have been created by or provided to Amcor under circumstances of confidentiality and even express claims of privilege, allowing Amcor to make or retain copies for its own use is conduct by ACCC inconsistent with its privilege claim."

The Full Court's criticism of the Smoothdale line of cases (at [25]) was in the following terms: The difficulty with the approach in Smoothdale is highlighted by the approach of Barrett J in Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Marlin International Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 958 in which his Honour distinguished cases such as Smoothdale on the basis that they were concerned with use in one proceedings of a statement or an affidavit filed and served in another. Barrett J, on the other hand, was dealing with the question whether a party could tender, as an admission, parts of an affidavit sworn by the opposing party in the same proceeding. Barrett J said, buttressed by ample authority, that this could be done, because it was within the range of permitted use the purpose of the proceedings. Barrett J was undoubtedly correct. Thus, it is necessary to posit a limited waiver, within a broad framework of the conduct of proceedings, which may bring about the result (as in Austress ) that it is in the other side's power to destroy the privilege entirely by putting the statement or affidavit into evidence or examining or cross-examining on its contents.

Case458,applied,Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49,"With respect to advice privilege it was, until recently, uncontroversial that the proponent had to establish three elements: (1) a confidential communication, (2) between a lawyer and client, (3) made for the dominant purpose of giving or receiving legal advice: see Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501, 508-09 (stating that a confidential lawyer-client relationship is required) and Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at [61] (adopting the dominant purpose test). The Full Court of the Federal Court has now dispensed with the second requirement, holding that third-party communications may come within the ambit of advice privilege: Pratt Holdings [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at [49] , and [105]."
Case459,discussed,Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman [1995] HCA 19 ; (1995) 183 CLR 10,"A basic principle of Australian litigation is that parties give an implied undertaking to the court not to use any document produced to them in the course of litigation except in the context of that litigation: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman [1995] HCA 19 ; (1995) 183 CLR 10, 32, 36-37, 46; see also Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] 1 AC 280. Where other courts have erred doctrinally is in failing to distinguish the implied undertaking analysis from the waiver analysis. The Full Court in Liberty Funding recognized this error when it stated (at [26]): "" This so-called 'limited waiver' by service such that the privilege is waived only for the purpose of the legal proceedings in question might be seen to be no more than the operation of the implied undertaking dealt with in Harman "": Liberty Funding (2005) 218 ALR 283. In other words, the limitation on Visy's use of the witness proofs stems not from limitations to be inferred from the conduct of the ACCC in serving them, but in Visy's own obligations to the Court. 22 Depending on whether the restrictions on Visy's use of the witness proofs is sourced doctrinally to the legal professional privilege of the ACCC or, instead, the implied undertaking, is vital. It is vital because the implied undertaking is not absolute but the privilege is. The Plowman Court in dicta stated (at 33): No doubt the implied obligation must yield to inconsistent statutory provisions and to the requirements of curial process in other litigation, eg, discovery and inspection, but that circumstance is not a reason for denying the existence of the implied obligation. In Patrick v Capital Finance Pty Ltd (No4) [2003] FCA 436 at [15] - [22] , these dicta were applied in support of the proposition that a party is released from the implied undertaking when faced with a conflicting discovery obligation in a subsequent litigation."

So, for example, providing a witness statement to a party but subject to conditions that the party may use it only for internal purposes, may not read it in court, may not place it into evidence and may not otherwise rely on it in examination or the proceedings generally might constitute a limited waiver only: see Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83, 96 (stating that the waiver ""can be limited so that it applies only in relation to particular persons, materials or purposes"" ); Goldman v Hesper [1988] 3 All ER 97 (cited in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1988) 201 CLR 1 at [29] for the proposition that disclosure ""for a limited and specific purpose"" will not lead to loss of the privilege)."

The decision in Liberty Funding (2005) 218 ALR 283 was a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court. The reasoning, if I may say so, is both persuasive and sensible. If it is conceded, as it must be, that a party upon whom a witness statement is served may use that statement in any way within the context of those proceedings (that is the whole reason why it is filed and served), it follows that it is conduct ""inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect "" ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [29] ) and an implied waiver of privilege has occurred. Indeed, if one follows the Full Court's reasoning to its logical conclusion, the filing and service operates as a complete, not simply limited, waiver of legal privilege. 21 A basic principle of Australian litigation is that parties give an implied undertaking to the court not to use any document produced to them in the course of litigation except in the context of that litigation: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman [1995] HCA 19 ; (1995) 183 CLR 10, 32, 36-37, 46; see also Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] 1 AC 280.

In other words, the limitation on Visy's use of the witness proofs stems not from limitations to be inferred from the conduct of the ACCC in serving them, but in Visy's own obligations to the Court. 23 Moreover, even if the implied undertaking does not automatically give way, a party may still be released from it in the court's discretion upon showing ""special circumstances"": Liberty Funding (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [31]. Although Cadbury anticipated the implied undertaking issue in its written submissions in these proceedings, the ACCC did not address the implied undertaking in its submissions, nor was the issue fully ventilated in oral submissions by any party . Accordingly, the parties in the damages proceeding and the ACCC will be invited, though not required, to make further written and oral submissions about whether Visy's implied undertaking in the ACCC proceedings prevents Visy producing the Category II and Category III documents and, if the implied undertaking is not overridden, whether Visy should be released from it. 24 I now turn to the ACCC's separate claim of public interest immunity with respect to 8 of the 111 witness proofs, the Category III documents."

(That the documents in question here were all prepared at a time when litigation was anticipated or on foot was common ground.) A lawyer-client relationship is not required: Pratt Holdings [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357. However, in contrast to the settled confidentiality requirement of the advice privilege, the authorities are divided as to whether litigation privilege may attach to communications (or documents summarizing communications) between a third-party, independent witness and a client even where they are not confidential: State of New South Wales v Jackson [2007] NSWCA 179 at [37] ( ""There is some controversy over the need for confidentiality in litigation privilege at common law, and the controversy is particularly material to privilege for communications between client and third party"" ); Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [21] - [30] (collecting and summarizing the conflicting authorities).

As McLure JA noted in Leighton , the "" High Court has made numerous general statements which, on their face, are capable of applying to all categories of legal professional privilege, to the effect that the privilege only attaches to confidential communications "": Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [22] . In fact, some of those general statements can be fairly read to support the view that confidentiality is required for all categories of legal professional privilege. For example, in remarks quoted by Brennan CJ in Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 (at 508-09), Mason J stated in O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria [1982] HCA 74 ; (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 22-23: But if communications in written form are to be privileged they must still be confidential communications between solicitor and client made for the purpose of advice or for the purpose of use in existing or anticipated litigation. Be that as it may, I agree with McLure JA that the High Court has never squarely confronted the issue, leaving the field open for lower courts to take opposing views. 31 That the speculation regarding witness reluctance is likely to be unfounded is further supported by the fact, acknowledged by counsel for the ACCC, that even if production of the Category III documents were barred, Cadbury would be free to undertake its own investigation. As noted by McLure JA in Leighton , "" Privilege in respect of [the disputed] communications would not prevent the respondent interviewing [third-party] witnesses and obtaining all relevant information from them concerning the issues in the litigation "": Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [31] . It is perhaps, therefore, unsurprising that counsel for the ACCC ultimately fell back on a ""free rider"" argument - that is, that Cadbury should not have the benefit of the ACCC's work precisely because it could easily do the work itself. This argument fails for two reasons. 33 Second, the ""free rider"" argument fails because it is, ultimately, founded on a theory of ""work product"" privilege not accepted in Australia. The work product doctrine, recognized by the United States Supreme Court, states that information or material prepared by attorneys reflecting attorney mental impressions, strategy, or other ""work product,"" even though not documenting lawyer-client communications or otherwise within the ambit of ordinary legal professional privilege, may be independently protected from discovery: Hickman v Taylor (1947) 329 US 495. The problem for the ACCC, however, is that work product is not recognized in Australia as an independent head of privilege: Commissioner of Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 570 (describing the US work product doctrine as part of general privilege law in Australia) (Gummow J); Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [17] (stating in Australia that the work product doctrine is recognised in the context of the litigation privilege). The ACCC itself has acknowledged this state of affairs: ACCC Position Paper, ""Review of Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct"" (26 August 2005) at 19 n 21, available at http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=725616&amp;nodeId=3a1faa8ec1e755f25adef02560676bf5&amp;fn=Leniency%20position%20paper.pdf (viewed 1 February 2008). 40 In Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1979) 36 FLR 244, 246, Lockhart J described the litigation privilege rule as follows: Communications passing between the party and a third person (who is not the agent of the solicitor to receive the communication from the party) if they are made with reference to litigation either anticipated or commenced, and at the request or suggestion of the party's solicitor; or, even without any such request or suggestion, they are made for the purpose of being put before the solicitor with the object of obtaining his advice or enabling him to prosecute or defend an action. See also ACCC v FFE Building Services [2003] ATPR 41-967 at [24]-[33]; Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [12] ; Pratt Holdings [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at [1] , [89] and [96]. 44 In this regard, Amcor's solicitor Mr Meadows testified that his firm, Allens Arthur Robinson, was "" permitted to advise Amcor [based on knowledge it obtained in witness interviews summarized in the documents now at issue] subject to any confidentiality constraints that had been agreed ."" He added that the firm's copies were not being retained "" for the ACCC ."" Thus the argument might go that while Amcor may have been (and may still be) under some equitable or quasi-contractual obligation of confidentiality (ie it may not be free to simply distribute the documents as it sees fit), that cannot override the obligations of compulsory court process in this case: see Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [28] (stating that contractual or equitable duties cannot prevail over compulsory court process). 45 To restate the question, it comes down to this: did the ACCC, in allowing Amcor via its solicitors to make and retain copies of the Category I documents, engage in conduct impliedly waiving its privilege? To answer the question, I return to the analysis employed earlier at [15]-[18]. In contrast to the Category II and III documents, with respect to which the ACCC ceded complete control over disclosure to Visy by filing and serving the documents, the evidence with respect to Category I was that the use to which Amcor's solicitors could put the documents was limited to one purpose and one purpose only: advising the client. Indeed, as noted earlier, the three documents drafted by Amcor's solicitors could not even be shown to Amcor. The disclosure to Amcor was for a ""limited and specific purpose"" (advice to the client) and ""applies only in relation to particular persons and materials"" . Amcor employees were the particular persons. The materials were the communications and documents recording them. The ACCC's conduct in allowing copies of the documents to be made and retained constitutes only a limited waiver: see [18] above. It follows that the Category I documents are barred from production to Cadbury. 46 Strictly speaking, I need go no further. However, I think it appropriate before concluding to make a general observation about the ACCC's overall interest in this case and whether the courts are the appropriate forum for its resolution. The ACCC's submissions and the evidence from its witnesses demonstrated a concern that the increasing threat of private suits for damages brought by cartel victims will interfere with the ACCC's ability to obtain the cooperation from cartel participants necessary for it to bring and prosecute penalty actions. The interference was said to arise because potential cooperators will be deterred from coming forward, notwithstanding offers of leniency, by the prospect of having essentially given away the store in the inevitable damages actions. In other words, in considering whether to confess, the potential costs in damages may be seen by a cartel player to outweigh the potential savings in penalties. Distilling the point still further, one can see that the real concern of the ACCC - that is, the real deterrent to cooperation faced by the Amcors of the world - is damages exposure itself. In my view, the confidentiality and free-rider arguments ostensibly advanced here by the ACCC are, at best, a proxy for that concern, and at worst a smokescreen obscuring it. To be fair, the appropriate total level of private civil liability (ie, penalties plus damages) an actor should face for cartel conduct is a valid issue, and one which was long ago recognized by authorities and commentators in the United States in the context of cooperation and leniency: see eg, Giancarlo Spagnolo, ""Leniency and Whistleblowers in Antitrust,"" Centre for Economic Policy Research Discussion Paper Series No. 5794 (August 2006) at 15, available at http://www.cepr.org/pubs/dps/DP5794.asp (visited 11 February 2008). 47 But to acknowledge the ACCC's concern is not to approve of its proposed method for resolving that concern. On the contrary, the ACCC's attempt to use common law privilege doctrine to protect cooperators when they are faced with private suits for damages, albeit partially successful here, appears to me to be misguided. Whether cartel whistleblowers such as Amcor or those who cooperate with the regulators after the commencement of penalty proceedings (either by settling like Visy or in some other manner) should be rewarded or encouraged by reduced exposure or enhanced protection in damages proceedings is a broad question of policy that should be addressed by the legislature, not by ad hoc judicial tinkering through the backdoor of privilege. 48 The parties and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission may, if they wish, file and serve written submissions of not more than 10 pages as to: (1) whether Visy is still bound not to produce the Category II and Category III documents by its implied undertaking in the ACCC proceedings; and (2) if so, whether special circumstances exist such that the Court in its discretion ought to release Visy from that undertaking. The matter will be set down for further hearing, if necessary, at a date to be fixed in consultation with the parties. I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gordon.

Case483,cited,State of New South Wales v Jackson [2007] NSWCA 279,"With respect to litigation privilege, on the other hand, the analysis is not so simple.

A lawyer-client relationship is not required: Pratt Holdings [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357. However, in contrast to the settled confidentiality requirement of the advice privilege, the authorities are divided as to whether litigation privilege may attach to communications (or documents summarizing communications) between a third-party, independent witness and a client even where they are not confidential: State of New South Wales v Jackson [2007] NSWCA 179 at [37] ( ""There is some controversy over the need for confidentiality in litigation privilege at common law, and the controversy is particularly material to privilege for communications between client and third party"" ); Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [21] - [30] (collecting and summarizing the conflicting authorities).

Case487,cited,Telstra Corporation Ltd v AAPT Ltd [1997] 38 IPR 539,"The key principle assisting the Court in determining whether leave to appeal should be granted pursuant to s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act is whether the judgment was attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered and accordingly whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused: Telstra Corporation Ltd v AAPT Ltd [1997] 38 IPR 539 at 542. 11 In Court this afternoon the applicant clarified the first paragraph in his affidavit as being referable to the fact that the respondent had filed Ms Genz's affidavit after the date ordered by Jarrett FM on 13 March 2008, rather than the fact that the respondent had not actually filed a defence. In relation to this point I note in passing that there is no general requirement to file a defence in such matters before the Federal Magistrates Court. Part 4 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules allows the respondent to file a response (r 4.04) which must be filed and served within 14 days after the service of the application, and an affidavit must be filed with the response (r 4.05). I understand that the respondent filed a response and supporting affidavit on 24 December 2007. 12 In this case I am unable to see that the decision of the Federal Magistrate was attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered, or that substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused to the applicant. 13 First, in my view, paras 2, 3 and 4 deposed by the applicant in his affidavit of 30 May 2008 have little merit as grounds for leave to appeal. I make this observation because, dealing with each factor in turn: &#8226; the reference by the applicant to the respondent failing to comply with O 15 in para 2 is unclear; &#8226; what appear to be minimal irregularities to Ms Genz's affidavit in relation to the date it was sworn, while undesirable without proper attestation, nonetheless do not support an adjournment of the substantive hearing in these proceedings; and &#8226; I understand from the submissions of Mr Hooper for the respondent that the firm of lawyers earlier representing the respondent merged with another firm but that the resultant merged firm continued to act for the respondent. Part 9 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules deals with lawyers, and in particular r 9.02 which deals with change of lawyers. It is not clear to me how the applicant is affected, or has been affected, by the respondent changing its lawyer. The fact that a solicitor from the newly merged firm may have contacted him contrary to an arrangement that there be no telephone contact between the parties does not in my view form a reason of any substance for his Honour refusing to adjourn the substantive hearing. 14 Second, I am not persuaded that the applicant would suffer substantial injustice should leave to appeal be refused. The principal issue raised by the applicant, namely the fact that the respondent served an affidavit several days late and with a page missing, was addressed by his Honour during the hearing on 29 May 2008. Although the applicant indicated at that hearing that the lateness and incompleteness of the affidavit would prejudice him in preparation of his case for the hearing, including calling witnesses, I do not see how the applicant has suffered more than some inconvenience. The applicant has commenced these proceedings - it is his responsibility to prosecute his case. This includes organisation of evidence for the trial, and filing and serving affidavits of witnesses upon whose evidence the applicant wishes to rely at trial. I note that, according to the Federal Magistrates Court file, the only witness upon whose evidence the applicant is currently relying is himself and yet if the applicant wished to rely on the evidence of other witnesses it would have been incumbent on him to file and serve affidavits of those witnesses in accordance with the timetable ordered by the Federal Magistrate. Indeed, the applicant would be in breach of the orders of Jarrett FM were he to produce at trial witnesses whose evidence was not previously filed and served. While the applicant has a number of complaints about the lack of cooperation of the respondent and his resultant inability to contact potential witnesses to give evidence in support of his application, this is not in my view relevant to the application currently before me. 15 Further, the applicant claims that he has not been given sufficient time to prepare his case for trial. However these proceedings have been on foot since December 2007. The applicant today raised the need to care for his son as an issue which impacts upon his ability to prepare for trial. While I consider this to be a very real issue, there is no evidence before me that this has ever been raised before Jarrett FM as an issue relevant to the timing of the trial; nor does it relate in my view to the issue of lateness of service and incompleteness of Ms Genz's affidavit which forms the basis of the primary submissions of the applicant in this case. 16 The applicant has indicated that he is not ready for trial tomorrow. However the decision for me, in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal, is whether the judgment of Jarrett FM refusing to adjourn the hearing of the substantive proceedings is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration. In my view it is not. The appropriate order is that leave to appeal be refused, and I so order. I will also order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of today's proceedings, to be taxed if not otherwise agreed. I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

Case488,applied,Evans Deakin Proprietary Limited v Sebel Furniture Limited [2003] FCA 171,"helpful and reflective summary of principle in relation to the reception of expert evidence having regard to the Uniform Evidence Act (of which the Evidence Act is an exemplar), is to be found in the judgment of Allsop J, as his Honour then was, in Evans Deakin Proprietary Limited v Sebel Furniture Limited [2003] FCA 171 at [670] . His Honour there observed: Central to the orderly and admissible presentation of any expert evidence is the clear identification of the opinions that the expert seeks to present. This is a separate question from whether, for the opinions of the expert to be admissible, the basis of the opinions on the assumed facts must be set out, about which there may be different views expressed in Makita and Quick v Stoland . I think, however, any such difference is unlikely, in most cases, to be of significance in the light, in particular, of s 135 of the Evidence Act and its likely application to disembodied and unsubstantiated expressions of opinion, a matter to which reference was made in Quick v Stoland . If I may say so, without intending to put to one side the comprehensive reasons of Heydon JA in Makita or the careful reasons of the Judges in Quick v Stoland, in this case I particularly bear in mind what Gleeson CJ said in HG v The Queen at 727: ""The opinions of Mr McCombie were never expressed in admissible form."" And then his Honour emphasised this: An expert whose opinion is sought to be tendered should differentiate between the assumed facts upon which the opinion is based, and the opinion in question. Then a little later: Argument in this Court proceeded on the basis that it was possible to identify from Mr McCombie's written report some facts which he either observed or accepted, and which could be distinguished from his expressions of expert opinion. Then again Allsop J emphasised this in Gleeson CJ's reasons in HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2 at [39] : Even so, the provisions of section 79 will often have the practical effect of emphasising the need for attention to requirements of form. By directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience, the section requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question. This particular passage goes to the second basis upon which objection is taken to Mr Tait's opinion, which is that it is non-compliant with the requirements of the exception to the opinion rule, found in s 79 of the Evidence Act . Though initially, on the face of the report itself, I was apprehensive as to whether Mr Tait had exposed any particular expertise in relation to fish ecology and biology as applied to lungfish, I am satisfied, having regard to his supplementation of his experience in the affidavit filed this morning by leave, that he does have experience in relation to the ecology and management issues associated with the passage of freshwater fish, including lungfish, over barriers. The difficulty is that his report, as I have observed, ranges much more widely than the issues on the pleadings. Further, insofar as section 4 in particular of the report is concerned, that appears to be but a mere collation, as opposed to, overtly, the views of someone experienced with lungfish enlarging upon, by reference to his own specialised knowledge, the views of others which he regards as correct and appropriately included by way of highlighting particular qualities of the lungfish. There is also the vice elsewhere evident in the report, insofar as it may be relevant, of not making plain what is fact and what is opinion."
Case489,cited,Cassegrain v CTK Engineering [2008] NSWSC 457,"That process relevantly commenced with the making of an order for the payment of costs by the Supreme Court and the subsequent issue by a costs assessor of a certificate pursuant to s 368(1) of the Legal Profession Act . Section 372 of that Act provides for the finality of such determinations as follows: Determination to be final A costs assessor's determination of an application is binding on all parties to the application and no appeal or other assessment lies in respect of the determination, except as provided by this Division. Provision is made for the review of determinations made (ss 373 383) and for an appeal against a decision of a costs assessor "" as to a matter of law "" (s 384. See: O'Brien v Doherty [2008] NSWSC 205 ; Cassegrain v CTK Engineering [2008] NSWSC 457)."
Case490,considered,Chesson v Smith (1992) 35 FCR 594,"Some decisions involving the application of s 40(1)(g) have involved circumstances in which a costs order has been made in an interlocutory application and the question as to whether the "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" sought to be relied upon could have been raised in that interlocutory application. Notwithstanding the interlocutory nature of a proceeding, reliance in such cases is placed upon s 40(3) of the 1966 Act which relevantly provides as follows: For the purposes of paragraph (1)(g): ... (b) a judgment or order that is enforceable as, or in the same manner as, a final judgment obtained in an action shall be deemed to be a final judgment so obtained and the proceedings in which, or in consequence of which, the judgment or order was obtained shall be deemed to be the action in which it was obtained; ... One such decision is Re Gould; Ex parte Skinner (1983) 72 FLR 393. An application had there been made for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the sale of property. That application failed because there was a failure to establish that an undertaking as to damages would have had any substance. The cross-claim or set off was there said to be a claim for damages for breach of an obligation as encumbrancee to exercise reasonable care with respect to the sale of the property. That cross-claim or set-off, Fitzgerald J held, could not have been set up in the action seeking the interlocutory injunction. His Honour concluded (at 407 8): It was not in dispute before me that the order for costs upon the dismissal of the application for an interlocutory injunction in Queensland Supreme Court action No 1473 of 1982 is one which is enforceable as or in the same manner as a final judgment obtained in an action in that Court. The order for costs is therefore deemed by s 40(3)(b) of the Act to be a ""final judgment so obtained"", that is, a ""final judgment"" obtained in an ""action"". However, s 40(3)(b) of the Act does not stop there; the ""action"" is identified. For the purposes of s 40(1)(g), the statutory fiction effected by the deeming is extended to convert the ""proceedings"" in which the order was in fact obtained into the ""action"" in which the notional ""final judgment"" was obtained. In my opinion, the test in such circumstances called for by s 40(1)(g) of the Act is to ascertain not whether the cross demand could have been set up in the Supreme Court action No 1473 of 1982, but whether it could have been set up in the deemed action, the proceeding in which the order for costs was made, that is, the application for an interlocutory injunction in that action. The answer is clearly negative. ... Another comparable decision is Chesson v Smith (1992) 35 FCR 594. An application had there been filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking leave to commence proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 (NSW) out of time. The application was dismissed with costs. A certificate of taxation issued and, subsequently, a bankruptcy notice. It was accepted that there was a cross demand which exceeded the debt. But it was not a cross demand which could have been set up in the "" proceeding "", that "" proceeding "" either being the application for the interlocutory order for leave or the application for the costs order in that interlocutory application. 34 In the present Application there was a lack of precision in the identification by the Applicant of the "" action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained "". At the outset of oral submissions it was contended that the "" action or proceeding "" was to be found in the Supreme Court proceedings and was either: (i) the claim for declaratory relief, together with costs; or, more narrowly (ii) the claim for the costs order. An analogy was sought to be drawn between the interlocutory nature of the "" proceeding "" before Hall J in the Supreme Court and the decisions in Re Gould and Chesson v Smith . The narrower the identification of the "" proceeding "", the easier the Applicant contended it was to conclude that the claim in respect of losses could not have been set up as an answer. A more broadly phrased submission advanced on behalf of the Applicant in his written submission was that "" where an order for costs is made on an interlocutory application within other proceedings, that interlocutory application is itself deemed to be the action in which the relevant order is obtained (see s40(3)(b)) "". By the end of oral submissions, however, the Applicant contended that the "" action or proceeding "" was: (iii) the "" proceeding "" in the District Court whereby judgment was entered for the sum of money assessed in the Certificate of Determination of Costs ."

Case492,followed,Clark v UDC Finance Ltd [1985] 2 NZLR 636,"Consistent with the legislative objective sought to be achieved by s 40(1)(g) , it has been held that the phrase "" could not have been set up "" refers to a "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" which could not have been set up as a matter of law; a mere failure to take advantage of an opportunity to do so does not fall within s 40(1)(g): Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323. Fisher J there usefully summarised as follows some of the relevant authorities (at 326): The relevant words of the Act were considered by Lockhart J in Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd. (1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... . Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'""

""I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."" The judgment debtor was there asserting that, despite his best endeavours, he could not obtain "" factual and expert evidence "" to establish his counterclaim.

His Honour granted leave to the parties "" to bring in short minutes of orders to give effect to the orders proposed "": Esber v Massih [2006] NSWSC 321. That was done by way of orders made on 8 March 2007, including an order that "" there be an account of such profits "" and an order that the "" Defendant pay the Plaintiff's costs of the proceedings as assessed or agreed "". 11 A Certificate of Determination of Costs dated 15 October 2007 certified that the present Applicant was to pay costs in the sum of $77,498.96. 12 On 8 May 2008 a Notice of Motion was filed in the Supreme Court seeking leave to file and serve a Cross-Claim or seeking a variation of the judgment of Hall J by way of a declaration that "" the defendant is entitled to contribution from the plaintiff to half of any losses from the development and sale of the property "". An Amended Notice of Motion was resolved by Acting Justice Bryson on 31 July 2008 when His Honour concluded in relevant part: [4] The order which the trial Judge made on that subject was, obviously in its terms, interlocutory; it is not a final order and could not be the source of any estoppel or res judicata. The order speaks extremely briefly of an account of profits, obviously in contemplation of further detailed directions about the taking of such an account and about what was to be done with the matter ascertained on taking the account. ... [6] An order for an account of profits, including the order made on 8 March 2007 which used ""such profits"" to refer back to the declaration previously made, on its ordinary and natural meaning and without any further exposition is an order for an account of losses if matter accounted for should have generated losses. If the Court had intended anything so strange as an account or enquiry limited only to profits, and to leave ascertainment of losses, if there should be any, to be neglected and not dealt with, there would have been a marked departure from the Court's statutory duty to resolve the whole controversy. If the order of 8 March 2007 had been intended to effect any [sic] so strange a result I am confident that it would say so in a highly explicit manner. 13 Those provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of immediate relevance to the Application now before this Court are ss 40(1)(g) and 41 (7). 14 Section 40(1)(g) of the 1966 Act provides as follows: Acts of bankruptcy (1) A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in each of the following cases: ... (g) if a creditor who has obtained against the debtor a final judgment or final order, being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed, has served on the debtor in Australia or, by leave of the Court, elsewhere, a bankruptcy notice under this Act and the debtor does not: (i) where the notice was served in Australia--within the time specified in the notice; or (ii) where the notice was served elsewhere--within the time fixed for the purpose by the order giving leave to effect the service; comply with the requirements of the notice or satisfy the Court that he or she has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt or sum payable under the final order, as the case may be, being a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand that he or she could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained; ..."
Case497,followed,"Franks v Warringah Council [2003] FCA 1047 , 131 FCR 287","It is not considered that the "" final judgment or final order "" could be constituted by the order for costs made by the Supreme Court, either on its own or together with the Certificate of Determination of Costs : Franks v Warringah Council [2003] FCA 1047 , 131 FCR 287. A certificate that sets out the determination of the costs assessor, without being filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, is not sufficient to found a bankruptcy notice: Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 at [53] , 157 FCR 313 at 319 per Jacobson J. In Franks , the Land and Environment Court had there ordered that the Council's costs be agreed or assessed under the then Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW). A bankruptcy notice was served, the schedule to which stated that costs had been so assessed and annexed a certificate. Branson J summarised the submissions there being advanced as follows: [16] It was submitted by the Council that the argument that it could only recover its costs by filing in a court of competent jurisdiction a certificate issued pursuant to s 208J of the Legal Profession Act was contrary to established authority and the proper construction of the relevant legislation. The Council submitted that in respect of each order of the Land and Environment Court, having received the determination of the costs assessor, it had two options open to it for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act . The first option, it argued, was the option of filing the certificate issued under s 208J of the Legal Profession Act in a court of competent jurisdiction and issuing a bankruptcy notice on the judgment thereby deemed to have been obtained. The second option, it argued, was the option which it in fact adopted; that is, the option of issuing a bankruptcy notice founded on the order of the Land and Environment Court supported by the certificate issued under s 208J. The Council contended that the second of these options remained open to it even after it had filed in a court of competent jurisdiction the certificate issued by the costs assessor. Her Honour reviewed the authorities and then concluded: [30] The submissions of the Council identified in [16] are, in my view, unsustainable. Section 40(1)(g) does not, as it seems to me, admit of the possibility that a creditor may have obtained against a debtor more than one final judgment or final order in respect of the one debt, or perhaps more accurately, sourced from the same obligation. Further, s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act refers only to final judgments and final orders that can be enforced by a writ of execution (Re Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson (1975) 38 FLR 184 at 198 per Riley J). I incline to the view that Pt 44 r 7 of the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), as presently worded, does not allow a writ of execution to issue in respect of the orders of the Land and Environment Court on which reliance is here placed. It seems to me to be implicit in Pt 44, r 7, as presently worded, that a writ of execution may only issue in respect of costs determined under the Legal Profession Act to enforce a judgment entered as a result of the filing of a certificate under the Legal Profession Act . ... [32] I conclude that each of the bankruptcy notices should be set aside on the basis that it is fatally flawed because the judgment or order upon which it is founded, and which is attached to it as required by Form 1, is not ""a final judgment or final order, being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed"" within the meaning of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act ."
Case498,followed,"Guss v Johnstone [2000] HCA 26 , 171 ALR 598","To "" satisfy "" the Court it is not necessary for the debtor to prove, as on a final hearing, the asserted entitlement to recover as against the creditor. That which is to be established is whether the Court is "" satisfied "" that the debtor "" has a claim deserving to be finally determined "": Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell [2003] FCA 373 at [11] , [2003] FCA 373 ; 198 ALR 331 at 334. Lindgren J there observed: [9] There are authorities suggesting that Glew and Tresidder must satisfy me of the following interrelated and sometimes overlapping matters: &#8226; that they have a ""prima facie case"", even if they do not adduce evidence which would be admissible on a final hearing making out that case... &#8226; that they have ""a fair chance of success"" or are ""fairly entitled to litigate"" the claim... and &#8226; that they are advancing a ""genuine"" or ""bona fide"" claim...

In [Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1980) 44 FLR 135] Lockhart J treated (at ALR 438 9; FLR 141) the reference to a ""prima facie case"" ... as a reference to ""a fair chance of success"". This was subsequently characterised by His Honour as a "" relatively low threshold "": at [64].

Case499,considered,In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431,"The present Bankruptcy Notice was served on 11 February 2008 requiring either payment or the making of an "" arrangement to the creditor's satisfaction for settlement of the debt "" within 21 days. Annexed to the Bankruptcy Notice was a Certificate of Judgment of the District Court certifying the recovery of judgment in that Court. 5 The Application was filed in this Court on 29 February 2008. That Application seeks an order setting aside the Bankruptcy Notice . The power of this Court to set aside a bankruptcy notice was not questioned: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 30 ALR 77 at 83 per Lockhart J; Dimasi v Nangiloc Colignan Farms Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 308 at [25] , [2007] FCA 308 ; 239 ALR 330 at 337 per Ryan J. 6 In the present proceeding it is claimed that the Applicant has "" a counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand as referred to in s 40(1)(g) "" of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). Section 41(7) of the 1966 Act has the effect that, upon that Application having been filed, the time for compliance with the Notice is deemed to have been extended until the Court determines the Application . 7 The "" counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand "" relied upon by the present Applicant is his right to set-off the losses incurred in respect to the development of the Merrylands property. These losses, it is accepted by the parties, exceed the judgment debt upon which the Bankruptcy Notice is founded. 8 That "" counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand "" is said by the Applicant to be one that he "" could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained "" within the meaning of and for the purposes of s 40(1)(g). 9 The litigation in the Supreme Court dates back to 2004 when an Amended Statement of Claim was apparently filed seeking declaratory relief as to the arrangement between the parties in respect to the development property. To be resolved was whether the nature of any arrangement between the then Plaintiff and Defendant was simply one whereby work was performed in return for remuneration or whether the parties would each be entitled to a 50% share of profits on sale. 23 In In re Judd, Ex parte Pike, supra, Maughan AJ observed that the word "" counter-claim "" most probably refers to "" those claims which might be the subject of a counter-claim in equity ""; the term "" set-off "" was said to refer to "" those claims which might be the subject of a set-off at common law "". And the term "" cross demand "" was said to be "" not a technical term and must ... refer to claims other than those which would be comprised in the two expressions 'counter-claim' and 'set-off' "": (1924) 24 SR (NSW) 537 at 539. An "" unrestricted meaning "", it was said, was to be given to the word "" cross demand "" (at 540). The meaning of each of these terms was also explored in In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431. Declaratory relief sought in the Chancery Division as to an entitlement to a charge on the proceeds of property was held not to be a "" counter-claim, set-off or cross demand "". Lord Hanworth MR there observed that "" set-off "" was "" a word well known and established in its meaning "" (at 437). Of the term "" cross demand "" it was observed (at 438): I turn, therefore, to what to my mind is the wider word, ""cross-demand."" If a cross-demand is only to be interpreted as meaning something which could have been introduced into the action by way of counterclaim, it adds nothing to the word ""counterclaim."" ""Cross-demand"" seems to me to be a word introduced in order to give a wider ambit to the meaning of these claims, something that would not be described, certainly, as a set-off, something that could not have been brought in the action, something that still lies outside a counterclaim, but is of a nature which can be specified and which is of such a nature that it equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt. I do not desire to say what ""cross-demand"" may include, but it is not difficult to say that it does not include a claim of such uncertain nature as appears in these Chancery proceedings. That claim does not appear to be one which it would be proper to describe as a cross-demand; it is a claim of right which may inure ultimately for the benefit of the judgment debtor. Therefore, it appears that there is no sufficient ground for setting aside this bankruptcy notice; the bankruptcy notice stands good and must be complied with. Romer and Maugham LJJ delivered separate judgments but agreed with Lord Hanworth MR. 37 Attached to the Bankruptcy Notice as served upon the Applicant on 11 February 2008 was the judgment of the District Court, being the Certificate of Judgment signed by the Registrar of that Court. For the purposes of s 40(1)(g) , the "" action or proceeding "" in which that judgment was obtained was necessarily the District Court proceeding. "" A proceeding "", it may be noted, "" may mean something as distinct from an action or any step thereunder in which final orders are made for the payment of money. It may also mean a step in an action, in which proceeding a final order is made for the payment of money "": Re Black; Ex parte Jeffery (1932) 4 ABC 157 at 160 per Lukin J. 38 The judgment entered by that Court was entered as a consequence of the Certificate having been issued in respect to those costs which had been ordered to be paid by the Supreme Court and the subsequent filing of that Certificate by the Respondent with the District Court. There was no suggestion that that judgment had in fact been stayed. The Bankruptcy Notice as served stated that it had not been stayed. 39 The process whereby that judgment came to be entered by the District Court is regulated by the provisions of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) and the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) . 46 The result of the present Application, it is considered, can be stated simply. For the purposes of the present Application , it was accepted that the joint venture agreement as between the Applicant and the Respondent gave rise to losses, those losses being said to be approximately $160,000. Those losses obviously exceed the judgment debt of $77,498.96. But, as at the date upon which the Bankruptcy Notice was served in February 2008, no account had been taken -- as had been ordered by Hall J in March 2007. Whether an account had or had not been taken, however, those losses could not have been set up during the process whereby the costs assessor made a determination as to costs. Nor could those losses have been set up in opposition to the filing of the Certificate of the costs assessor with the District Court and the judgment thereafter being taken to have been made by reason of s 368(5) of the Legal Profession Act . 47 The Application to have the Bankruptcy Notice as served on 11 February 2008 set aside should thus be allowed. 48 The orders of the Court are: 1. The Application be allowed. 2. The Bankruptcy Notice No NN 0290 of 2008 be set aside. 3. The Respondent is to pay the costs of the Applicant. I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Flick.

(1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... .

The fact that such a "" tortuous route "" had to be followed did not mean that the proceeding could not have been set up in the Federal Court. His Honour reviewed some of the authorities and concluded (at 137): These cases, it seems to me, establish that a cross-claim will be one which could be set up in the action, notwithstanding that to do so the debtor may need to transfer the proceedings first to another court, or may need to obtain in his or her favour the exercise of a discretion before doing so. The onus of showing that the claim is not one that could have been set up in the creditor's proceedings lies upon the debtor. That onus will not be satisfied merely by showing that some indirect course may need be followed (that course being in the discretion of the debtor) nor by showing that there existed a discretion which could have been exercised against the setting up of the claim as a cross-claim. To satisfy that onus the debtor must show that, as a matter of law and in the circumstances prevailing, he or she could not have set up the cross-claim.

It is no part of their function to determine whether or when such costs are payable. The matters set out in s 208A which they must, and in s 208B which they may, take into account are all matters relevant to putting a value on the work done or services rendered and the fairness or justice of the amount claimed; but are not matters which relate to the terms of a costs agreement (particularly if oral) and whether any conditions precedent to payment have been fulfilled. The determination of such questions requires the reception of sworn evidence, which can be tested by cross-examination, and an assessment of such evidence. Costs Assessors do not have the power to deal with such matters. [57] For similar reasons it has been held that a Costs Assessor has no power to hear a cross-claim by a client against a solicitor based on negligence, nor to award damages: Ryan v Hansen, supra per Kirby J; or to make an assessment when no costs are presently due and payable: Lace v Younan [1999] NSWSC 1072 per Master Harrison (no bill of costs rendered); Baker v Kearney [2002] NSWSC 746 per Master Malpass (judgment in District Court that applicant for assessment not entitled to costs). I am therefore satisfied that on being notified of the dispute as to the plaintiff's liability to pay the costs, the Costs Assessor should have declined to make a determination or issued a certificate unless and until such issue was resolved. Nothing said by the Court of Appeal in Wentworth v Rogers [2006] NSWCA 145 , 66 NSWLR 474 detracts from this particular conclusion of Dunford J. See also: Ryan v Hansen [2000] NSWSC 354 , 49 NSWLR 184. The same observations may be made in respect to the 2004 legislation."

Case515,considered,Re Gould; Ex parte Skinner (1983) 72 FLR 393,"Some decisions involving the application of s 40(1)(g) have involved circumstances in which a costs order has been made in an interlocutory application and the question as to whether the "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" sought to be relied upon could have been raised in that interlocutory application. Notwithstanding the interlocutory nature of a proceeding, reliance in such cases is placed upon s 40(3) of the 1966 Act which relevantly provides as follows: For the purposes of paragraph (1)(g): ... (b) a judgment or order that is enforceable as, or in the same manner as, a final judgment obtained in an action shall be deemed to be a final judgment so obtained and the proceedings in which, or in consequence of which, the judgment or order was obtained shall be deemed to be the action in which it was obtained; ... One such decision is Re Gould; Ex parte Skinner (1983) 72 FLR 393. An application had there been made for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the sale of property. That application failed because there was a failure to establish that an undertaking as to damages would have had any substance. The cross-claim or set off was there said to be a claim for damages for breach of an obligation as encumbrancee to exercise reasonable care with respect to the sale of the property. That cross-claim or set-off, Fitzgerald J held, could not have been set up in the action seeking the interlocutory injunction. His Honour concluded (at 407 8): It was not in dispute before me that the order for costs upon the dismissal of the application for an interlocutory injunction in Queensland Supreme Court action No 1473 of 1982 is one which is enforceable as or in the same manner as a final judgment obtained in an action in that Court. The order for costs is therefore deemed by s 40(3)(b) of the Act to be a ""final judgment so obtained"", that is, a ""final judgment"" obtained in an ""action"". However, s 40(3)(b) of the Act does not stop there; the ""action"" is identified. For the purposes of s 40(1)(g), the statutory fiction effected by the deeming is extended to convert the ""proceedings"" in which the order was in fact obtained into the ""action"" in which the notional ""final judgment"" was obtained. In my opinion, the test in such circumstances called for by s 40(1)(g) of the Act is to ascertain not whether the cross demand could have been set up in the Supreme Court action No 1473 of 1982, but whether it could have been set up in the deemed action, the proceeding in which the order for costs was made, that is, the application for an interlocutory injunction in that action. The answer is clearly negative. ... Another comparable decision is Chesson v Smith (1992) 35 FCR 594. An application had there been filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking leave to commence proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 (NSW) out of time. The application was dismissed with costs. A certificate of taxation issued and, subsequently, a bankruptcy notice. It was accepted that there was a cross demand which exceeded the debt. But it was not a cross demand which could have been set up in the "" proceeding "", that "" proceeding "" either being the application for the interlocutory order for leave or the application for the costs order in that interlocutory application. 34 In the present Application there was a lack of precision in the identification by the Applicant of the "" action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained "". At the outset of oral submissions it was contended that the "" action or proceeding "" was to be found in the Supreme Court proceedings and was either: (i) the claim for declaratory relief, together with costs; or, more narrowly (ii) the claim for the costs order. An analogy was sought to be drawn between the interlocutory nature of the "" proceeding "" before Hall J in the Supreme Court and the decisions in Re Gould and Chesson v Smith . The narrower the identification of the "" proceeding "", the easier the Applicant contended it was to conclude that the claim in respect of losses could not have been set up as an answer. A more broadly phrased submission advanced on behalf of the Applicant in his written submission was that "" where an order for costs is made on an interlocutory application within other proceedings, that interlocutory application is itself deemed to be the action in which the relevant order is obtained (see s40(3)(b)) "". By the end of oral submissions, however, the Applicant contended that the "" action or proceeding "" was: (iii) the "" proceeding "" in the District Court whereby judgment was entered for the sum of money assessed in the Certificate of Determination of Costs ."

(1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... . Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'"" In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p 730 Avory J said: ""I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action. ""I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."" The judgment debtor was there asserting that, despite his best endeavours, he could not obtain "" factual and expert evidence "" to establish his counterclaim. That was not sufficient to bring himself within s 40(1)(g). Fisher J concluded (at 326): In my opinion these statements of principle... determine the matter against the debtor. There was no reason in law why he could not set up his counterclaim in the creditor's proceedings. ...

A certificate that sets out the determination of the costs assessor, without being filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, is not sufficient to found a bankruptcy notice: Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 at [53] , 157 FCR 313 at 319 per Jacobson J. In Franks , the Land and Environment Court had there ordered that the Council's costs be agreed or assessed under the then Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW). A bankruptcy notice was served, the schedule to which stated that costs had been so assessed and annexed a certificate. Branson J summarised the submissions there being advanced as follows: [16] It was submitted by the Council that the argument that it could only recover its costs by filing in a court of competent jurisdiction a certificate issued pursuant to s 208J of the Legal Profession Act was contrary to established authority and the proper construction of the relevant legislation. The Council submitted that in respect of each order of the Land and Environment Court, having received the determination of the costs assessor, it had two options open to it for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act . The first option, it argued, was the option of filing the certificate issued under s 208J of the Legal Profession Act in a court of competent jurisdiction and issuing a bankruptcy notice on the judgment thereby deemed to have been obtained. The second option, it argued, was the option which it in fact adopted; that is, the option of issuing a bankruptcy notice founded on the order of the Land and Environment Court supported by the certificate issued under s 208J. The Council contended that the second of these options remained open to it even after it had filed in a court of competent jurisdiction the certificate issued by the costs assessor. Her Honour reviewed the authorities and then concluded: [30] The submissions of the Council identified in [16] are, in my view, unsustainable. Section 40(1)(g) does not, as it seems to me, admit of the possibility that a creditor may have obtained against a debtor more than one final judgment or final order in respect of the one debt, or perhaps more accurately, sourced from the same obligation. Further, s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act refers only to final judgments and final orders that can be enforced by a writ of execution (Re Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson (1975) 38 FLR 184 at 198 per Riley J). I incline to the view that Pt 44 r 7 of the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), as presently worded, does not allow a writ of execution to issue in respect of the orders of the Land and Environment Court on which reliance is here placed. It seems to me to be implicit in Pt 44, r 7, as presently worded, that a writ of execution may only issue in respect of costs determined under the Legal Profession Act to enforce a judgment entered as a result of the filing of a certificate under the Legal Profession Act . ... [32] I conclude that each of the bankruptcy notices should be set aside on the basis that it is fatally flawed because the judgment or order upon which it is founded, and which is attached to it as required by Form 1, is not ""a final judgment or final order, being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed"" within the meaning of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act . 36 The "" final judgment or final order "" in the present proceeding, it was ultimately submitted by the Applicant, was the judgment of the District Court. The form of a bankruptcy notice is that prescribed by reg 4.02 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth) and clause 2 to that form provides as follows: The creditor claims that the debt is due and payable by you. A copy of the judgments or orders relied upon by the creditor is attached. At the time of applying for this Notice, execution of the judgments or orders had not been stayed. If a bankruptcy notice is to satisfy the requirements of s 41(1) and (2) of the Bankruptcy Act as to form, it must correctly identify the source of the bankrupt's liability to make the payment demanded by the notice: Re Gibbs; Ex parte Triscott (1995) 65 FCR 80 , 133 ALR 718 at 721 per Drummond J. Only a judgment upon which a creditor is in a position to issue execution when he issues the bankruptcy notice can constitute a final judgment for the purposes of s 40(1)(g): cf. Pepper v McNiece [1941] HCA 27 ; (1941) 64 CLR 642 at 657 per Williams J. A judgment which has been stayed may not found a bankruptcy notice: s 41(3)(b) ; Re Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson (1975) 38 FLR 184 at 187 8 per Riley J; Reasonable Endeavours Pty Ltd v Dennehy [2001] FCA 188 , 107 FCR 144."

Case532,cited,Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45,"in this case the defamatory meanings alleged to have been conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader are largely congruent with the representations alleged to have been made by the same publications in contravention of s 53B. In determining whether representations have been conveyed to the public (such as by a mass media or internet publication) the Court usually must identify the effect of the publication, including what representations it made, on ordinary or reasonable members of the public: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 85-86 [101] - [103] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Thus, here, a jury will be able to determine whether the representations alleged were made at the same time as deciding on whether the same defamatory meanings were conveyed. Ms Ra asserted that the length of the trial would increase from one to two weeks to four to five weeks if there were a jury. I reject that submission. In my opinion it is unlikely that the length of the trial will be any greater with a jury. Essentially, the issues for trial will revolve around the oral evidence of witnesses concerning what did or did not happen in Ms Ra's business so far as that relates to the issues in the matters complained of. Ms Ra also relied on a suggestion that the police or prosecution brief, for the purposes of the criminal proceedings, consisted of about 40 lever arch folders of documents. There was no evidence before me that any substantial amount of this material is likely to be adduced in evidence. The allegations that Ms Ra mistreated young women in her employ and exploited them by imposing significant debts on them which were not otherwise merited are the issues at the heart of this matter. It is unlikely that young women providing sexual services in a brothel would be engaged in keeping significant books of account, involving the necessity for prolonged examination of those documents. Nor would Ms Ra's records of their wages or debts be likely to be complex. Such documents as may be relevant to those issues are highly likely to be understood by a jury. If those documents were kept in a foreign language the jury would be likely to be concerned only with their translation. Again, these matters will be within relatively confined bounds and simple to understand."

Neither of those proceedings appears to have involved an individual's right to his or her personal reputation or allegations of the kind involved in the publications complained of here. This factor was considered to be of significance by Tamberlin J in Stalyce Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd v Cetec Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR p41-866 at 44,852 [15]."
Case534,discussed,Hawke v Tamworth Newspaper Co Ltd [1983] 1 NSWLR 699,"the other hand, Hunt J refused the Prime Minister of Australia a jury of 12 in respect of the publication in a country newspaper of an allegedly defamatory letter. That occurred more than a year before he became Prime Minister in Hawke v Tamworth Newspaper Co Ltd [1983] 1 NSWLR 699 at 706E-707B. Where a person is a contentious figure or one with a prominent public role, his or her position as a party to an action tried before a jury may cause concern about its potential effect on a jury of 4 persons. He or she is more likely to be given a dispassionate and fair trial by a jury of 12. This is because a larger jury is more likely to dilute the influence of any single juror whose passions or antipathies are aroused for or against one of the parties. Balanced against that concern, must be the Court's recognition that jurors obey the directions of trial judges to put aside their own personal prejudices and feelings. And members of a jury panel ordinarily can be expected to accept the invitation before being called to the box, to indicate whether they feel they could not bring an impartial and dispassionate mind to the resolution of the issues for trial or by reason of the matters disclosed to them as to what the proceedings are about and who the parties are; see s 38(8) of the Jury Act which provides: ""(8) Before the selection of the jury at a civil trial, the judge must, subject to the regulations: (a) direct the parties to the proceedings to inform the jurors on the panel of the nature of the action and the identity of the parties and of the principal witnesses to be called by the parties, and (b) call on the jurors on the panel to apply to be excused if they consider that they are not able to give impartial consideration to the case."" Here the publications are in a daily newspaper with a large circulation in Sydney, and contemporaneous internet publications of the same or similar material. They allege criminal and other serious wrongdoing by Ms Ra. And she has the highly contentious occupation of running a brothel. I am comfortably satisfied that the nature of the publications complained of here and the fact that, on this application at least, no challenge has been made to their capacity to convey the imputations alleged raise matters which could well excite prejudice in some members of the community, particularly those with strong moral views against Ms Ra. Such moral views might be held by a member of the jury. I am of opinion that an expanded jury of 12 is more likely to reflect and balance the range of community values, morality and thought so as to ensure a fair trial. Accordingly, I will grant Ms Ra's application that the jury be a jury of 12."

In Lang v Australian Consolidated Press Limited [1967] 1 NSWR 157 , Nagle J held that the test to be employed was a quantitative one rather than a qualitative one and said: ""... a jury of 12 would seem to give a better 'spread' and be more representative of the views of the community as a whole."""

Case542,discussed,R v Shipley ( The Dean of St Asaph's Case ) (1784) 4 Doug 73,"Suk Ra is a brothel owner. She commenced these proceedings against the publisher of The Daily Telegraph newspaper, Nationwide News Pty Limited and its associated company, News Digital Media Pty Limited. News Digital publishes material on the internet including extracts from the Daily Telegraph . On 3 December 2008, The Daily Telegraph also published an editorial headed ""Sydney's Own Horror House"". The text of the editorial appears to have been republished on the internet by News Digital on either 3 or 4 December. On the same day the Daily Telegraph published an article under the headline ""Sex Slave Trade Revealed"". The article had a subheading, ""Brothel Madam Walks Scott Free"". On 4 December 2008, News Digital published an internet article headed ""No Way Out for Women in Debt and Total Despair"". A web blog or section on the News Digital website allowed readers to post comments on this article. On and after 4 December 2008 a number of comments were posted on this part of the website. Ms Ra claimed that each of these publications contravened s 53B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). She alleged that one or other of the publishers had engaged in conduct that was liable to mislead persons seeking such employment as to the nature, terms or conditions of that employment by making a variety of misleading representations in each of the five publications in relation to employment that was or may be offered by her. In times less free than those in which we now live, the charge of criminal libel was often employed as a means of censoring freedom of expression and opinion. Until the passage of Fox's Libel Act in 1792 (32 Geo 3 c 60), the judges of England had asserted that it was their province to determine whether or not a matter was defamatory: R v Shipley ( The Dean of St Asaph's Case ) (1784) 4 Doug 73 at 164-165 per Lord Mansfield CJ, as explained by Lord Blackburn in The Capital and Counties Bank v Henty (1882) 7 App Cas 741 at 772-776. But juries constantly defied them by refusing to convict on a direction by a judge that the matter complained of was libellous. Fox's Libel Act squarely placed the decision of whether or not the matter complained of was a libel in the hands of the jury, and there it has remained in England to the present time, as it has until recent times in many of the Australian States. Lord Denning graphically explained, in his inimitable style, some of the history that informed the passage of Fox's Libel Act in Landmarks in The Law (1984) at 284-294."
Case543,followed,Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16 ; (2009) 254 ALR 606,"concept of ""reputation"" in the law of defamation comprehends all aspects of a person's standing in the community: Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16 ; (2009) 254 ALR 606 at 616 [36] per French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ. The importance of the law of defamation in balancing the right of an individual to the protection of his or her reputation and the right commonly described as freedom of speech plays a crucial role in our democratic system of government. That balance is affected at common law by the operation of the defence of qualified privilege as elaborated in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 , see at 565-576 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The test does not imply that the hypothetical referees will exercise a moral judgment about the plaintiff or applicant because of what is said about him or her. Rather, the test identifies the attributes of persons who share the standards of the general community and will apply them: Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38]. And, the moral or ethical standards held by the general community may be relevant to imputations which reflect upon a person's business or professional reputation: Chesterton 254 ALR at 618 [46]. The standard to be applied must be one common to society rather than one which reflects an attitude of a section of it: Chesterton 254 ALR at 619 [48]. French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ continued ( Chesterton 254 ALR at 618 [46]: ""In such cases the ordinary reasonable person may be expected to draw upon such community standards as may be relevant, in order to answer the question whether there has been injury to that reputation."" I am of opinion that the essential balances that will need to be struck in respect of the critical issues in this matter (other than damages) are quintessentially better determined by a jury. This assessment will best be done by the community referees to whom French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ referred in Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38], 618 [46], 619 [48] as did Brennan J in Lamb 150 CLR at 506. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the ends of justice render it expedient to direct a trial by jury of all issues in the proceedings, other than damages and any other issue which, pursuant to the Defamation Act would not be left to the jury. Thus, the question of the capacity of the matters complained of to convey any of the defamatory meanings alleged (as opposed to whether they in fact were conveyed) would remain a question of law to be decided by a judge. The part of this controversy that arises under s 53B of the Trade Practices Act should also be decided by a jury. This is because it is inextricably related to the meanings conveyed to ordinary reasonable readers by the matters complained of and whether Ms Ra has been injured in her reputation as an employer for the purposes of s 53B. However, if the jury returned a verdict in her favour on the issues of liability, the amount of compensation to be awarded pursuant to s 82 of that Act should be assessed by a judge."
Case544,followed,Reader's Digest Services Pty Limited v Lamb [1982] HCA 4 ; (1982) 150 CLR 500,"of the great virtues of having a jury try the substantial factual issues in a defamation action is that they represent the very audience to which the defamatory publication was addressed. In assessing whether or not a publication, first, is defamatory in the sense complained of and, secondly, has been defended under defences such as truth, honest opinion or fair report, a jury of ordinary reasonable people is able to evaluate the competing factual issues bringing to bear the moral and social standards that they share with the community at large. And, they are better placed than judicial officers to assess how ordinary reasonable people understand mass media publications. In Reader's Digest Services Pty Limited v Lamb [1982] HCA 4 ; (1982) 150 CLR 500 at 505-506 Brennan J, with whom Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Murphy and Wilson JJ agreed said: ""Where no true innuendo is pleaded and the published words clearly related to the plaintiff, the issue of libel or no libel can be determined by asking whether hypothetical referees -- Lord Selborne's reasonable men ( Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty (1882) LR 7 App Cas 741 , at p 745) or Lord Atkin's right-thinking members of society generally ( Sim v. Stretch (1936) 52 TLR 669 , at p 671) or Lord Reid's ordinary men not avid for scandal ( Lewis v. Daily Telegraph Ltd. [1964] AC, at p 260)) -- would understand the published words in a defamatory sense. That simple question embraces two elements of the cause of action: the meaning of the words used (the imputation) and the defamatory character of the imputation. Whether the alleged libel is established depends upon the understanding of the hypothetical referees who are taken to have a uniform view of the meaning of the language used, and upon the standards, moral or social, by which they evaluate the imputation they understand to have been made. They are taken to share a moral or social standard by which to judge the defamatory character of that imputation ( Byrne v. Deane [1937] 1 KB 818 , at p. 833, being a standard common to society generally ( Miller v. David (1874) LR 9 CP 118 ; Myroft v. Sleight (1921) 90 LJKB 883 ; Tolley v. J.S. Fry &amp; Sons Ltd. [1930] 1 KB 467, at p. 479)."" (emphasis added) Brennan J went on to say ( Lamb 150 CLR at 506): ""But the moral or social standard by which the defamatory character of an imputation is determined is not amenable to evidentiary proof; it is pre-eminently a matter for the jury to give effect to a standard which they consider to accord with the attitude of society generally ."" (emphasis added) This matter raises issues that very much involve giving effect to moral and social values of the community. I am satisfied that a trial by a jury would be a better mode of trial than by judge alone to assess the various claims and defences in these defamation proceedings. The jury will be better able to make such an assessment than a judge and to do so in a way likely to arrive at a reflection of the attitude of society generally: Lamb 150 CLR at 506. I am of opinion that the essential balances that will need to be struck in respect of the critical issues in this matter (other than damages) are quintessentially better determined by a jury. This assessment will best be done by the community referees to whom French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ referred in Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38], 618 [46], 619 [48] as did Brennan J in Lamb 150 CLR at 506.

(2) Despite subsection (1), if a court hearing a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act (other than an application under section 663) is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has, by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding, the court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs.' 5 Subsection (1) of s 824 was based upon an earlier provision in s 347(1) of the WRA: see the Explanatory Memorandum to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 (Cth).

Case552,considered,Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (WA) v Woolworths Ltd (2006) 149 IR 213,"The respondents' construction of s 824(1) was founded upon Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (WA) v Woolworths Ltd (2006) 149 IR 213 (' Woolworths' ). The case concerned the costs of a directions hearing at which the applicant advised the Court that it no longer wished to pursue its claim for interim relief to restrain the certification of an agreement under the WRA. The claim was not pursued because the agreement had in fact been certified after the institution of the proceedings but prior to the directions date, without the knowledge of the applicant. The respondent sought costs on the basis that the applicant had not mounted its interim application urgently and in accordance with the rules concerning the filing of affidavit evidence. 14 In the present case, the respondents relied on Nicholson J's statement at 214-215 [8] that the proviso to s 347(1) afforded no ground for making a costs order in respect of a step in the proceeding, as distinguished from the institution of the proceeding. However, it is not clear that the reference by Nicholson J to a 'step in the proceeding' was directed to the application for interim relief, rather than to particular procedural 'steps' in relation to that application. On my reading, Nicholson J was treating the application for interim relief as a step in the proceeding, as he went on to say at 214-215 [8] that: 'the proceeding was instituted with reasonable cause and [was] one which remained, in the applicant's mind, reasonable throughout, until it learnt eventually of the certification of the agreement.' This simply amounts to a finding that, on the facts, costs should not be ordered under the proviso to s 347(1) because the interlocutory application was not instituted 'vexatiously or without reasonable cause'. In my opinion, Woolworths does not support the respondents' contention that costs cannot be awarded under 824(1) in respect of an interlocutory notice of motion."

Case568,followed,Bissett v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 365,"Section 84(5) of the Native Title Act provides that the Federal Court may join any person as a party to proceedings under the Act if it is satisfied that 'the person's interests may be affected by a determination in the proceedings'. NTS is no stranger to applications made under this section. In Bissett v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 365 , Tamberlin J considered an application for the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council to withdraw as a party from a native title proceeding and for NTS to be joined as a party. In December 2001 the status of the Land Council as a Native Title Representative Body was withdrawn at its own request. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission decided to grant funds to NTS to assist in certain activities including carrying out the functions of a representative body as set out in s 203B of the Native Title Act ."
Case569,referred to,Byron Environment Centre Incorporated v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1,"In deciding whether NTS had the requisite interest under s 84(5) , Tamberlin J applied the principles identified by the Full Court in Byron Environment Centre Incorporated v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1. His Honour agreed with the views of Katz J in Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of NSW [2001] FCA 419 ; (2001) 108 FCR 527 that despite amendments to the Native Title Act the reasoning in Byron was applicable to the case before him. His Honour summarised the Full Court's views as follows, at [13]: 'In Byron Environment Centre , the Full Court held that although the relevant ""interests"" are not confined to interest in land or water, they do not extend to mere emotional associations, ideological or bare intellectual interests in the subject matter of the application. The ""interests"" must not be indirect, remote or lacking in substance and must be capable of clear definition such that they may be affected in a discernible way in relation to the application: at 7-10 per Black CJ.' 7 Tamberlin J considered the functions of a representative body and considered that they would be facilitated if NTS were a party to the proceeding. His Honour also observed that the expression, 'a determination in the proceedings' should not be equated with a final determination of native title rights. In considering the nature of the 'interests' referred to in the section, his Honour said at [24]: 'In relation to the asserted appropriateness of a narrow construction of the expression ""interests"" because of a power to veto an otherwise agreed settlement, the provisions of s 84(8) should be borne in mind. The provision empowers the Court at any time to order a party other than an applicant to cease to be a party to the proceedings. This power could be invoked by the Court if a representative body is a party to the proceedings and adopts a grossly unreasonable approach in relation to a proposed consensual determination of the proceedings. In addition, it should be kept in mind that the Court must always be satisfied that the person or body has the requisite interest in any particular circumstances and this provides a safeguard on the extent to which other persons or bodies can be joined.' 8 Tamberlin J held that NTS had a sufficient interest to meet the requirement of s 84(5) and that the application for joinder should be allowed. For the same reasons I am satisfied that NTS has sufficient interest in the compensation application and the order for joinder in this proceeding should be made. 9 NTS has brought the present application to dismiss the proceedings under O 35A r3(1) of the Federal Court Rules because of a failure to progress the compensation claim. The following history of the matter, which I accept as correct, is taken from the affidavit of Mr Savidis. 10 The compensation application covers an area ""identical to the external boundaries of the Barkandji Traditional Owner's Application (NSD 6084 of 1998)"" in which NTS is a party and the legal representative of the applicant. This application, known as the Barkandji #8 application, was first lodged with the Tribunal on 8 October 1997."

Sackville J expressed those reasons as follows (at [789]): &#8226; 'First, the applicants have not shown, on the evidence, that the indigenous witnesses, or members of the compensation claim group, acknowledged and observed at the relevant times the laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc as pleaded in the Points of Claim . &#8226; Secondly, I am not satisfied that any laws and customs relating to rights and interests in land that may have been acknowledged and observed by the Aboriginal witnesses are the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc, within the meaning of s 223(1) of the NTA.' 21 Given the lack of progress with the present application, there is no reasonable prospect of such evidence ever being produced. Under the circumstances, I accept that NTS has done everything possible to ensure that those who might have an interest in the claim have been consulted about the present application. They have obtained full support from all persons they have been able to contact except Dorothy and Phillip Lawson. I accept that NTS has been authorised by the Barkandji people to apply to have the compensation claim dismissed."

It also follows that there is no scope for the application of O 62 r 36A(2). 14 The applicant's submission was that the aforesaid costs should be assessed on an indemnity basis because the respondents' conduct was unreasonable. The respondents conceded liability on the copyright claim on the fifth day of trial so that any submission that costs should be assessed on an indemnity basis because of an unreasonable denial of liability cannot go beyond that time. 15 The circumstances in which an unsuccessful party may be ordered to pay costs on a basis other than a party and party basis have been considered in a number of authorities."

In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law. Such cases are, fortunately, rare. But when they occur, the Court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion."""
Case578,referred to,Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1621,"The applicant made a number of claims against the respondents. Those claims are outlined in my liability reasons: Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1621. The applicant was unsuccessful as to the majority of its claims. It was unsuccessful as to what it presented as the main claim, namely, that there was an implied term in a contract between it and Graphix Labels Pty Ltd which prevented Graphix Labels from manufacturing and selling skins. The applicant submitted that one order as to costs should be made and it should be an order in its favour. The problem for the applicant is that if it is appropriate to make only one order as to costs, and that order should be in favour of the successful party, or the party who has been largely successful, then neither party has been wholly successful, and it is the respondents who have been largely successful. The respondents have been largely successful in that they have resisted the majority of the applicant's claims including what was the main claim advanced by the applicant. The applicant's counsel attempted to argue that in terms of witnesses and their evidence, the case and the costs associated with it would have been the same, or more or less the same, even if it had not pursued the claims upon which it was unsuccessful. He also submitted that the applicant had been successful as to some claims and unsuccessful as to others. The applicant's attempts to characterise the proceedings in that way must fail because the fact is that the applicant failed on its main claim and the bulk of its other claims. My reasons for reaching that conclusion are apparent from my liability reasons and require no further elaboration. 7 For their part, the respondents submitted that the success or benefit ultimately achieved by the applicant in pursuing the proceedings, as reflected in my orders, was slight, whereas the costs were substantial. The success or benefit was submitted to be so slight that when regard is had to the undertakings as to the artworks offered by the respondent at the outset, the success or benefit achieved by the applicant should be ignored. As I understood the submission, it was that in practical terms the respondents have been successful. It follows, so it was submitted, that an order for costs should be made in their favour albeit the costs should be assessed on different bases for different periods. 8 In my opinion, the respondents' submission should be rejected for two reasons. First, the applicant has succeeded in its claim for infringement of copyright in relation to the artworks and for breach of an implied term in relation to samples containing the artworks. In relation to the first-mentioned claim, the applicant has received an award of damages including additional damages which, although modest, were based partly on a finding that the infringement was flagrant. Secondly, the undertakings proffered by the respondents to the applicant not to use the artworks were made with a denial of liability and did not include any indication that the respondents would pay damages or consent to an order for the assessment of damages. The applicant pointed out to the respondents in correspondence that they had not explained the basis upon which they denied liability for infringement of copyright. The denial of liability was maintained in the defence and indeed it was maintained until the fifth day of trial. I was told that the reason for the denial was that the respondents were not satisfied that the artworks were original works, but even if the reason for the denial is relevant, the particular reason was not conveyed to the applicant in their correspondence or in the defence in a way that may have reduced costs. It may be that the important fact is not that the respondents did not offer to pay damages or consent to an assessment of damages but, rather, the fact that ultimately the applicant received an award of damages."

The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 253-7.

The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 253-7. In Birdseye , Branson and Stone JJ held (at 325) that: ""... O 53 r 3(2) discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law . It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that, in our view, one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal"" (emphasis added)."
Case583,referred to,Australian Trade Commission v Underwood Exports Pty Ltd (1997) 49 ALD 411,"Kennedy complained that the Panel erred by failing to identify the evidence, if any, it relied on to arrive at the finding that the period of Mr Kennedy's serious misfortune was limited to the periods between February to November 1998 and from July 1999 to April 2000. It was submitted that, had it done so, it may have been possible to discern why it considered that Mr Kennedy had not established his claim for the longer period during which he said he had suffered such misfortune: see Australian Trade Commission v Underwood Exports Pty Ltd (1997) 49 ALD 411 at 422. In this Court he tacitly accepted the Panel's finding that the relevant period concluded in May 2000 and confined himself to arguing that the Panel should have found that he was incapacitated continuously from February 1998 to May 2000. To establish an error of law, Mr Kennedy must show that there was no evidence that was accepted by the Panel which supported its finding that the period of serious misfortune suffered by him was limited to February 1998 to November 1998 and from July 1999 to April 2000. The Panel dealt with the period of Mr Kennedy's serious misfortune in paragraphs 62 and 81-3 of its reasons: see at [21] above. In paragraph 83, the Panel found that ""on the whole of the evidence"" Mr Kennedy suffered serious misfortune for these two periods. Implicitly, it did not accept that Mr Kennedy suffered serious misfortune from December 1998 to June 1999 or from May 2000 to May 2001. In the course of its reasons the Panel referred to various parts of the evidence, including:"
Case584,applied,Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321,"complains that question (a) lacks precision because it does not specify for what period a permit must be ""active"". AFMA submits there are four potential periods: active over the whole five year qualifying period (1997 to 2001 inclusive), active over the best two years, active over one year or active over the period of serious misfortune. As a result, an answer to that question could not assist Mr Kennedy. Further, AFMA submits that the resolution of the question in 2(aa) would give Mr Kennedy no entitlement to relief nor would it identify an error of law: see Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 326-327. In any event, AFMA submits that the Panel did not make a finding upon which question 2(aa) is based. AFMA also complains that questions 2(d) and 2(e) do not raise pure questions of law. Section 161 of the Act, like s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (""the AAT Act""), allows an appeal to this Court only on a question of law. The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground an appeal under s 44, but is also the subject matter of the appeal itself: see TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 per Gummow J. The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 253-7. In Birdseye , Branson and Stone JJ held (at 325) that: ""... O 53 r 3(2) discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law . It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that, in our view, one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal"" (emphasis added). In other cases in which the Court has been confronted with this problem and in which it has determined that it might be possible to frame an appropriate question of law, it has done so itself: see, for example, Birdseye . Under the cover of its objections to the competency of the appeal, AFMA conceded that questions of law could possibly be framed and argued on the substantive issues raised by Mr Kennedy. In the event, AFMA will suffer no prejudice if I attempt to frame questions of law. In my view, it is possible to identify three questions of law: Whether, on the proper construction of s 27 of the Management Plan, AFMA and the Panel are bound to take into account all permits extant during the period of an eligible person's serious misfortune when determining ""the average catch of the species in the fishery under all sequences of that kind (old longline or old minor line, as the case may be)"" under s 27(1)(c)? Whether on the proper construction of s 27 of the Management Plan, AFMA and the Panel were bound to take into account all permits extant during the period of an eligible person's serious misfortune when determining ""the average number of times a longline was set in the fishery under all sequences of old longline permits"" under s 27(1)(d)? Whether there was any evidence before the Panel upon which it was open to it to find that the period of serious misfortune suffered by Mr Kennedy was limited to the periods from February 1998 to November 1998 and from July 1999 to April 2000? Section 27 is an ameliorative provision which operates to the benefit of an eligible person who has suffered serious misfortune. When a person has suffered serious misfortune, AFMA may calculate: the best two years' catches of a species of fish under the sequence of permits by using, for the period of serious misfortune, the average catch of the species in the fishery under all sequences of that kind (old longline or old minor line, as the case may be) during that period (s 27(1)(c)); and the best two years' sets for the relevant sequence of permits for step 1 of the definition of set history in s 26(3), by using, for the period of the serious misfortune, the average number of times a longline was set in the fishery under all sequences of old longline permits during that period: s 27(1)(d) (set history was not incorporated in the formula for calculating quota SFRs for people who held old minor line permits). Mr Kennedy held an old longline permit. The relevant sequences of permits are therefore sequences of old longline permits. The Panel determined that Mr Kennedy had suffered serious misfortune within the meaning of s 27. In those circumstances, section 27(1) provides that ""AFMA may"" perform the calculations in s 26 by using the average catch of the relevant species under all sequences of longline permits (s 27(1)(c)) and the average number of times a longline was set under all sequences of longline permits (s 27(1)(d)) in calculating the number of SFRs to be granted to Mr Kennedy under s 26. Finally, it was held in Palme that the appropriate remedy, in the event that a tribunal fails to satisfy a statutory obligation to provide adequate reasons for a decision, is an order in the nature of mandamus: at 224. That remedy can, and should, be sought independently of any rights of appeal such as those provided for in s 161 of the Act. The right of appeal, given by s 161, is confined by the requirement that the appeal be on a question of law from the decision of the Panel. The question must, therefore, be one which arises from the decision and not from any failure, on the part of the Panel, to satisfy its statutory obligations under s 160(1) of the Act. Such a failure, in my view, does not give rise to a question of law relating to the decision itself. Question of law 2(c) asked whether the Panel had complied with the obligations imposed on it by s 160(1)(b) of the Act. A negative answer to that question would not, however, have revealed any error affecting the Panel's decision: cf Birdseye at 326 (per Branson and Stone JJ). It could not, therefore, have assisted Mr Kennedy."
Case585,referred to,Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329,"Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 337 Perram J, without expressing a concluded view, said that there was ""much to be said"" for the views of Finkelstein J in Lees . His Honour suggested two additional considerations which supported Finkelstein J's reasons for doubting the correctness of the decision in Dornan . These additional considerations were: ""First, the reasons which attend an administrative decision are conceptually distinct from that decision and it is the decision, and not the reasons which accompany it, which is the subject of judicial review or, as here, appeal under s 44. The reasons have no legal consequences in themselves. Rather, they provide material from which arguments about the correctness of the decision may be crafted. Their legal relevance is, therefore, derivative from the decision to which they are appurtenant. ... ... Second, once the derivative nature is understood it must follow that the legal requirements attending the production of reasons need have no necessary connexion with the legal requirements attending the decision. A decision accompanied by perfectly adequate reasons may be riddled with legal errors just as a decision which is accompanied by inadequate reasons may be legal impeccable. The fallacy in the view that the provision of inadequate reasons is an error of law in the decision springs from the conflation of rules concerned with the making of the decision itself with rules concerned with the provision of reasons, a conflation which is, in my opinion, wholly without warrant. This is not to say that questions of law do not arise from the operation of rules about the provision of reasons. It is only to say that such questions arise dehors the decision and cannot be errors in the decision itself"": at 337-8. There is no reference, in the Full Court's reasons, to either of the High Court's decisions in Yusuf and Palme . Given that it was common ground that, in giving inadequate reasons, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law, I assume that the Court's attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that, in the primary judge's reasons, His Honour observed, referring to Yusuf , that ""it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional"": see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 345. Whilst it may be accepted that the failure, on the part of a decision maker, to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision. That position does not change simply because the decision-maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons. That circumstance does not, in my respectful opinion, render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside."
Case586,applied,Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137,"already noted there is authority to support an affirmative answer to this question. It is to be found in the Victorian Supreme Court's decision in the State Electricity Commission case. Authority is also to be found in decisions of this Court. In Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 , a Full Court held that a failure to give adequate reasons constitutes an error of law justifying the setting aside of an administrative decision. See also Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 62 FCR 402 ; Preston v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2004) 39 AAR 177 at 184; Hill v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 832 ; (2004) 207 ALR 470 at 474; and, most recently, Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137. These were cases in which the tribunal concerned had produced cryptic and uninformative reasons such that the reviewing court could not discern why it was that the tribunal had reached the impugned decision. In particular it was not possible to determine whether the correct legal principles had been applied. In Dornan , the Full Court drew on authorities such as Pettitt v Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376 in which appellate courts had found that trial judges erred in law if they failed to provide reasons or sufficient reasons thereby depriving the appeal court of the capacity to determine whether a verdict had been reached in accordance with law. In Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137 , the Full Court was concerned with an appeal, under s 44 of the AAT Act, from a decision of the Tribunal to set aside a decision of the Authority to cancel a certificate of approval. Both parties to the appeal accepted that the Tribunal had failed to satisfy the obligation, imposed on it, by s 43(2) of the AAT Act, to provide adequate reasons for its decision. It was common ground that such a failure constituted a ""question of law"" for the purposes of s 44(1) of the AAT Act. The Full Court said (at [42] - [43]) that: ""In circumstances such as the present, where it is common ground that there is a statutory entitlement to reasons and where such reasons have not been provided and cannot now be provided by the Tribunal member who made the decision, it is inevitable that the decision itself must be set aside. The primary judge correctly concluded that there had been non-compliance with s 43(2) and ordered that reasons now be provided by the original decision-maker. Compliance with that order is no longer possible. Because of the accepted failure to comply with s 43(2), the Tribunal decision must be set aside and the matter remitted for a new hearing in the Tribunal""."

Case588,considered,Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647,"approach did not enjoy universal acceptance. In Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647 at 656-9, Finkelstein J reviewed the authorities which commenced with Dornan and concluded that, were he not bound by these decisions, he would not follow them. He drew attention to conflicting decisions, including that of Brennan J in Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 445-6 and the English Divisional Court in Mountview Court Properties Ltd v Devlin (1970) 21 P &amp; CR 689. He considered it to be inappropriate to draw on cases in which appellate courts found reasons to be inadequate because, in such cases, no remedies such as a statutory order in the nature of mandamus were available to require the relevant trial judges to rectify the deficiencies in their reasons. His Honour also noted that, in the appellate context, the appellable error was founded on common law doctrine rather than on the construction of a statutory obligation to provide reasons. One might add that there is no compelling reason for treating a decision as errant solely because no reasons or no adequate reasons have been advanced to support it, unless one was attracted to Lord Denning's notion that, if a decision-maker fails to give reasons for a decision, a reviewing court could infer that he did not have any good reasons: see Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] UKHL 1 ; [1968] AC 997 at 1007.

Case594,cited,Hill v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 832 ; (2004) 207 ALR 470,"already noted there is authority to support an affirmative answer to this question. It is to be found in the Victorian Supreme Court's decision in the State Electricity Commission case. Authority is also to be found in decisions of this Court. In Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 , a Full Court held that a failure to give adequate reasons constitutes an error of law justifying the setting aside of an administrative decision. See also Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 62 FCR 402 ; Preston v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2004) 39 AAR 177 at 184; Hill v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 832 ; (2004) 207 ALR 470 at 474; and, most recently, Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137. These were cases in which the tribunal concerned had produced cryptic and uninformative reasons such that the reviewing court could not discern why it was that the tribunal had reached the impugned decision. In particular it was not possible to determine whether the correct legal principles had been applied. In Dornan , the Full Court drew on authorities such as Pettitt v Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376 in which appellate courts had found that trial judges erred in law if they failed to provide reasons or sufficient reasons thereby depriving the appeal court of the capacity to determine whether a verdict had been reached in accordance with law. The Full Court referred to Dornan and noted that, in Lees , Finkelstein J had acknowledged that he was bound to follow Dornan . It referred to Preston and Hill as authority for the proposition that a ""failure to state reasons for a decision at least in those circumstances where a statement of reasons is a requirement of the exercise of the decision-making process constitutes an error of law"": at [49]."

The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 253-7.

Case601,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teo (1995) 57 FCR 194,"Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teo (1995) 57 FCR 194 a Full Court was called on to construe various provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the Migration Regulations 1989 (Cth). It said (at 206): "" The construction of the regulations is to be approached by looking first to the statutory power in exercise of which they were made . As we have indicated, that is found in s 33 of the Act. This provides that the regulations may make provision that a person is entitled to be granted an entry permit of a particular class if the person satisfies all the prescribed criteria in relation to that class (s 33 (2)(b)). The power is expressed as being ""subject to sections 40 and 45"". Section 40 empowers the Minister to determine that the processing of entry permit applications of a specified class which have been made by persons who have entered and remained in Australia is to stop until a day specified in the notice given by him. Section 45 provides that an entry permit shall not be granted to certain deportees where an amount is still payable by them to the Commonwealth under s 65 or s 66. Section 65 deals with the costs of deportation, and s 66 with the costs of keeping deportees in custody. Further, s 34 imposes upon the Minister an obligation, where the relevant jurisdictional pre-condition is established, either to grant or refuse an entry permit. Judicial review of decisions of the Tribunal is confined by s 138 to an ""appeal"" which is ""on a question of law"". The result, if the statute and the regulations are taken as a whole, is to disclose a compromise which represents a balance between various competing interests which are involved. The particular pattern which is set in this way is not to be distorted by treating one element in it other than in accordance with the fair meaning allowed by the language which has been used. There is no reason to give a ""broad and generous construction"" to reg 131A. To do so may detract from the force given in the balance of the legislative scheme to the other interests which are involved. These include the view taken by other branches of government and reflected in the legislative text, being the statute and the regulations, of the social and material interests of the country as a whole in relation to the entry and settlement of aliens, and of the conditions which should be attached to permission to enter and stay in Australia: Robtelmes v Brenan [1906] HCA 58 ; (1906) 4 CLR 395 at 400; Pochi v MacPhee [1982] HCA 60 ; (1982) 151 CLR 101 at 106"" (emphasis added). It may be accepted that a purpose of s 27 is to ameliorate the effect of serious misfortune on past catch and activity rates. Section 26 allows an eligible person to rely on his or her best 2 years' catches between 1997 and 2001 (inclusive). Section 27 must, therefore, seek to compensate for more than the vicissitudes of commercial fishing which are acknowledged by this part of the formula. The purpose of s 27 is not to maximise the possible benefit for an individual operator. Nor is it to put the operator in the position he or she would have been in but for the serious misfortune. That is simply not possible. The objects of ss 26 and 27 are advanced on the construction contended for by AFMA, notwithstanding that it is not the construction most advantageous to Mr Kennedy's financial interests. In my view, there is nothing in s 27 that supports Mr Kennedy's submission that the phrase ""all sequences"" in ss 27(1)(c) and (d) should be read as excluding inactive permits. It is true that s 27(1)(c) refers to ""all sequences of that kind (old longline or old minor line, as the case may be)"" which requires the person performing the calculation to limit the sequences to either old longline sequences or old minor line sequences. There is, however, nothing in s 27 which justifies further limiting ""all sequences of that kind"" to old longline sequences that were active during the period of serious misfortune. Sections 26 and 27, prescribe, with a high degree of specificity, how the grants of quota SFRs are to be calculated when a person has suffered serious misfortune. Section 27 could expressly have limited the permits that were to be included in the ""average catch"" and the ""average number of times a longline was set"" to those permits that had been used during the applicant's period of serious misfortune. It did not do so."
Case602,considered,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323,"issue was considered by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323. In that case the Court dealt with a submission that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal should be set aside because the Tribunal had failed to comply with its obligations under s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to provide adequate reasons for coming to the decision. The argument was that the failure of the Tribunal to have regard to certain matters which had been pressed before it rendered its reasons inadequate with the consequence that, on this ground, its decision was a nullity. The Court rejected this argument. Gleeson CJ (at 330) was prepared to accept that, if a decision maker fails to make a finding on some question of fact in the course of giving reasons ""that will indicate that it made no finding on that matter; and that, in turn, may indicate that the Tribunal did not consider the matter to be material"". The absence of findings on a particular matter may be indicative of error but the failure to refer, in the course of giving reasons, to findings which were not made does not itself constitute reviewable error: ""It is impossible to read the expression ""the findings"" as meaning anything other than the findings which the Tribunal has made . By setting out its findings, and thereby exposing its views on materiality, the Tribunal may disclose a failure to exercise jurisdiction, or error ... or may provide some other ground for judicial review...But all the tribunal is obliged to set out is such findings as it has made ..."": at 331-2 (emphasis added). Other members of the Court made similar observations: see per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 346, 349 and 351. The issue was further considered by the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212. In Palme the Court held that a failure to discharge the statutory obligation imposed by s 501G of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) , to give reasons for a decision to cancel a visa, did not mean that the decision could be set aside because it was tainted with jurisdictional error. Four aspects of the reasoning in Palme are of present relevance. First, it is necessary to recognise that a distinction is to be drawn between the decision and the reasons for that decision: see Palme at 225. An attack on the reasons which seeks to have the decision set aside fails to appreciate this distinction. This is a different attack from one which focuses on a jurisdictional error arising from the failure of the reasons to refer to, for example, a relevant consideration: cf Yusuf at 351-2. There is no reference, in the Full Court's reasons, to either of the High Court's decisions in Yusuf and Palme . Given that it was common ground that, in giving inadequate reasons, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law, I assume that the Court's attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that, in the primary judge's reasons, His Honour observed, referring to Yusuf , that ""it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional"": see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 345. Whilst it may be accepted that the failure, on the part of a decision maker, to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision. That position does not change simply because the decision-maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons. That circumstance does not, in my respectful opinion, render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside."
Case603,applied,"Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme, Re [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212","issue was further considered by the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212. In Palme the Court held that a failure to discharge the statutory obligation imposed by s 501G of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) , to give reasons for a decision to cancel a visa, did not mean that the decision could be set aside because it was tainted with jurisdictional error. Four aspects of the reasoning in Palme are of present relevance. First, it is necessary to recognise that a distinction is to be drawn between the decision and the reasons for that decision: see Palme at 225. An attack on the reasons which seeks to have the decision set aside fails to appreciate this distinction. This is a different attack from one which focuses on a jurisdictional error arising from the failure of the reasons to refer to, for example, a relevant consideration: cf Yusuf at 351-2. Secondly, it is important to identify precisely what act is being impugned: Palme at 225. In Palme there was an attack by Constitutional writ on the exercise of the power to cancel a visa. In this case, there is an appeal from the Panel's decision to set aside AFMA's decision and substitute one more favourable to Mr Kennedy because it was not sufficiently favourable to his interests. The word ""decision"" in this context means the final and operative decision of the Panel as provided for in s 150(3) of the Act: Director-General of Social Services v Chaney [1980] FCA 87 ; (1980) 47 FLR 80. Section 161 fixes on the decision as the subject matter of the appeal, not on the reasons. Thirdly, the question of whether a failure to comply with a statutory requirement to provide adequate reasons can affect the exercise of power is one of statutory construction: Palme at 225. There is nothing in the scheme of the legislation which suggests that the provision of inadequate reasons could vitiate a decision of the Panel. On the contrary, given the nature of the Panel's task, the requirement that all operators be parties to the appeal to the Panel (s 144(3) of the Act) and the fact that the allocation of SFRs cannot be implemented until after any application to the Panel is dealt with (s 23(3) of the Act), it could not readily be inferred that the Act intended that a failure to give reasons should invalidate the decision. Finally, it was held in Palme that the appropriate remedy, in the event that a tribunal fails to satisfy a statutory obligation to provide adequate reasons for a decision, is an order in the nature of mandamus: at 224. That remedy can, and should, be sought independently of any rights of appeal such as those provided for in s 161 of the Act. The right of appeal, given by s 161, is confined by the requirement that the appeal be on a question of law from the decision of the Panel. The question must, therefore, be one which arises from the decision and not from any failure, on the part of the Panel, to satisfy its statutory obligations under s 160(1) of the Act. Such a failure, in my view, does not give rise to a question of law relating to the decision itself. Question of law 2(c) asked whether the Panel had complied with the obligations imposed on it by s 160(1)(b) of the Act. A negative answer to that question would not, however, have revealed any error affecting the Panel's decision: cf Birdseye at 326 (per Branson and Stone JJ). It could not, therefore, have assisted Mr Kennedy. Mr Kennedy submitted that Palme may be distinguished on the basis that there is no equivalent of s 501G(4) of the Migration Act in the Act. Where a decision has been made to refuse to grant a visa to a person or to cancel a visa, s 501G of the Migration Act requires the Minister to give the person a written notice which sets out the decision and the reasons for the decision. Section 501G(4) provides: ""A failure to comply with this section in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision"". The relevant parts of the reasoning in Palme do not, however, depend on s 501G(4). As already noted, the Court emphasised the need to distinguish between a decision which is sought to be challenged and the reasons for that decision when determining whether the decision can be impeached for jurisdictional error. In their joint judgment (at 221) Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ said: ""The visa cancellation decision may be reviewed in this court for jurisdictional error. Such error may be found from what is disclosed by reasons provided under s 501G(1)(e). Failure to provide reasons may also be reviewed in this Court and compliance by the Minister with the statutory duty may be ordered. The reasons then provided may furnish grounds for prohibition under s 75(v) [of the Constitution ] in respect of the visa cancellation decision. But what is not provided for is for a prosecutor, as in this case, to bypass that earlier step utilising mandamus, and to impeach the visa cancellation decision itself for want of discharge of the duty to provide reasons. There is, as was pointed out in argument, a critical distinction between failure to comply with s 501G(1)(e) and using that failure to conclude that the visa cancellation decision is flawed by jurisdictional error"". See also at 227-228 (per McHugh J). It was open to Mr Kennedy to seek an order of mandamus to compel the Panel to comply with its obligations under s 160(1) of the Act. He did not do so. Instead, he has proceeded to prosecute his appeal to this Court on the basis of the reasons which he, rightly, submits are inadequate. His failure to seek a mandatory order may have been the result of a forensic decision (cf Palme at 224) or for some other reason. Whatever the reason, the inadequacy of the Panel's reasons cannot, consistently with the decision in Palme , be relied on to impeach the Panel's decision. There is no reference, in the Full Court's reasons, to either of the High Court's decisions in Yusuf and Palme . Given that it was common ground that, in giving inadequate reasons, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law, I assume that the Court's attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that, in the primary judge's reasons, His Honour observed, referring to Yusuf , that ""it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional"": see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 345. Whilst it may be accepted that the failure, on the part of a decision maker, to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision. That position does not change simply because the decision-maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons. That circumstance does not, in my respectful opinion, render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside. In my opinion, I am bound by Palme to hold that the Panel's failure to comply with its obligations under s 160(1)(b) of the Act does not constitute a jurisdictional error which would warrant the setting aside of the Panel's decision."
Case604,referred to,Mountview Court Properties Ltd v Devlin (1970) 21 P &amp; CR 689,"approach did not enjoy universal acceptance. In Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647 at 656-9, Finkelstein J reviewed the authorities which commenced with Dornan and concluded that, were he not bound by these decisions, he would not follow them. He drew attention to conflicting decisions, including that of Brennan J in Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 445-6 and the English Divisional Court in Mountview Court Properties Ltd v Devlin (1970) 21 P &amp; CR 689. He considered it to be inappropriate to draw on cases in which appellate courts found reasons to be inadequate because, in such cases, no remedies such as a statutory order in the nature of mandamus were available to require the relevant trial judges to rectify the deficiencies in their reasons. His Honour also noted that, in the appellate context, the appellable error was founded on common law doctrine rather than on the construction of a statutory obligation to provide reasons. One might add that there is no compelling reason for treating a decision as errant solely because no reasons or no adequate reasons have been advanced to support it, unless one was attracted to Lord Denning's notion that, if a decision-maker fails to give reasons for a decision, a reviewing court could infer that he did not have any good reasons: see Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] UKHL 1 ; [1968] AC 997 at 1007."
Case605,referred to,Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 62 FCR 402,"already noted there is authority to support an affirmative answer to this question. It is to be found in the Victorian Supreme Court's decision in the State Electricity Commission case. Authority is also to be found in decisions of this Court. In Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 , a Full Court held that a failure to give adequate reasons constitutes an error of law justifying the setting aside of an administrative decision. See also Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 62 FCR 402 ; Preston v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2004) 39 AAR 177 at 184; Hill v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 832 ; (2004) 207 ALR 470 at 474; and, most recently, Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137. These were cases in which the tribunal concerned had produced cryptic and uninformative reasons such that the reviewing court could not discern why it was that the tribunal had reached the impugned decision.

Case610,cited,State Electricity Commission v Commissioner for Equal Opportunity [1992] 1 VR 79,"2(c) in the notice of appeal asks whether the Panel had complied with the obligation imposed upon it by s 160(1)(b) of the Act. Section 160(1)(b) requires the Panel to prepare a written statement setting out the reasons for its decisions. Mr Kennedy complains that first, the Panel made a bald finding on his claim for serious misfortune; second that it did not provide reasons for preferring AFMA's construction of s 27 to that advanced by him; and third that the Panel did not provide reasons as to how it reached its conclusion that he suffered serious misfortune only during the February - November 1998 and July 1999 - April 2000 periods. Mr Kennedy submits that a party is entitled to know why he won or lost. A reading of the Panel's reasons would, it was submitted, leave the fair-minded reader none the wiser as to why he was only partially successful. He relied on the decision of Gobbo J in State Electricity Commission v Commissioner for Equal Opportunity [1992] 1 VR 79 in which his Honour held (at 88) that reasons for decision which fail to disclose the process of reasoning of the decision maker are ""defective and show error of law on the face of the record"". There can, in my view, be no doubt that the Panel has failed to comply with the requirements of s 160(1)(b) that it ""prepare a written statement ... setting out the reasons for [its] decision"". Were it not for another statutory provision, to which I will shortly refer, it might readily be argued that the Panel has complied with this obligation. It has produced a document of some 20 pages which contains 86 paragraphs which it has published as its reasons for its decision on Mr Kennedy's appeal. The question remains, however, whether the published reasons are sufficiently detailed to meet the obligation imposed by s 160(1)(b). Section 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) provides that, where another Act requires that a Tribunal give written reasons for its decisions ""the instrument giving the reasons shall also set out the findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based"". As already noted there is authority to support an affirmative answer to this question. It is to be found in the Victorian Supreme Court's decision in the State Electricity Commission case. Authority is also to be found in decisions of this Court. In Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 , a Full Court held that a failure to give adequate reasons constitutes an error of law justifying the setting aside of an administrative decision.

No order was sought by Mr Kennedy, in the course of the present appeal, requiring the Panel to provide reasons which satisfied its statutory obligations. This decision was, no doubt, influenced, in part at least, by the fact that one of the two members of the Panel who made the decision (Mr Baston) is no longer a Panel member. Had a mandatory order been made, the Panel probably could not have complied with it because the reasons given must be those of the decision-makers and not their successors: cf State Electricity Commission at 86.

Case612,cited,TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175,"161 of the Act, like s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (""the AAT Act""), allows an appeal to this Court only on a question of law. The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground an appeal under s 44, but is also the subject matter of the appeal itself: see TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 per Gummow J. The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 253-7.

It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that, in our view, one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal"" (emphasis added)."
Case613,referred to,"United Firefighters Union, Re (1969) 129 CAR 43","Kennedy contended that s 27 makes remedial provision for an eligible person who has been disadvantaged by having suffered a serious misfortune.

Case614,referred to,Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones [1980] AC 74,"contended that the plain language of s 27 requires the average of "" all sequences of permits to be used"". It submitted that the word ""all"" is to be given work to do and the language does not allow or permit a construction that means less than the total number of permits. The ordinary meaning of the word ""all"" is ""the whole amount, quantity or extent of"". It does not mean less than the total. It does not admit of the construction advanced by Mr Kennedy that only a subset of the permits, those that were ""active"" in a certain period, should be used to calculate the average. Mr Kennedy had invited the Court to read words into s 27 such that only ""active"" permits were to be taken into consideration. In such circumstances, it must be possible for the Court to state with certainty what the additional words were that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by Parliament, had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law: see Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones [1980] AC 74 at 105. To seek to qualify the word ""all"" by the word ""active"" introduces ambiguity. The word ""active"" is not defined in the Management Plan. AFMA submitted that Mr Kennedy proceeded on an assumption that the Management Plan evinces an intention to maximise the allocation for those who consider themselves active fishers. Such an assumption is inconsistent with the language of the provisions, the portion of the formula which is based on permit value and with a choice of a particular qualifying period. AFMA rejected the significance which Mr Kennedy attached to the words ""catch"" and ""set"". Catch describes the product of fishing, rather than the activity of fishing. The words ""catch"" and ""set"" do not assist in limiting the class of permit-holders in ""all sequences of that kind"". The construction advanced by Mr Kennedy also ignored the definitions of ""old longline permit"" in s 20 of the Management Plan, which does not focus on activity under the permits, but the instrument which authorises fishing. The context and purpose of s 27 favour the construction advanced by AFMA which was accepted, without elaboration, by the Panel. Section 27 must be read in the context of the Management Plan as a whole. The Management Plan reflects policy choices on the allocation of commercial fishing rights, in relation to a finite resource. These choices are embodied in the formula in s 26. The phrase ""all sequences of that kind"" must be construed in this context."

Case620,cited,Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378,"Payne noted Mrs Bogdan's evidence that her father-in-law produced the draft plan and ultimately the plan was taken to Igor Designs for a final plan to be prepared. Magistrate Payne noted that Mr Bogdan did not give evidence and this was unhelpful as he was, according to Mrs Bogdan's evidence, one of the persons who drew up the plan. Magistrate Payne found it unhelpful that no evidence was called from anyone from Igor Designs. Her Honour referred to ss 10 , 14 , 31 and 36 of the Copyright Act and placed reliance upon paras [38], [41], [42], [44], [49] and [55] of the reasons for judgment of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378 (Moore J agreeing). Magistrate Payne noted those paragraphs as they contain a statement of principles that, in her Honour's view, governed the resolution of the case. At those paragraphs, Wilcox and Lindgren JJ note these principles. Magistrate Payne also referred to [111] of the reasons for judgment of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood in which their Honours said this: If there is to be a finding of reproduction of a substantial part of a work, the substantial part should be identified . His Honour referred to ""the overall design and combination of features"" but gives no further detail . His Honour did not attempt to identify any part of the Baltimore as being a qualitatively substantial part of the Baltimore in the sense discussed at [47] [56] above. With respect we think his Honour erred in this regard. Likewise, ""striking similarity"", without more , does not necessarily mean that there has been a reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the plan of a project home. The similarity referred to may have been that of common ideas . [emphasis added] Her Honour then applied those principles to the evidence before noting that a plan for a project home is partly functional reflecting ""reasonable proximities"" that would not be a ""substantial part"" of a house plan regarded as an artistic work. Her Honour made this finding at p 10 of her reasons: If seen in isolation, a comparison of the Bogdan plan and the Jennings Cortona and Verona plans shows there are striking similarities. Taking up the notion of a requirement on the part of Jennings, in order to discharge its onus, to show more than striking similarities, so as to establish reproduction of the work either as to the whole work or as to a substantial part, Magistrate Payne said this: The footprint of the Bogdan plan and the AV Jennings Cortona plan are similar, although there are differences. There is also similarity between the Bogdan plan and the AV Jennings Verona plan, and again there are differences, and I say this noting that the Bogdan plan was a mirror reverse of the AV Jennings plans. There is a similarity between the arrangement of the rooms and the footprint of the buildings, although all three are different from each other in some respects. These differences include a different floor plan and different roof line. However, it is not the footprint or floor plan alone the plaintiff complains of. The plaintiff says it is the footprint with the original or distinguishing feature of displayed walls and the higher ceilings. [emphasis added] Magistrate Payne then expressed the view set out in para 2 quoted below, which resonates with the reservation expressed by Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in the last sentence of [111] in Tamawood : I note also that Mr and Mrs Bogdan did little to assist me other than to say that Mrs Bogdan in her evidence had never heard of AV Jennings and had never seen one of their plans and she said she had not seen one of their homes until she was contacted by AV Jennings. ... However, despite this little assistance the onus rests on the plaintiff in this matter. When considering all of those similarities and dissimilarities which I have done and then, in applying the law, I do not consider that the plaintiff has discharged its burden of proof. I find that the displayed walls and raised ceiling to be that of a common idea and not sufficient to sustain a conclusion of reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the AV Jennings Verona plan or Cortona plan by either or both of the first or second defendant. [emphasis added] Consideration of the issues on appeal As to subconscious copying, Willmer LJ noted in Francis Day &amp; Hunter at p 613 that, ""if subconscious copying is to be found, there must be proof (or at least a strong inference) of de facto familiarity with the work alleged to be copied"". In the absence of any direct evidence of use of or access to the Jennings plan in suit, the causal link can be established by inference. The greater the degree of objective similarity between the two plans, the more likely it is that an inference of actual use might be drawn ( S W Hart &amp; Co (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 472; Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309 per Heerey, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ). Exact copying is rarely the conduct in controversy. Normally an inference is sought to be drawn in the face of quantitative features of the plan in suit, present in the plan under challenge, or by correspondence with a substantial part qualitatively of the plaintiff's plan, or both. If the contention is that a substantial part of the plan in suit has been taken, a question of ""fact and degree"" arises ( Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 per Weinberg J at [71]) and the ""protected element may arise out of a combination of elements, any one of which considered individually might not qualify as sufficiently original to attract copyright"" ( Inform Design , per Weinberg J at [71] [emphasis added]). An allegation of substantial reproduction of the work by reproduction of a substantial part will be made out if what is taken is an essential or material part of the work in suit. The phrase ""substantial part"" refers to the quality of that taken and the importance it bears to the work as a whole ( Tamawood v Henley Arch at [50], [52] and [54]; Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall 18 IPR 490 at 494 per Lockhart, Spender and Ryan JJ; Autodesk Inc. v Dyason [No. 2] [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 per Mason CJ at 305). It may be that a particular orientation and layout of rooms which draws a user through a structure in a particular way is an essential or material part of a plan ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 161 ALR 503 at [74] ). Essentiality is a question of fact and degree. In Tamawood at [111], Wilcox and Lindgren JJ (Moore J agreeing) noted that striking similarities however may not be enough in circumstances where the plaintiff has failed to identify the ""substantial part"" reproduced and has put its case on the footing of the ""overall design and combination of features but gives no further detail "". In such circumstances, their Honours noted that substantial similarities may simply be referable to ""common ideas"". Magistrate Payne found that splayed walls and raised ceilings are a ""common idea"" and not sufficient to sustain a conclusion of reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of either the Verona plan or the Cortona plan by either respondent. The evidence before Magistrate Payne did not establish the notion that angled walls are a common idea. It is true that the Jennings plans, the Bogdan plan and the Dixon plan exhibit elevated ceilings. However, the conclusion reached by Magistrate Payne did not take into account the particular combination of features reflected at [61] to [65] of these reasons, the evidence of Mr Deshon concerning the evolution of the Bogdan plan as a contended progression from the Canberra plan and the evidence in relation to the features of Annexure C (that is, the elements of [61] to [69]). The evidence that supports the conclusion of striking similarities based upon the identified combination of precise features makes it clear that the combination cannot be described as commonplace or simply a common idea. Taken separately, the notion of elevated ceilings may not suggest actual use of a Jennings plan. The adoption, by itself, of angled walls at 15 degrees ""off the right angled rib"" might not be sufficient to suggest actual use although the evidence suggests that such a feature is an essential or material feature. The combination of those two features adds incremental weight to the notion of objective similarity suggesting use. The combination of those features together with a floor plan exhibiting substantial similarity in orientation and layout of rooms further supports an inference of use. The expert evidence casting doubt on the proffered explanation of the origin of the Bogdan plan adds further weight to the inference as does Mr Deshon's evidence that the magazine photograph (Exhibit 6) would not lead him to a design of elevated flat ceilings had the photograph been produced to him as a starting point for a design of the rooms and ceilings in a new house, reflecting the design depicted in the photograph. Accordingly, her Honour in reaching the finding as to a ""common idea"" did not take into account all of the evidence. Moreover, the notion that something more must be shown is put in proper context by their Honours in Tamawood . As their Honours noted, that case concerned circumstances where the plaintiff had failed to identify the substantial part said to be reproduced and had put its case on the basis of overall design and a combination of features in circumstances where no detail had been given. That is not this case. It follows therefore that the evidence supports an inference that the Bogdan plan evolved through the use of either of the Jennings Verona 245 plan, the Cortona 245 or the Cortona 290 (as the embodiment of the combination of features identified and relied upon by the appellant). The question that remains is whether the evidence supports an inference of actual use by either or both of the respondents. Mrs Bogdan gave the evidence described earlier in these reasons which led to a finding of fact and a finding of credit ([50] of these reasons) in her favour. Magistrate Payne accepted her evidence entirely and especially her evidence that she had not seen a Jennings plan and did not have any knowledge that the Bogdan plan was a copy of any Jennings plan. That finding was plainly open on the evidence and counsel for Jennings accepted that such a finding was open to her Honour. It follows therefore that Mrs Bogdan did not make actual use of any Jennings plan in either formulating her ideas or contributing those ideas to her husband and/or Mr Florien Bogdan and there is no basis for disturbing those findings. However, the evidence of Mrs Bogdan makes it plain that Mr Bogdan was an author of Annexure C to Exhibit 4 and contributed together with Mr Florien Bogdan to the draft drawings. Mr Florien Bogdan produced Annexure D1 which was given to Igor Designs to produce Annexure E. Mr Bogdan, by his submissions, says that it is apparent from the transcript that he made statements throughout the proceeding that illustrate the nature of the evidence he would have given had Magistrate Payne made it plain to him that an adverse inference might arise should he not give evidence and those statements are set out at pp 26, 33, 35, 36, 62, 74 to 76 and 84 and 85 of the transcript. However, even if an assumption is made that the statements at those pages of the transcript ought to be treated as, in effect, oral evidence, the statements do not answer the conclusion open on the totality of the evidence that authors of the Bogdan plan used either the Verona 245 plan, the Cortona 245 plan or the Cortona 290 plan (as the embodiment in final form of the features in those plans and the plan in suit) in bringing into existence the Bogdan plan with its combination of features evident in the Cortona 290 plan. It may be that an inference is open that either Mr Bogdan used a Jennings plan and reproduced the combined features relied upon by the appellant or alternatively, Mr Florien Bogdan did so. Alternatively, an inference might be found that both men so used the plan. It seems likely as a matter of inference from all the evidence and particularly that of Mrs Bogdan, that Mr Florien Bogdan as a carpenter who had previously built eight houses, used a Jennings plan and thus reproduced the combined features relied upon by the appellant. However, the evidence of Mrs Bogdan makes it plain that Mr Bogdan was responsible for Annexure C and was a contributory author to the drawings (see [44] to [48] of these reasons). Mrs Bogdan referred to eight drawings in all in the evolution of the Bogdan plan, although only those drawings annexed to Exhibit 4 were produced in evidence. It follows, that Magistrate Payne erred by failing to find use of the appellant's work and reproduction in a material form of that work in suit, as against the respondent, Mr Tiberiu Bogdan. It follows that the order of the Court below dismissing the appellant's claim against Mr Tiberiu Bogdan is to be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff below. The second question that arises is the assessment of damages. The Court below did not assess nor make findings as to the quantum of the plaintiff's damage. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court to do so. Damages"

Whether there has been infringement of the whole requires that the originality of the part taken be considered in relation to the work as a whole. The question is whether the part is an ""essential or material"" feature of the whole. There is no doubt that Jennings bears the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the respondents made actual use of the work in suit and having used the work, they brought into existence a plan that either takes a substantial part of the plan in suit, shown to be an essential or material feature of the whole (although perhaps a quantitatively small part) or takes substantially the whole plan, viewed quantitatively, assuming that an exact copy of the plan in suit has not been made. As to the last matter, no such claim is made. In this case, actual use is sought to be established as an inference arising out of contended striking similarities between the two plans. Those striking similarities then speak to reproduction of the plan in suit and thus infringement. In Francis Day &amp; Hunter Ltd v Bron , Willmer LJ at p 614 noted, apart from the observations mentioned at [54] of these reasons, these further matters: (3) Where there is a substantial degree of objective similarity, this of itself will afford prima facie evidence to show that there is a causal connection between the plaintiffs' and the defendants' work; at least it is a circumstance from which the inference may be drawn. (4) The fact that the defendant denies that he consciously copied affords some evidence to rebut the inference of causal connection arising from the objective similarity, but is in no way conclusive.

Case628,cited,New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore [1998] FCA 345,"Bogdan says that if the respondents had agreed to pay a licence fee to Jennings of $20,000.00, it would follow that Jennings would have no claim for the construction profit as the respondents would not have engaged Jennings to do the work. Mrs Bogdan says that conversely, if an assumption is made that Jennings would have been engaged to construct the respondents' house, there would be no licence fee. More fundamentally, Mrs Bogdan says that Jennings has not suffered any loss of profit based on construction because ""we weren't intending to hire A V Jennings to build our house"". Mrs Bogdan said that she had obtained advice from lawyers who advised her that on the authority of New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore [1998] FCA 345 , per Burchett J, the appropriate fee for use of a project home drawing was found to be $750.00 and that the case is authority for the proposition that no claim for loss of profit can be sustained in the face of evidence that the infringing respondent would not have engaged the plaintiff to construct the home. Mrs Bogdan says: This is exactly the case here. There is no evidence or even suggestion that the respondents would have engaged Jennings to construct the house in question and indeed such a claim is not even alleged in the statement of claim. More generally, Mrs Bogdan in making the point that the respondents are not project home builders or in the business of building houses, said this: ... to close, we say that we're not business. We're not intending to make business out of our home. We built it for us. We're not builders. We've got an owner/builder permit to do our own home. Mrs Bogdan referred to the authority of New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore (supra) and observations made by Burchett J. In that case, Burchett J considered a claim for compensatory damages in circumstances where, like this case, the respondent ""did not construct a house for sale, but as a home to live in"" (p 7). His Honour at p 8 referred to a number of authorities that support the proposition that the Court may adopt as a measure of damages where it thinks the course appropriate, a fair fee for the use of the plan the subject of the infringement. Burchett J noted that the applicant sought an assessment of damages on the basis of the profit it would have earned by the sale of a kit for the construction of the respondents' house. However, the evidence demonstrated that the respondent would never have purchased a kit home from the applicant ""under any circumstances"" and thus the infringement did not cause the loss of profit on the sale of a kit home. The applicant sought an assessment of damages on the basis of a licence fee of $6,000.00 for the use of the kit home construction plans. His Honour referred to evidence that suggested a licence fee based on a fee paid to a draftsman of $535.00 was a more likely fair licence fee and thus awarded the applicant damages of $750.00, as mentioned in submissions by Mrs Bogdan. In this case, it is equally clear that had Jennings quoted to the respondents an amount of $198,550.00 (including GST) as the price for the construction of the Bogdan home including the variations to the plan the subject of the amount of $16,424.00 mentioned in the evidence of Mr Henesey-Smith, the Bogdans would not have accepted that quote. Jennings would not have undertaken the project and would not have derived the construction profit or any profit. Accordingly, in assessing the damages on that footing, I take into account these matters. In this case, the respondents, like the respondent in New England Country Homes , chose to devise a plan for and then construct a home to live in rather than a house for sale. In doing so, Mr Bogdan engaged in conduct of reproducing the appellant's plan in a material form. There is no suggestion that either respondent will engage in any further infringing conduct. Nor is there any evidence that Jennings has suffered a diminution in its revenue by reason of this transactional act of infringement. Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that Jennings would not have derived any profit from the project as the respondents would not have either paid a licence fee to or contracted with Jennings for the design and construction of their home. Nevertheless, the fact that the respondents would not have contracted with Jennings is not an answer to the Jennings' claim for damages suffered as a result of the infringement. It is necessary to formulate the damages referable to the act of infringement by attempting to disaggregate the bundle of services Jennings supplies to a client so as to isolate the best estimate of damages possible on the evidence available as a measure of the appellant's loss directly related to infringement. In undertaking that exercise, it is not appropriate to bring into account the cost of the additions to the Bogdan plan not reflected in the Cortona 290 . Jennings says that the direct cost of design and construction of a Cortona 290 in January 2004 was $118,912.00. A margin of 25% based on those foundation costs would amount to $29,728.00. Jennings, of course, says that its 25% margin is struck on the gross turnover value excluding GST which in respect of the Cortona 290 excluding the Bogdan additions seems to be $164,076.00 representing a margin of $41,019.00 on the preferred method adopted by Jennings. That method of calculating a margin on the turnover value excluding GST is a calculation of its design and construction profit. Damages ought not to be calculated on that footing. An examination of these approaches to the calculation of profit is simply an indication of the net loss Jennings might have derived had it undertaken the project (leaving aside the variations for this purpose). One way of forming a view of the contribution of the copyright in the plan to that profit is to appreciate the aggregation of services which give rise to the profit and to then disaggregate those services and apportion some part of the profit to the use of the plan as an analogue of loss suffered by Jennings by reason of the use by Mr Bogdan of the Jennings plan as joint author with Mr Florien Bogdan. The profit calculation is simply a base starting point. Doing the best I can on the available evidence which is very limited, I estimate the contribution of the copyright in the plan at about 10%. The vast majority of the profit is, no doubt, referable to the quantities of materials supplied and the construction, supervision and completion of the home itself. On that footing, the damages would range between $2,972.00 and $4,101.00. It seems to me that the appropriate amount is the average of the two namely, $3,536.00. There is no basis for an award of exemplary damages."

There is, understandably, no evidence of a discounted cash flow valuation of the copyright as a capital asset nor, equally understandably, any evidence of any diminution, by reason of the infringement, in the capacity of Jennings to derive revenue by exploiting the copyright work, that is, by using the plan and constructing houses representing a three-dimensional reproduction of the plan, for clients. In this case, the respondents built a single house as their residential dwelling. They are not project home builders and they are not in the business of repetitious infringing conduct.

Equally clearly, the element of disruption was the factual foundation upon which their Honours came to the conclusion that the applicants in each case would not have granted a licence. It is clear in this case that had a licence been sought by the respondents from Jennings it would either not have been granted or alternatively a licence fee of $20,000.00 might have been nominated by Jennings. That possibility is at least consistent with the letter of demand and the pleading.

The Federal Magistrate erred by refusing to contact witness and/or to advise or allow the Appellant of his right to call witness in circumstances where the evidence was readily available and was of critical importance. The grounds are substantially similar to those raised before the Federal Magistrate in relation to the Tribunal's decision. 4 Before Lloyd-Jones FM the appellant raised a number of particulars of the grounds relating to the conduct of the hearing before the Tribunal. The appellant argued that the Tribunal hearing and decision making process were inadequate in that he was not accorded procedural fairness or given a real and meaningful opportunity to represent himself. Further, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal member did not bring an impartial mind to the issues or that the member had a preconceived view (at [12]). Many of these claims were directed to the method of questioning and the adequacy of interpreting. Counsel for the appellant acknowledged there was an overlap between the particulars of the first and second grounds (at [12]). 5 His Honour had the benefit of extensive written submissions and the appellant was represented by counsel. After the hearing, Lloyd-Jones FM listened to the tapes of the Tribunal hearing and read the transcript (at [21], [25]). He considered in some detail the matters raised in the particulars and in the written and oral submissions and found that there had been no denial of procedural fairness nor any evidence to support a claim of apprehended bias (at [13]-[33]). 6 The appellant makes no submissions on those aspects of his Honour's reasons. I have reviewed those reasons for this finding and do not consider that his Honour erred. 7 The appellant also asserts that he had been ill at the time of the Tribunal hearing and suffered from depression in a way that affected his ability to participate in the hearing. There is evidence of a medical report before the Tribunal but that report does not mention a reduced ability of the appellant to attend and participate in the hearing. The appellant could not point to any other reference in the material before the Tribunal to suggest that the Tribunal should have been aware of the alleged state of his health. He said that he told his legal advisers but could point to no reference to the state of his health in any submissions to, or correspondence with, the Tribunal nor in the transcript of the hearing. I am not satisfied that there was any denial of procedural fairness on the part of the Tribunal in this regard. 8 The appellant says that the Tribunal did not believe him. That engages merits review which is not a matter for this Court. 9 The appellant asserts that the Tribunal failed to consider evidence that he submitted from Amnesty International. There is reference to that evidence in the Tribunal's decision and in the Federal Magistrate's reasons (at [32]). It is described by the Tribunal as providing a chronology of correspondence in relation to the appellant's case and evidence of his political profile and his family's profile as business people in danger of being targeted as class enemies by Maoists. The underlying facts of the appellant's personal position were accepted by the Tribunal. There is no basis for a finding of jurisdictional error in respect of this evidence."
Case644,cited,Patmore v Upton [2004] TASSC 77,of the Patmore contract was delayed by litigation over applications initiated by the respondent (on 6 June 2003) and Mr Patmore (on 19 December 2003) for the removal of Mr Upton's caveat. A contested hearing took place in the Supreme Court in March 2004 and on 27 July 2004 Underwood J delivered a judgment ordering that the caveat be removed: Patmore v Upton [2004] TASSC 77. On 6 August 2004 the contract between the respondent and Mr Patmore for the sale of the whole of the land was completed.
Case645,applied,Forsyth v Blundell [1973] HCA 20 ; (1973) 129 CLR 477,"exercising its power of sale the respondent was under a duty to act in good faith, and not to fraudulently, or wilfully or recklessly sacrifice the mortgage property. The taking of reasonable precautions to obtain a proper price is part of the duty to act in good faith: Forsyth v Blundell [1973] HCA 20 ; (1973) 129 CLR 477. I am satisfied that the respondent took all reasonable steps. The land was put up at a properly advertised auction, and then remained on the market for some 15 months, during which time it only attracted one offer, for which it was sold. I am satisfied that the price was a reasonable price, and in fact was at or about market value at the time. I reject valuation evidence given on behalf of Mr Upton by Mr Daryll Timms. He valued the land at 27 November 2000 at $175,000 ""for security purposes"" but on the basis that ""a six lot Council approved development would be completed by Mr Upton himself"". It is not quite clear what is meant by this last-mentioned basis. If it means that a hypothetical purchaser was to buy on the basis that Mr Upton himself, and nobody else, would carry out works at some unspecified price, it is quite unreal."
Case646,cited,Fountain Meat Sales Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401,"Sealy on behalf of the respondent sought an order for costs on an indemnity basis. He referred to a number of authorities, including Fountain Meat Sales Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401 where Woodward J said that such an order was appropriate where an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the party, properly advised, should have known that he had no chance of success. It is not necessary to show that the claim was brought for some collateral purpose or is an abuse of process. In my opinion this was a hopeless case, and should have been recognised as such from the outset. Given the initial auction and the time the property was on the market, there was no arguable basis for contending that the sale to Mr Patmore was improper. On that premise, the respondent could not have been expected to act other than in the way it did. At the heart of Mr Upton's case is, I suspect, a belief that notwithstanding he was a mortgagor in default he had some kind of right of first refusal before the mortgagee could sell. This is a misconception. There should be an award of indemnity costs.

Case649,discussed,Lott v JBW &amp; Friends Pty Ltd (2000) 76 SASR 105,"In dealing with this issue the learned Magistrate discussed Lott v JBW &amp; Friends Pty Ltd (2000) 76 SASR 105. The work there in question was a graphic bar with the words ""Opera in the Outback"". The report does not contain a reproduction. Mullighan J held that it was a ""drawing"". His Honour said at [14] The graphic designer had to create a design and make choices about the layout, font, colour and dimensions of each part of the design. Having perused the graphic ... I do not regard it as so simple as to deny copyright. ... The selection of the font from a computer program is no less creative than manual drawing ... 23 In the present case her Honour, correctly in my view, pointed out at [29] that Lott is not authority for the proposition that anything a graphic designer prepares is a drawing. 24 The same point was made by Mr Minahan, counsel for the respondents, in his written submissions. The submissions, he said, involved the use of a computer and selection of typeface and decisions about layout and presentation including headings and indentation. The same could be said for a newspaper. However neither the submissions nor a newspaper would be regarded as a drawing. 25 Her Honour adopted the statement in Ricketson, S The Law of Intellectual Property, Copyright Designs and Confidential Information , at par 7.365: Essentially, a drawing is a two-dimensional work in which shapes and images are depicted by lines, often without colouring. 26 I would agree that this is the ordinary meaning of the term ""drawing"". The Macquarie Dictionary gives us several definitions of the noun ""drawing"": ... 2. representation by lines; delineation of form without reference to colour. 3. a sketch, plan, or design, esp one made with pen, pencil, or crayon. 27 In the context of the visual arts, the traditional distinction has been between paintings, which are coloured, and drawings, which are monotone, usually, but not always, black upon white. The statutory definition, particularly by its inclusion of maps, makes it clear that for the purposes of the Act something may be a drawing notwithstanding that it is coloured. However, the essence of a drawing remains the concept of a representation of some object by a pictorial line."
Case650,cited,Millar &amp; Lang Ltd v Polak [1908] 1 Ch 433,"Certainly for something to be a ""drawing"" for copyright purposes no great complexity or (as the statute tells us) artistic quality is required. In Millar &amp; Lang Ltd v Polak [1908] 1 Ch 433 the works held to be drawings included words such as ""Greetings"", ""Friends ever"". ""Good luck"", ""Lest we forget"", and ""For old times sake"" in a distinctive form within an ornamental oval or circular scroll. In Roland Corporation v Lorenzo &amp; Sons Pty Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 111 the devices held by Pincus J to be drawings were based on the letters R and B but, as is apparent from the report at 112, were quite stylised. As his Honour said at 114, they were ""by no means random and were plainly drawn with care, to obtain an effect"". Clearly a letter or letters of the alphabet can provide the subject matter for a drawing. One thinks of the illuminated manuscripts of medieval works such as the Book of Kells. However, in the present case the text is fulfilling a semiotic function. It is communicating to the reader the message that within the cardboard box will be found a wooden photo box with 6 albums which hold 120 10 x 15 cm photos. The pictorial image of that box is conveyed by a photograph, which is not a drawing."

Case652,cited,Metwally v University of Wollongong (No 2) [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71,"It appears that, although not pleaded, this issue was at least touched on in the court below. It is discussed at [34]-[37] of the judgment. Mr Minahan objected to this late amendment, citing the decision of the High Court in Metwally v University of Wollongong (No 2) [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71: It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances it would contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case has been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so. 32 The application to amend should be refused, primarily for the reason that the proposed amendment lacks arguable merit. The notion of compilation involves a collecting and putting together or arranging or organising of disparate data. That is not the case with the appellant's label. It is simply a photograph and a description of an object. It conveys the one message. 33 The appellant's case was pleaded in the common law tort of passing off as well as alleged contraventions of ss 52 and 53 (c) and (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Section 52 prohibits conduct in trade or commerce which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. More specifically, s 53(c) and (d) prohibits representations that goods or a corporation have sponsorship or approval which they do not have."

Case656,applied,Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v F S Walton &amp; Co Ltd [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641,"Moreover, the learned Magistrate's findings support a conclusion that this was a case of deliberate copying. I would apply the principle in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v F S Walton &amp; Co Ltd [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641 at 657. 56 On the trade practices causes of action the appellant's damages claim is based on the number of sales of the respondents' offending boxes. The appellant claims the gross profit on an equivalent number of sales it says it has lost. 57 There were 676 such sales by the respondents. The lowest profit margin for the appellant, being that on its small photo boxes, was $5.45. The resultant figure is $3684.20."
Case657,applied,I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109,"In my view, the appellant's approach is a realistic one. The competing products were presented side by side to consumers. As already noted, the effect of the offending packaging was likely to induce consumers into thinking that they were getting the same product from the same source but would be saving money by not having to pay for more elaborate packaging, which they did not need. The misleading and deceptive conduct only has to be one among a number of causes which contributes to a consumer decision harmful to a plaintiff. As Gleeson CJ said in I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at [33] : In most business transactions resulting in financial loss there are multiple causes of the loss. The statutory purpose would be defeated if the remedy under s 82 were restricted to loss of which the contravening conduct was the sole cause. 60 While the appellant's claim is based on gross profit lost, that seems a practical measure in the circumstances of this case. It is a modest claim because it assumes that all sales lost were of the small box, which had the lowest margin. It would be an artificial exercise to attempt to calculate some proportion of that profit which represented savings of fixed costs. This case was properly brought in the Federal Magistrates Court, a jurisdiction which is expected to operate as informally as possible: Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) ss 3(2)(a) and 42 . In a case of this nature parties should not feel they have to engage forensic accountants and similar experts. 61 The appeal will be allowed and the judgment below set aside. In lieu thereof there will be judgment for the appellant against the respondents (the liability of the first respondent under s 79(1)(c) of the Trade Practices Act was not in dispute). The amount of that judgment will be $3684.20 plus appropriate interest under s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 62 There remain the questions of costs. As already mentioned, the learned Magistrate made an order for indemnity costs. The respondents had made Calderbank offers as follows: &#8226; 5 April 2006: an undertaking to cease selling products with the offending packaging &#8226; 27 April 2006: the undertaking, $3775 for costs and $1200 damages &#8226; 19 May 2006: the undertaking, $4331 for costs and $2706 damages &#8226; 2 June 2006: the undertaking, $4331 for costs and $9000 damages. (The time for compliance with this offer was extended on two occasions). 63 I direct that the appellant within seven days file written submissions as to interest and costs and that the respondent file answering submissions within seven days thereafter.

Case658,cited,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507,"Federal Magistrate Cameron found that there had been no jurisdictional error on the part of the reconstituted Tribunal (at [21]). His Honour observed that the appellant only identified, in support of an inference of apprehended bias, the second s 424A letter and the Tribunal's ultimate findings (at [14]). His Honour observed that absent a response by the appellant to that letter, there was nothing upon which to base a conclusion that the Tribunal's mind was closed. His Honour commented further that it was unsurprising that, in the absence of a response from the appellant, the matters raised in the second s 424A letter ultimately formed at least part of the reasons why the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision and the two coincided. His Honour also noted that the fact that the second s 424A letter disclosed a predisposition on the part of the Tribunal is not indicative of a closed mind (at [15] citing Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [71] - [72] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J)."
Case659,applied,SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291,"As to the alleged breach of s 424A of the Act, the information with regard to letters from members of the Awami League was contained in advice received from the Australian High Commission in Dhaka. That information was put to the appellant for comment in the first s 424A letter sent by the first Tribunal. It was not contained in the second s 424A letter. However, as Cameron FM pointed out, the s 424A information was sent by the Tribunal to the appellant (at [17]). The fact that the first s 424A letter was sent by the first Tribunal and not the reconstituted Tribunal, does not make it any less a letter pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act for the purposes of the second hearing (at [18]). Federal Magistrate Cameron referred in this respect to SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291. 6 In his notice of appeal setting forth the grounds of appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court the appellant raises, in effect, the same grounds as those raised before his Honour. 7 The first ground asserts error on the part of the Federal Magistrate and failure to provide relief because it is said the reconstituted Tribunal cannot rely on the first s 424A letter, sent by the first Tribunal. 8 The second ground alleges that there was a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal member had made up his mind to affirm the decision of the delegate at the time when the reconstituted Tribunal sought to comply with its obligations under s 424A of the Act. The particulars given of that ground set forth the tests to be applied in the determination of apprehended bias and an assertion that the Tribunal member had already decided to affirm the decision of the delegate at the time that the letter was sent. 9 As to the first ground, I do not see any error in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate or his Honour's reliance on SZEPZ . The information that formed part of the reason for decision of the reconstituted Tribunal, which it was obliged to provide to the appellant for comment, was the information as to false documents that was contained in the first s 424A letter. As such, it was available to the reconstituted Tribunal to rely upon it without further requirement that it be sent to the appellant again. Although it is for the member of the reconstituted Tribunal to provide the consideration of what would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming a decision under review, the sending of information for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act and the receipt of information for the purposes of s 424A(3)(b) does not depend on the identity of the particular member constituting the Tribunal ( SZEPZ at [39] [40]). 10 I also agree with his Honour's reasons for rejecting the claim of apprehended bias. No basis to support this ground has been made out. The appellant appeared before me in person assisted by an interpreter. When asked to expand upon this ground, he asserted that the Tribunal had made its decision in bad faith but was unable to provide particulars other than his wish to have the decision set aside so that he could put more information, being further material that was not before the Tribunal at the time of his decision. to the Tribunal in order to enable it to come, he said, to a different conclusion. 11 I have not discerned jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal nor error on the part of the Federal Magistrate. 12 It follows that the appeal must be dismissed. The appellant is to pay the first respondent's costs. I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.

Case664,distinguished,"Arnick Holdings Limited and Ankar Pty Ltd v Australian Bank Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales (Equity Division), Bryson J, 4 December 1987)","My attention was drawn to Arnick Holdings Limited and Ankar Pty Ltd v Australian Bank Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales (Equity Division), Bryson J, 4 December 1987) by counsel for Mr Callipari. That case turned on the findings of Bryson J on the evidence. Given my findings of fact, I do not think it assists me in the resolution of this case. 45 Finally, counsel for Mr Callipari submitted in the alternative that Web Wealth has acted in a manner by which it unequivocally surrendered its security. The question was asked rhetorically; if Web Wealth held security why did it not raise the issue earlier than it did? I have considered that question when making my findings of fact. I do not consider that there is anything which indicates that Web Wealth surrendered its security, or acted in a way which amounts to a waiver of its rights to enforce the security or to an election to surrender it or not to enforce it. 46 The parties were agreed upon the appropriate form of orders if I were to reach the conclusion I have reached. I think they are appropriate. I accordingly declare that Web Wealth Pty Ltd has an interest in the fund comprising the proceeds of sale of the land described in Certificates of Title Register Book Volume 9983 Folio 505 and Volume 9593 Folio 463 (""the properties"") corresponding to the equitable mortgage in its favour created by the deposit of duplicate certificates of title by Helimount Pty Ltd in January 2005.

Counsel refers to the statement by Gleeson CJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [37] that: Fairness is not an abstract concept. It is essentially practical. Whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice. Counsel also referred to Adler v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] NSWCA 131 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 504 at [139] where Giles JA quoted from Greek Herald Pty Ltd v Nikolopoulos (2001) 54 NSWLR 165 at [18] where Mason P had said that ""pleadings serve the ends of justice [and] must not be permitted to assume an independent self-referential function""."
Case666,discussed,Adsett v Berlouis (1992) 37 FCR 201,"Tribunal, however, saw the question as being not one of requiring a different mode of delivery, but one of ensuring a sufficient margin of time to allow for any risk of mail delays. This was necessary, according to the Tribunal, in order for a liquidator ""to perform the work with reasonable care and skill and in an efficient and economical way"" (at [222]), citing Adsett v Berlouis (1992) 37 FCR 201 ( Adsett ) at 212. The Tribunal concluded that the late lodgement was the fault of Mr Gould or his staff. It described that fault as not a serious one, but said that the gravamen of Contention 6.5 was not the late posting but the charging of the late fee as an expense of the liquidation (at [223]). A separate submission made by Mr Gould was, according the Tribunal, based on Mr Gould's right of lien. There were inadequate funds in the liquidation to pay all of Mr Gould's remuneration and expenses, and he was owed many thousands of dollars in fees. His argument was that since the entire fund at the time was payable to him, the $120 was, in effect, paid to him because he would have been entitled at the time to transfer the entire fund to himself for work performed. It followed, according to Mr Gould's submission, that his choice to pay $120 of the funds to ASIC rather than to himself could not be properly the subject of criticism. The Tribunal also cited various passages from Adsett , and implied that the expenditure on the late fees was not ""reasonable"", was not ""prudently and reasonably incurred"", and was not incurred ""conformably with the duty to perform the work with reasonable care and skill and in an efficient and economical way"" (at [228]). The Tribunal concluded its discussion of Contention 6.5 as follows (at [229]): ""While the evidence does not warrant a finding of fraud, neither does it depict a genuine misapprehension and a sincere belief that the action was justified, as the applicant submitted. His endeavours to obtain waiver of the fees suggest that he knew that he was personally responsible for them. And describing the payment as ""Lodgement fees"" in the May 1999 Form 524 was disingenuous at best. The applicant plainly knew he had something to hide and tried to hide it."" As indicated at [167] above, I do not agree that Mr Gould's endeavour to obtain a waiver was an acknowledgment of personal responsibility for the fees."
Case667,discussed,Ah Toy v Registrar of Companies (1986) 10 FCR 356,"Tribunal rejected a submission made by Mr Gould in reliance on Ah Toy v Registrar of Companies (1986) 10 FCR 356. In that case, at 381, a Full Court of this Court accepted that circumstances could arise in which it would be accurate to characterise a debit to an estate of penalty fees as a ""fraud on the creditors"", but considered that that would be so only where the penalty fees had been incurred at ""as a result of the neglect or omission of the liquidator"" (at 381). In the case before their Honours there was no evidence as to the circumstances under which the penalty fees had become payable: the fault may have lain with the liquidator or with another party or ""may have been caused by circumstances outside the control of the liquidator and his agents"" (at 381). Their Honours observed that a finding of fraud, especially against a professional person in relation to his or her professional activities, should be made only upon the basis of clear evidence and after the person concerned has had the opportunity to deal with the matter. The Tribunal distinguished Ah Toy . It considered that the Full Court was directing its attention to the trial judge's finding that the liquidator's charging the company's estate with a total of $127 for late filing fees was ""most reprehensible"" and ""a fraud on the creditors, small but important, as indicating serious impropriety"" (at 380). The Tribunal remarked (at [220]): ""It was the finding of fraud that the court set aside, not the finding that the late fee should not have been charged to the estate as such. That would depend on whose fault it was that the documents were lodged late. In this case it can only have been the applicant's."" In substance the Tribunal decided that if Mr Gould chose to rely on the post, he had to accept the risk of incurring a late filing fee ""or else allow a margin of a couple of days to guard against the risk of late delivery"" (at [221]). The Tribunal recorded Mr Gould's evidence that it was widely regarded as competent practice to mail forms to ASIC, that it was extraordinary for that course to fail and that he had not known of a prior occasion when the mail had ""failed"". The Tribunal also noted Mr Gould's evidence that to require a different mode of delivery in all cases would increase the cost to creditors, for no real benefit in nearly all cases. The Tribunal said (at [227]) that it did not think the facts warranted a finding of fraud, but nor did it think that Mr Gould was justified in treating the expense as a reasonable expense of the liquidation or as otherwise proper. Indeed, the Tribunal thought that the reasoning in Ah Toy strongly suggested the opposite."

Mr Gould submits that this question is one of judgment, not a pure question of law, and that the answer must be informed by evidence of accepted proper practice: Mr Gould refers to Re Vouris; Epromotions Australia Pty Ltd and Relectronic-Remech Pty Ltd (in liq) [2003] NSWSC 702 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 155 at [101] and [103] Goodman v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 50 ACSR 1 at [26]; Dean-Willcocks at [24]-[26]; Albarran v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2007] HCA 23 ; (2007) 231 CLR 350 at [18] , [20] and [24]."
Case669,discussed,Anderson and Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2007] AATA 1540,"Tribunal dealt with the question of whether Mr Gould's consent could operate nunc pro tunc . It referred to Ascot Investment and Management v Livestock Genetics (1999) 205 LSJS 247 ( Ascot ) and Re Anderson and Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2007] AATA 1540 ( Anderson ). In Anderson the Tribunal reviewed a decision under s 1292(2)(d)(ii) of the Act. It was alleged that an administrator had not complied s 439A(4) of the Act. The administrator had been appointed on 12 February 2004 but had not consented to act until four days later. Although the point was not argued, neither ASIC, nor the Board nor the Tribunal expressed any doubt about the validity of the appointment. The Tribunal noted (at [102]) that ASIC did not dispute the correctness or applicability of Ascot or Anderson . The Tribunal concluded that there was no legal impediment to the adoption of an appointment resolution that operated conditionally on the appointee's consenting to the appointment. The Tribunal entered a caveat: the consent must be given within a timeframe that was appropriate to the procedure in question, but the Tribunal saw no difficulty in this respect in the present case in which the lapse of time was of only some three weeks.

Section 440D of the Law provided that during the administration of a company, a proceeding in a court against the company or in relation to any of its property could not be begun or proceeded with, except with the administrator's written consent or with the leave of the Court. The Tribunal said (at [100]) that Smith DCJ had held that s 440D did not ""invalidate that part of the proceedings that had unfolded before the date of consent"".

Case671,distinguished,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"Gould submits that the Board's decision that it was satisfied of the existence of the ground set out in s 1292(2)(d) was itself a reviewable decision, similar to the decision in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 ( Bond ) that the licensees were no longer fit and proper persons to hold broadcasting licences under s 88 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 (Cth). Counsel for Mr Gould refers to passages in the various judgments in Bond in which it was recognised that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's ""finding"" that licensees were no longer fit and proper persons to hold their licences was itself a decision under an enactment because, although it was also a step on the way to the ultimate decision whether to revoke or suspend the licence or to impose conditions, it was a decision on a matter of substance for which the statute provided as an essential preliminary to the ultimate decision: see Mason CJ at 337, 339; Brennan J at 365; Deane J at 369; Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 377. The Tribunal stated (at [31]) that it was not contested that the decision under review before the Tribunal was the Board's decision to make a suspension order as allowed for by the concluding words of s 1292(2). The Tribunal said that the reaching of a state of satisfaction that the grounds for the making of that order were made out was a step along the way to the ultimate decision and was not itself reviewable. The Tribunal also referred to Bond at 336-338 per Mason CJ. However, Mason CJ qualified his description of the position that ""ordinarily"" prevailed as mentioned above. Section 1317B(1) of the Law (and of the Act) provided that application might be made to the Tribunal for review of, relevantly, a decision made under the Law (or the Act) by the Board. It is at least clear that the Board's decision to suspend Mr Gould's registration as a liquidator was a decision made under an enactment (cf s 1292(2) of the Law and of the Act) and was reviewable by the Tribunal. I will assume, by reference to the passages from Bond referred to above, that the Board's being satisfied of any of the states of affairs referred to in s 1292(2)(d) is also a decision made under the statute, and that the Tribunal erred in stating otherwise. Nonetheless, I do not see how this avails Mr Gould, because Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A were relied on by ASIC as supporting that essential intermediate decision, as well as the ultimate decision to suspend Mr Gould's registration. The same principles must govern the question whether it was permissible for the Tribunal to entertain those Contentions, regardless of whether the Tribunal was reviewing the ultimate decision to suspend or the essential intermediate decision in the nature of the making of a finding. I do not think that there is merit in Mr Gould's first submission. Mr Gould secondly submits that an assumption by the Tribunal of jurisdiction over charges that were not previously the subject of a Board determination deprives a member of the profession of his or her right to have a ""merits review"": appeals from the Tribunal are on questions of law only (see s 44(1) of the AAT Act). The five legal principles and the authorities that Mr Gould cites in support of them are as follows: (a) ASIC must act with reasonable promptness and diligence in prosecuting charges in respect of a matter or complaint that comes to its attention: Herron v McGregor (1986) 6 NSWLR 246 at 254; Gill Herron and Gardiner v Walton (1991) 25 NSWLR 190 at 208A per Kirby P; R v Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police ; ex parte Calveley [1986] QB 424 ( Calveley ); (b) A prosecutor will generally be permitted to have only one ""bite of the cherry"" in respect of any formal hearing of charges against a defendant in respect of a matter in issue: Walter Construction Group v Fair Trading Administrative Corporation [2005] NSWCA 65 ; (c) A decision by an administrative body or court to stay or to refuse to deal with charges on the ground that their prosecution would be unfair and oppressive to the defendant may prevent them from being re-agitated, even if the fresh proceeding could be conducted without unfairness to the defendant, by analogy to principles which inform the rule against double jeopardy or as a species of double jeopardy: Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 396-398 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 58 per Deane J; Gill v Walton (1991) 25 NSWLR 190 at 200-202 per Gleeson CJ, at 206-207 per Kirby P; (d) Allegations which, owing to the delay in their being prosecuted, may prejudice the defendant and deny him or her his right to a fair hearing, may be stayed: Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 ; (e) If, because of the above matters or otherwise, it would be unfair or oppressive to a defendant to face the charges in question, a tribunal such as the Tribunal, is required to stay or to decline to hear the charges: Re Moline and Comcare (2003) 77 ALD 224 , [2003] AATA 827 ; Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Air Services Australia (1997) 146 ALR 1 at 40-42 per Finn J; Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd v Moorehead (1912) 15 CLR 332 at 342 per Griffith CJ; Logue v Shoalhaven Shire Council [1979] 1 NSWLR 537 at 558-9 per Mahoney J; SCI Operations Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (1996) 139 ALR 595 ; Greiner v Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (1992) 28 NSWLR 125."
Case672,followed,Dean-Willcocks v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board (2006) 59 ACSR 698 ; [2006] FCA 1438,"Law did not specify that a cap was required. In Dean-Willcocks v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board &amp; Anor (2006) 59 ACSR 698 ; [2006] FCA 1438 ( Dean-Willcocks ), however, Tamberlin J accepted that in determining whether a registered liquidator has failed to carry out or perform ""adequately and properly"" any duties or functions required by Australian law to be carried out or performed by a registered liquidator for the purposes of s 1292(2)(d)(ii) , it was permissible to test performance of the registered liquidator in the office of administrator against professional standards and codes (at [21]-[34]). Moreover, his Honour held that the concept of the performance of the function of an administrator was wide enough to include the acceptance of appointment to that office (at [32]). Tamberlin J's views must apply a fortiori to s 1292(2)(d)(i) and the office of a liquidator a fortiori because an argument, based on the presence of the words ""required by an Australian law to be carried out or performed by a registered liquidator"" in para (ii) of s 1292(2)(d) , that subsection (2) refers only to legislative prescriptions (an argument rejected by his Honour) is not available in respect of para (i). ASIC's proposition was that by not including a cap or upper limit, Mr Gould had fallen short of a professional standard which was stated in the Capping provisions of the Guide and the Statement. Before the Tribunal ASIC relied on the tender of those documents unsupported by any expert testimony. The Guide and the Statement of the IPAA On 20 December 1997 the IPAA issued the Guide, called a ""Guide to Hourly Rates"", to have effect from 1 December 1997. The Guide included certain Classifications by reference to insolvency experience and Hourly Rates chargeable in respect of persons falling within the various classes. In Dean-Willcocks , two Codes of Professional Conduct issued by the IPAA and the Institute of Chartered Accounts in Australia dealt with professional independence, conflicts of interest, and disclosure of relationships that might be thought to impinge on the independence of a registered liquidator acting as administrator. Moreover, CALDB relied on evidence of an expert (Mr Lombe). The words ""or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator"" provide an alternative to the criteria that precede in subparas (i) and (ii). Paragraph (d) must, however, be read as a whole. Its criteria can be analysed as follows (I will refer only to para (i) but the same analysis applies to para (ii)): (1) failure to perform adequately and properly the duties of a liquidator; or (2) being otherwise not a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator. The word ""otherwise"" shows that the provision takes it for granted that a failure of the kind described in (1) will, without more, demonstrate that the person is not a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator. Consistently with this understanding, the expression ""the duties of a liquidator"" directs attention, not to a specific duty or even to two or more specific duties, but to the duties in general of a liquidator. Of course, whether a registered liquidator has failed to perform adequately and properly the duties in general of a liquidator will be decided by reference to his or her failure to perform specific duties. Both limbs (1) and (2) call for an exercise of assessment, evaluation and judgment in relation to the registered liquidator's conduct. It is not enough, for example, in a mechanical and arithmetical way, simply to seek to identify a minimum of two failures to perform adequately and properly particular duties. Whether the Capping provisions in the Guide and the Statement were ""professional standards"" of the kind to which Tamberlin J was referring in Dean-Willcocks , depends on whether they purported to establish levels of ""adequate"" and ""proper"" performance that a registered liquidator must attain at peril of enlivening criterion (1) or criterion (2) above a serious matter. I do not think that they did. Two considerations lead me to this conclusion. First, neither Capping provision was contained in a document that purported to lay down standards of professional conduct of that kind. Second, the ambiguous and loose language of the Capping provisions themselves is not what one would expect of such a standard. The Guide purported to provide guidance, and stated that it was not to be used in every instance. These features characterised the Guide as a whole. There is no reason to exclude from them the Capping provision. I turn now to the language of the Guide's Capping provision. No doubt a professional standard of the kind contemplated by Tamberlin J in Dean-Willcocks may be attended by ambiguity. Moreover, as indicated above, I accept that in the present cases remuneration was approved prospectively. However, the loose language and uncertainty of the Capping provision of the Guide suggests that it was not intended by the IPAA to be a professional standard in the sense described. The Statement likewise does not establish a professional standard in that sense. First, it is a Statement of ""Best Practice"", not of a minimum required. As the ""Conclusion"" makes clear, the Statement was not intended to be prescriptive (see [69] above). Secondly, there are again certain ambiguities touching the Capping provision. I referred to two of these at [67] and [107] above. Whereas the Capping provision in the Guide predicated a ""resolution for remuneration"", that in the Statement predicates a ""resolution for approval of remuneration"". As in the Guide, it is unclear what the ""specified amount"" is to be a specified amount of. Mr Gould submits that in the absence of expert evidence, it was not permissible for the Tribunal to find that he had not carried out or performed his duties as liquidator of Popwing ""adequately and properly"". Mr Gould submits that this question is one of judgment, not a pure question of law, and that the answer must be informed by evidence of accepted proper practice: Mr Gould refers to Re Vouris; Epromotions Australia Pty Ltd and Relectronic-Remech Pty Ltd (in liq) [2003] NSWSC 702 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 155 at [101] and [103] Goodman v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 50 ACSR 1 at [26]; Dean-Willcocks at [24]-[26]; Albarran v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2007] HCA 23 ; (2007) 231 CLR 350 at [18] , [20] and [24]."
Case673,followed,Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1979] AATA 179 ; (1979) 24 ALR 577,"noting the parties' submissions, the Tribunal addressed the question whether its jurisdiction to review was limited by reference to the scope of ASIC's application before the Board. The Tribunal said (at [30]) that its role was to determine the correct or preferable decision on the material before the Tribunal, not on the material that was before the primary decision-maker, and that the Tribunal was required to review the primary decision, not the reasons given for it, citing Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1979] AATA 179 ; (1979) 24 ALR 577 ( Drake ) at 589, 599. The Tribunal thought that Mr Gould's submission sought to read too much into the word ""on"" in the expression ""on an application by ASIC"" in s 1292(2). The Tribunal stated (at [34]) that to confine the review before it to the grounds contained in the original application (as amended) would be a significant departure from the usual pattern of merits review under the AAT Act as analysed in Drake and succeeding cases."

Counsel refers to the statement by Gleeson CJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [37] that: Fairness is not an abstract concept. It is essentially practical. Whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice.

Case676,distinguished,Green v United States [1957] USSC 146 ; 355 US 184 (1957),"Gould addresses an argument relied on by ASIC before the Tribunal and accepted by it, namely, that because it was Mr Gould who chose to apply to the Tribunal for review of the Board's decision, ASIC should not be prevented from re-agitating the charges rejected by the Board. Mr Gould submits that the Tribunal should have followed the approach of the United States Supreme Court in Green v United States [1957] USSC 146 ; 355 US 184 (1957). In that case, the defendant faced alternative charges of first and second degree murder. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of second degree murder and did not return a verdict on the first charge. The defendant successfully appealed and the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial. At the retrial, the defendant was again charged with first degree murder. The trial judge ruled that the rule against double jeopardy did not apply. The defendant was convicted of first degree murder. He appealed. The opinion of the Supreme Court was given by Black J who said at 187-188: ... The State, with all its resources and power, should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that, even though innocent, he may be found guilty. Later, at 193, Black J stated: Whatever may be said for the notion of continuing jeopardy with regard to an offense when a defendant has been convicted of that offense and has secured reversal of the conviction by appeal, here, Green was not convicted of first degree murder, and that offense was not involved in his appeal. If Green had only appealed his conviction of arson and that conviction had been set aside, surely no one would claim that he could have been tried a second time for the first degree murder by reasoning that his initial jeopardy on that charge continued until every offense alleged in the indictment had been finally adjudicated. Reduced to plain terms, the Government contends that, in order to secure the reversal of an erroneous conviction of one offense, a defendant must surrender his valid defence of former jeopardy not only on that offense, but also on a different offense for which he was not convicted and which was not involved in his appeal. Or, stated in the terms of this case, he must be willing to barter his constitutional protection against a second prosecution for an offense punishable by death as the price of a successful appeal from an erroneous conviction of another offense for which he has been sentenced to five to twenty years' imprisonment. As the Court of Appeal said in its first opinion in this case, a defendant faced with such a 'choice' takes a 'desperate chance' in securing the reversal of the erroneous conviction. The law should not, and in our judgment does not, place the defendant in such an incredible dilemma. Mr Gould had no finding against him before the Board on Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A, and should not, according to his submission, be put in jeopardy on those charges in his application for review to the Tribunal. ASIC submits that there was no oppressive conduct or unfair dealing by it in relation to Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A. ASIC relies on a point made by the Tribunal in rejecting Mr Gould's interlocutory application, namely, that situation before the Tribunal was materially different from that which had been before the Board. Before the Board, the application to amend was made at the end of a proceeding. Before the Tribunal, ASIC was giving notice through its SOFAC of allegations at the outset of a new proceeding. The United States case of Green v United States is distinguishable. The primary objective of the sanctions for which s 1292(2) provided was to protect the public where a person was shown not to be a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator and as such to perform the duties of a liquidator or administrator. The criminal sanction for first degree murder is quite different in that the right of the accused to be treated fairly assumes the greatest importance. In the case of the disciplinary proceedings against Mr Gould, the protection of public was the dominant consideration. This factor also tells against other submissions made by Mr Gould, such as his submission asserting delay and oppression. Question 24 (set out at [260] above) should be answered ""no""."

The failure to take reasonable steps to ensure that the statement was not false or misleading is an essential element of the offence. Contention 6.6 is deficient for failing to allege and particularise the failure to take reasonable steps. If Contention 6.6 and the particulars that ASIC gave of it had been an information for criminal purposes, it would have been quashed as insufficient in law and invalid: see, for example, John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42 ; (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 519-520.

The five legal principles and the authorities that Mr Gould cites in support of them are as follows: (a) ASIC must act with reasonable promptness and diligence in prosecuting charges in respect of a matter or complaint that comes to its attention: Herron v McGregor (1986) 6 NSWLR 246 at 254; Gill Herron and Gardiner v Walton (1991) 25 NSWLR 190 at 208A per Kirby P; R v Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police ; ex parte Calveley [1986] QB 424 ( Calveley ); (b) A prosecutor will generally be permitted to have only one ""bite of the cherry"" in respect of any formal hearing of charges against a defendant in respect of a matter in issue: Walter Construction Group v Fair Trading Administrative Corporation [2005] NSWCA 65 ; (c) A decision by an administrative body or court to stay or to refuse to deal with charges on the ground that their prosecution would be unfair and oppressive to the defendant may prevent them from being re-agitated, even if the fresh proceeding could be conducted without unfairness to the defendant, by analogy to principles which inform the rule against double jeopardy or as a species of double jeopardy: Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 396-398 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 58 per Deane J; Gill v Walton (1991) 25 NSWLR 190 at 200-202 per Gleeson CJ, at 206-207 per Kirby P; (d) Allegations which, owing to the delay in their being prosecuted, may prejudice the defendant and deny him or her his right to a fair hearing, may be stayed: Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 ; (e) If, because of the above matters or otherwise, it would be unfair or oppressive to a defendant to face the charges in question, a tribunal such as the Tribunal, is required to stay or to decline to hear the charges: Re Moline and Comcare (2003) 77 ALD 224 , [2003] AATA 827 ; Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Air Services Australia (1997) 146 ALR 1 at 40-42 per Finn J; Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd v Moorehead (1912) 15 CLR 332 at 342 per Griffith CJ; Logue v Shoalhaven Shire Council [1979] 1 NSWLR 537 at 558-9 per Mahoney J; SCI Operations Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (1996) 139 ALR 595 ; Greiner v Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (1992) 28 NSWLR 125."
Case679,discussed,National Education Advancement Programs (NEAP) Pty Ltd v Ashton (1995) 33 IPR 281,"National Education Advancement Programs (NEAP) Pty Ltd v Ashton (1995) 33 IPR 281 , Young J had to consider the question whether s 219 of the Law required an examination paper marketed by the plaintiff for use by schools for trial examinations to bear the plaintiff's ACN number. The answer turned on the question whether examination papers fell within s 88A of the Act. His Honour said (at p 293): An examination paper is not within the items specifically excluded from the definition in s 88A and one would have thought that such papers are closer to the categories of business letters etc than what is exempt, namely packaging. However, it does seem to me that the exercise in statutory interpretation is to look to see what is ejusdem generis with business letter, statement of account, invoice, receipt etc. All these documents are documents used in trade or commerce. An examination paper or a book or other writings which are intellectual property would seem to me to be in a different class. Young J said that while it was difficult to work out from ss 88A and 219 exactly where to draw the line, the test seemed to be whether the document concerned was one that was possibly part of a process of a business transaction or business contract involving the company. He said that if the document was non-contractual, the ACN number did not have to appear, because the purpose of s 219 appeared to be to make it clear that when a person was dealing with a company, exactly which company in perhaps a group of similarly named companies or companies using similar trading names, was the one with which the person was dealing. In my opinion, the purpose of s 450E(2) is generally similar: to make it clear to persons who are having or are contemplating having business dealings with the company or extending credit to it, that they are or will be dealing with a company that is subject to a DOCA. All five letters concerned were addressed to creditors of the particular company, Sisterella or Trinbay, that was subject to a DOCA. McPherson's Law of Company Liquidation (4 th ed, 2000, by Andrew Keay) states as follows in relation to the lien of a liquidator (at p 305): Liquidators normally have an equitable lien over the funds and assets in her or his control, not only for the costs and expenses of obtaining the property or funds but also for general remuneration [ Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Samalot Enterprises Pty Ltd (No 2) (1986) 5 NSWLR 227 ; 10 ACLR 748 , Shirlaw v Taylor (1991) 9 ACLC 1235]. While this has been accepted as the general position, Young J stated in Re Biposo Pty Ltd (No 4) [Unreported, Supreme Court, NSW, 12 December 1995] that it is an over-simplification to say that there was a lien over all of the moneys which liquidators have in their possession. His Honour went on to say that that is the normal situation, but the lien only arose if a court of equity felt that it was conscionable that there be a lien. I paraphrased the Tribunal's reasons in relation to Mr Gould's lien submission at [187] [188] above. That submission was raised for the first time in six lines in Mr Gould's written submissions before the Tribunal (para 161). While the Tribunal did not deal with the submission at length, it made it clear that the reason why the lien submission was not accepted was that the late fees were not a proper expense of the liquidation. I agree that they were not and that any lien that Mr Gould had did not extend to cover the $120. Moreover, when Mr Gould paid the $120 out of Popwing's liquidation account on 5 February 1999, he was not appropriating to himself money in part payment of fees then due to him. That he was not doing so is shown by the fact that neither in his later invoice nor elsewhere did he give credit for the sum of $120 as a payment of his fees. Nor was he preserving the fund as security for whatever fees might ultimately prove to be payable to him. At that time he was simply using money that he held for company purposes to pay $120 that he was personally liable to pay. His doing so cannot be justified retrospectively by a reconstruction of events or by an argument based on some concept of economic equivalence."

This approach was said to be consistent with s 43(1) of the AAT Act. It supports the view that the Tribunal's role and the Tribunal proceeding were independent of the Board's role and the Board proceeding. Once this fact is fully appreciated, any force that Mr Gould's present submission might be thought to have disappears. In my view there is no substance in Mr Gould's second submission either. Question 23 (set out at [260] above) should also be answered ""yes"". Parties' submissions relevant to Question 24 Finally, ASIC submits that Mr Gould's argument that it is unfair that he was denied a merits review after an adverse finding by the primary decision maker could also be said in relation to the facts in Shi . A person in Mr Shi's position could be found by the Tribunal to be unfit based on new facts that emerged after the original decision was made. According to the High Court, however, the fact that there might be no merits review on the new facts as found by the Tribunal was not an impediment to the Tribunal's acting on those new facts. Consideration of Question 24 In my opinion, ASIC's submissions should in substance be accepted. The proceeding before the Tribunal was a new and independent proceeding in which the Tribunal was required, for the protection of the public, to arrive at the correct or preferred decision on the evidence before it."
Case682,followed,Sleiman and Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] AATA 1383,"Tribunal saw the issue between the parties as being whether there was a statutory provision to the contrary of the view that effective exercise of the Tribunal's review power normally required it to be free to consider the application of any of the criteria on which the proper exercise of the statutory power might depend: the Tribunal cited Sleiman and Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] AATA 1383 ( Sleiman ) at [9]. Sleiman was also concerned with an application by ASIC to the CALDB in relation to a registered liquidator. In that case, as in the present one, s 1317B of the Law (s 1317B of the Act is in the same terms) permitted an application to be made to the Tribunal for review of a decision made under the Act by the Board. The Tribunal found nothing in s 1292 or s 1317B to alter the ordinary position as recognised in that line of cases, and referred with approval to Senior Member Taylor's statement in Sleiman at [10] that: ... it is likely to be appropriate, subject to being satisfied that Mr Sleiman has a proper opportunity to deal with them, and subject to any order that might be made under s 25(4A) of the AAT Act, for ASIC to seek to support the cancellation order against Mr Sleiman on the additional grounds contained in its amended Statement of Facts and Contentions. Consideration of Tribunals' decision of 2 November 2007 not to preclude ASIC from relying on Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A Question 23 Question 23 raises the question whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear and determine Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A.

Mr Gould also denied that he had contravened s 1308(4). In his statement Mr Gould said (at para 177), after referring to the reference in s 1308(4) to the omission to take reasonable steps, that his staff, who were qualified beyond industry standards and practice, had filled out the Forms 524.

Case689,applied,Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1,"considerations which are to inform the exercise of the discretion were stated by a Full Court in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1. See also Apache Northwest Pty Ltd v Newcrest Mining Ltd [2009] FCAFC 39 in relation to the principles applicable under O 15A r 6. Two of the considerations referred to in Hooper are critical to the determination of the present application. The first is that, although an applicant is not required to demonstrate the existence of a prima facie case against the prospective respondent, the power conferred by O 15A r 3 is not to be exercised in favour of a person who intends to commence ""merely speculative proceedings"". The prospects of success are a material factor in the exercise of the discretion: Hooper at [33]. The second consideration is that an applicant must show that the order is necessary in the interests of justice. Their Honours said that this means that an applicant must show that the making of the order is necessary to provide that person with an effective remedy in respect of the actionable wrong of which he or she complains: Hooper at [34]. The jurisdictional facts There was substantial argument between the parties as to whether two of the necessary jurisdictional facts were established. The first was whether Wyeth had made reasonable inquiries. The second was whether the ""proceeding"" to which O 15A r 3 refers is final or interlocutory, it being contended by the Department that Wyeth's purpose is to commence a proceeding for interlocutory relief, which is not contemplated by the Rule. These issues can be disposed of quite briefly. There was some force in Mr Howe's submission that Wyeth has not adduced any evidence of inquiries made overseas as to the identities of the sponsors. Wyeth acknowledged that TGA applications are often preceded by similar applications made in other jurisdictions. Nevertheless, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that inquiries in those jurisdictions would not be conclusive. The test stated in Hooper does not expressly stipulate any threshold which an applicant must satisfy for the exercise of the power. But in stating that a material factor in the exercise of the discretion is the prospect of success in the proceedings, the Full Court in Hooper specified, as one of the elements of the claim for identity discovery, that an applicant provide evidence in support of its claim for final relief. In my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper . Whilst good cause must be shown, each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice. Wyeth's evidence as to prospects of success"
Case690,cited,Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498,"observations of Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 at [71] [73] recognise the difficulties which may arise in restoring a patentee to the position it occupies as the only supplier of the product in the event that the patent holder succeeds at the final hearing but is denied interlocutory relief. Nevertheless, I have come to the view that it is not in the interests of justice to order identity discovery on this application. There are two reasons for this. First, I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that Wyeth has good prospects of success at a final hearing. The most that can be said is that it has a provisional working hypothesis which would need to be supplemented by further evidence, including expert evidence, to determine the strength of Wyeth's case."
Case691,distinguished,Viskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc [2000] FCA 1695,"counsel for the Department placed considerable emphasis upon the decision of French J in Viskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc [2000] FCA 1695. There, his Honour was dealing with an application for information discovery under O 15A r 6. He said at [24] that the rule should not be permitted to authorise information discovery except for good cause shown in terms of the conditions. He continued:- In respect of patents for inventions, the exercise of the discretion must have regard both to the intrusive nature of the order and the need to encourage research and development unhampered by the prospect of speculative review of working papers by competitors. To allow the remedy in this case based upon formulaic recitations of wide application would set the threshold for pre-action discovery so low that there would be few cases in which a person wishing to challenge a patent could not obtain discovery of the kind which is sought here. However, these remarks are to be read in their context. His Honour expressed the view at [23] that the evidence which was required to satisfy the first element of O 15A r 6, namely reasonable cause to believe that an applicant has the right to obtain relief against the prospective respondent, was an opinion expressed as a conclusion stated in terms of the rule. His Honour considered that the conclusionary statement was insufficient to meet the requirements of O 15A r 6(a). I do not think it follows that his Honour's observations establish that a high threshold must be satisfied before an order will be made under O 15A r 3. It is true that French J said at [24] that if an order were made in that case it would establish a very low threshold for the application of the rule. But, in my opinion, that was because of the slender basis of the evidence in support of the ""reasonable cause to believe"". In my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper . Whilst good cause must be shown, each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice.

Case692,referred to,Aldi Stores Limited Partnership v Frito-Lay Trading GmbH (2001) 54 IPR 344 ,"The same differences are created by an aural comparison. Here, stress and pronunciation would usually given to the first syllable of the word or mark: see for example Aldi Stores Limited Partnership v Frito-Lay Trading GmbH (2001) 54 IPR 344 at [32], [157] [164]. 142 Thus, an aural comparison of the marks by the person of ordinary intelligence and memory would bear out the impression that Health Plus is concerned with enhanced general health whereas Inner Health Plus invokes improved internal health. 143 I reject Health World's submission that the Health Plus mark should be characterised as two words, at least in a visual sense. Although the word "" Plus "" is italicised, the usual impression is plainly of one word."

His Honour proceeded on the basis that the ground is available if the use of the mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion for any reason. 178 In Norco , Bryson J was of the view that there was no likelihood of deception because the packaging of the goods accurately identified the source of the goods and the registered owner of the trade mark: Norco at [84]. 179 In the present case, Health World points to the evidence which discloses that at the date of the commencement of the rectification proceedings, the Health Plus trade mark was used to identify the goods as those of Nature's Hive, and not those of Shin-Sun. I will deal with this below. 180 This would give rise to the likelihood of deception or cause confusion because of the failure to identify the registered owner as the source of the goods. 182 Pending consideration of s 88(2)(c) by a Full Court, or by the High Court, it seems to me that I should follow the approach adopted by Bryson J in Norco . On that basis the s 88(2)(c) ground is enlivened by the failure to distinguish the Health Plus products as goods of Shin-Sun. 183 In dealing, later in my judgment, with Health World's non-use application, I give six reasons why the Health Plus trade mark is used to identify the goods as those of Nature's Hive. 184 In summary, the effect of the evidence was that Shin-Sun's name has never appeared on the packaging and Nature's Hive procured the manufacture of the products."
Case695,applied,Australian Woollen Mills Limited v FS Walton &amp; Co Limited [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641 ,"These principles are well established. They were stated by Dixon and McTiernan JJ more than 50 years ago in Australian Woollen Mills Limited v FS Walton &amp; Co Limited [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641 at 658 and reiterated by the High Court in other authorities. 133 Perhaps the most succinct statement of the principles is to be found in the observation of Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Australian Woollen Mills at 659 that the question is: ... never susceptible of much discussion. It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs. 134 The Health Plus mark was not being used as at 7 May 2001. Thus, the comparison which is to be made for the purposes of s 60 is between the unregistered mark Inner Health Plus and the Health Plus registered trade mark. 135 In my opinion the Health Plus trade mark was not deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus mark for the reasons set out below."
Case696,distinguished,CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited (2000) 52 IPR 42,"Those authorities, as well as authorities of Full Courts in CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited (2000) 52 IPR 42 and Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Limited [1999] FCA 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365, were discussed by the Full Court in Crazy Ron's at [80] [90]. 196 There was nothing to suggest that Shin-Sun exercised quality control in the way in which the executors of the estate of Cyril Henschke exercised control over the Henschke partnership: Henschke at [67]. 197 Nor did Shin-Sun exercise ""financial control"" over Nature's Hive's trading activities within the meaning of s 8(4). This is because, in my view, the financial control to which the subsection is directed is a legally enforceable power of control which did not exist between Shin-Sun and Nature's Hive. 198 Ms Shin's evidence was that Nature's Hive did not have a bank account. I accept this evidence but it does not follow that Shin-Sun exercised financial control within the meaning of s 8(4). What that subsection requires is evidence of the exercise of financial control over trading activities, perhaps in the way in which a parent company may exercise control over a wholly owned subsidiary. Here, there was no such relationship and any control by Shin-Sun was revocable: Henschke at [69]. 199 Nature's Hive and Shin-Sun have different shareholders. They have common directors but that has only been the position since July 2006. Of course, in a practical sense, it may be unlikely that Ms Shin would remove her parents as directors of Nature's Hive. But that is not an answer to the separate corporate identity of Shin-Sun and the power of Ms Shin as the majority shareholder to revoke any exercise of control flowing from common directorships. 200 The ""control"" which is contemplated by s 8(5) would seem to be as wide as the ""connection in the course of trade"" to which Aickin J referred in Pioneer at 683. His Honour said that the connection may be slight, such as selection or quality control or control of the user in the sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary: see also Henschke at [70]. 223 Section 101(3) confers a broad discretion on the Court: Henschke at [72]. The discretion is conferred so as to give the Court a sufficient degree of flexibility to give effect to public interest considerations: Ritz Hotel at 221-225. 224 In Henschke , the Full Court declined to interfere with the primary judge's exercise of discretion in a manner favourable to the registered proprietor under s 101(3). However, I do not consider that the approach taken in that case assists Shin-Sun because the primary judge found that there was no public interest adversely affected by the use of the mark: see at [72]. 225 In my view, Henschke was concerned with a very distinctive family business where the members of the family who were using the mark were the persons who gave the mark its value. That was why the primary judge could see no useful purpose to be served by removing the mark so as to compel a fresh application to be made by the ""Henschke interests."" 226 Accordingly, I would not exercise my discretion in favour of Shin-Sun in the present proceedings. 227 Section 92 in the form in which it stood when Health World filed its non-use application provided that a person aggrieved had standing to bring an application."
Case697,referred to,"Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (1998) 85 FCR 331 (2000) 202 CLR 45 ","If I were of the view that the Health Plus trade mark was deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus trade mark, I would be satisfied that Health World is an aggrieved person: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited (1998) 85 FCR 331 at 364; reversed by the High Court but not on the ""aggrieved person"" issue in [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45. 126 However, for reasons set out below, in my opinion, Health Plus is not deceptively similar to INNER HEALTH PLUS. 127 Accordingly, subject to what I say below about the s 59 ground (which Health World relies upon under s 88(2)(a)) and the s 88(2)(c) ground, I do not consider that Health World is an aggrieved person. 181 It is possible that the observations of the High Court in Nike at [61], suggest a more restrictive approach to the construction of s 88(2)(c). In Nike (2000), their Honours were concerned with the provisions of s 28 of the Trade Marks Act 1955 (Cth), which was in different terms but it is part of the legislative history of s 88(2)(c) which is discussed in Shanahan at [14.230]ff."

However, the general rule of the common law, and the effect of s 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act , is that: when the law is altered during the pendency of an action the rights of the parties are decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless the new statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights: see Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v G F Heublein &amp; Bro Inc [1960] HCA 37 ; (1960) 103 CLR 422 at 427 per Kitto J. 31 All three of the proceedings described were commenced prior to the commencement of the Trade Marks Amendment Act 2006 (Cth) on 23 October 2006. The rectification proceeding was commenced on 13 February 2006. Health World's non-use application was commenced on 25 July 2006. Shin-Sun's non-use application was commenced on 15 September 2006. Thus in the absence of a clear legislative intention to the contrary, the provisions of the Act apply as they stood prior to the 2006 amendments. The relevant provisions are set out below, in their pre-amendment form. 32 Section 7 of the Act deals with the use of a trade mark. It provides: 7 Use of trade mark (1) If the Registrar or a prescribed court, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, thinks fit, the Registrar or the court may decide that a person has used a trade mark if it is established that the person has used the trade mark with additions or alterations that do not substantially affect the identity of the trade mark. (2) To avoid any doubt, it is stated that, if a trade mark consists of the following, or any combination of the following, namely, any letter, word, name or numeral, any aural representation of the trade mark is, for the purposes of this Act, a use of the trade mark. (3) An authorised use of a trade mark by a person (see section 8) is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be a use of the trade mark by the owner of the trade mark. (4) In this Act: use of a trade mark in relation to goods means use of the trade mark upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods (including second-hand goods) ... 118 The expression ""an aggrieved person"" is to be given a wide interpretation: see In the Matter of Powell's Trade Mark (1893) 10 RPC 195 at 201 (C.A. UK); (1894) 11 RPC 4 at 7-8 (HL); see also Continental Liqueurs at 427. 119 An aggrieved person is one who has a real interest in having a trade mark removed from the Register, or one who would be appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense if the trade mark remained on the Register: Continental Liqueurs at 427; Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193-194; Kraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Foods Corporation (1996) 65 FCR 104 at 112-113."
Case699,cited,Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Limited v Mobileworld Communications Pty Limited (2004) 61 IPR 212,"Section 10 of the Act defines the expression ""deceptively similar"". The opposed mark must so nearly resemble the other mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion. The authorities dealing with the question of whether one trade mark is deceptively similar to another were reviewed by a Full Court of this Court in Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Limited v Mobileworld Communications Pty Limited (2004) 61 IPR 212 at [72]ff. 130 The Full Court in Crazy Ron's distilled five legal principles from the many authorities which have dealt with this subject. Their Honours were dealing with the question of deceptive similarity in the context of trade mark infringement but the same principles apply to the test of deceptive similarity in s 60 as it stood in May 2001. 131 It is unnecessary to set out the five principles stated in Crazy Ron's . It is sufficient to say that the marks are not to be judged by a side by side comparison; they are to be considered by their look and sound, with due allowance for imperfect recollection. The goods to which the marks are to be applied must be considered together with all the surrounding circumstances. 146 Those authorities, as well as authorities of Full Courts in CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited (2000) 52 IPR 42 and Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Limited [1999] FCA 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365, were discussed by the Full Court in Crazy Ron's at [80] [90]. 147 The effect of those authorities is that the enquiry is not as wide as would be undertaken in a passing off action or in a proceeding under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act . Rather, the search is to be concentrated on ascertaining the essential element of the mark and the impression taken away by one who looks at it and how it sounds when pronounced: Crazy Ron's at [86], [88]. 148 The essential element of the Inner Health Plus mark is not found in the words ""Health Plus"". Rather, as I have already said, the idea or essential feature of Inner Health Plus is that it is concerned with internal health. Health Plus embraces a different concept. 149 To the extent that any notoriety of Inner Health Plus is to be taken into account, consumers must be taken to be familiar with it as an improved and more convenient version of Inner Health powder: Crazy Ron's at [90]. 151 Furthermore, there is no tangible danger of deception or confusion: Crazy Ron's at [76]. The Inner Health Plus product and the goods encompassed by the Health Plus trade mark have their own separate attributes. They may be recommended by health professionals. Their purchase is likely to be a considered decision after close appraisal and consideration. Health professionals are usually careful to listen and ensure that their customers select the correct product."
Case700,referred to,de Cordova v Vick Chemical Co (1951) 68 RPC 103,I do not consider that the Health Plus mark captures one of the essential features of the Inner Health Plus mark: c.f. Saville Perfumery Limited v June Perfect Limited (1941) 58 RPC 147; de Cordova v Vick Chemical Co (1951) 68 RPC 103 at 105-106.
Case701,considered,EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 277 ,"The power to order rectification under s 88 is expressed in discretionary terms. However, in EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 277 at 287, Branson J expressed the view that the terms of s 89 suggest that s 88(1) does not vest a true discretion in the Court. 204 In my opinion, there is force in Branson J's view because s 88(1) is subject to s 89, and s 89 confers a discretion, to be exercised in limited circumstances, not to grant an application for rectification. Nevertheless, this approach has not been taken in other courts: see eg. Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gymbaree Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 618 ; (2000) 100 FCR 166 at [97] ; Mayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited [2008] FCA 27 at [75] ."
Case702,applied,Fisher v Hebburn Limited [1960] HCA 80 ; (1960) 105 CLR 188,"As Fullagar J stated in Fisher v Hebburn Limited [1960] HCA 80 ; (1960) 105 CLR 188 at 194, a statute is, prima facie , to be construed as not attaching new legal consequences to facts or events which occurred before the commencement of the statute. 115 In my view, Shin-Sun's approach to statutory construction is correct, although more accurately it ought to be based on s 88(2)(a) as it stood when the rectification proceeding was commenced on 13 February 2006. On that date, s 88(2)(a) enlivened the power to order rectification of the register on ""any of the grounds on which registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under Division 2 of Part 5"". The pre-amendment form of s 88(2)(a) still requires s 60 to be applied as it stood when the trade mark was filed on 7 May 2001. The significance of applying the pre-amendment form rather than current form of s 88(2)(a) is that Health World is precluded from relying on the 'contrary to law' ground under s 42 (that provision not being found in Division 2 of Part 5). 116 For all these reasons, it follows, in my opinion, that the ground of opposition based upon deceptive similarity is to be determined under s 60 in its pre-amended form."
Case703,referred to,Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2005) 64 IPR 495,In December 2001 Health World filed notice of opposition to the Health Plus trade mark relying inter alia on the ground contained in s 60. The Registrar of Trade Marks dismissed the opposition but Health World appealed to the Federal Court under s 56 of the Act. The appeal was heard by Cooper J. His Honour determined the appeal adversely to Health World: see Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2005) 64 IPR 495.
Case704,referred to,Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 647 ,"The present proceedings are, of course, not an appeal from Cooper J. Nor is Health World estopped from asserting that the Health Plus mark was deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus trade mark at 7 May 2001, even though Cooper J found on the balance of probabilities that the Health Plus mark was not deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus mark as at that date: see Health World v Shin-Sun (per Cooper J) at [6], [41]; Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 647. 11 The proceedings before me consist of three separate applications. In the first, Health World seeks expungement of the Health Plus mark under ss 88(2)(a) and (c) of the Act. This proceeding is sometimes referred to as the rectification proceeding. 12 Section 88(2)(a) provides that an application for cancellation or removal of a mark may be made on any of the grounds on which the registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under the Act. The grounds on which Health World relies in the rectification proceeding are those contained in ss 42 , 59 and 60 . 96 Indeed, the entire thrust of Health World's launch of the Inner Health Plus capsules was to take advantage of the reputation of the Inner Health Powder and the goodwill attaching to it. This is graphically revealed in Mr Joiner's evidence in the proceedings before Cooper J, as put to Mr Joiner by counsel for Shin Sun in cross-examination in the present proceedings. The relevant passage is as follows: I did not want to discontinue the Inner Health line as it had been and was still a successful product. I believed that the fact that Inner Health was an established product in its field gave Health World an excellent opportunity to introduce a new type of probiotic product similar to the existing Inner Health product but in an improved version which could be launched onto the market. My plan was to take advantage of the goodwill which had already been built up in the Inner Health brand. 97 I understood Mr Joiner to accept the accuracy of this evidence when it was put to him in cross-examination before me. In any event, its accuracy is fully supported by the promotional and advertising material referred to above. 98 It is true that when Inner Health Plus capsules were introduced they contained bifidobacteria which were not an ingredient of Inner Health powder at that time. But that does not distinguish the reputation of Inner Health Plus from its predecessor. 110 Second, this approach to construction is consistent with the scheme of the Act as discussed by a Full Court in Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2003] AIPC 91-839 at [18]. The Full Court there observed that opposition proceedings are quasi-summary and an unsuccessful opponent will have the opportunity to bring an expungement application if the opposition proceeding fails: see also the authorities to which I referred in Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 647 at [27] , [36], [40], and [41]."

Case708,applied,Maxwell v Murphy [1957] HCA 7 ; (1957) 96 CLR 261 ,"Moreover, the general rule of the common law is that, subject to any contrary intention appearing with reasonable certainty, a statute changing the law is not to be understood as applying to facts that have already occurred so as to confer or otherwise affect rights or liabilities which the law has defined by reference to past events: Maxwell v Murphy [1957] HCA 7 ; (1957) 96 CLR 261 at 267 per Dixon CJ."
Case709,referred to,Mayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited [2008] FCA 27,"In my opinion, there is force in Branson J's view because s 88(1) is subject to s 89, and s 89 confers a discretion, to be exercised in limited circumstances, not to grant an application for rectification. Nevertheless, this approach has not been taken in other courts: see eg.

Case710,applied,New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Limited [1990] HCA 60 ; (1990) 171 CLR 363,"As to the exercise of discretion under s 88(1), the guiding principles would seem to be those that were referred to in the authorities under the 1955 Act. The principal factors would therefore seem to be the public interest and the respective contributions made by the parties to the proceedings in creating the likelihood that the use of the registered mark would deceive or cause confusion: New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Limited [1990] HCA 60 ; (1990) 171 CLR 363 at 391 per Brennan J. 208 In my view, these factors point against the exercise of the discretion so that even if I may withhold relief under s 88(1), I would not exercise my discretion to do so. In short, it seems to me that the public interest is better served by expunging a mark that has become deceptive in the circumstances of this case. 209 Even though I am satisfied that Health World has made out the grounds for rectification under s 88(2)(a) (the s 59 ground) and s 88(2)(c), in my view it does not have standing to seek the relief because it is not an aggrieved person. 210 As I said above, I do not consider that Health World has any genuine desire to use the Health Plus mark. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that it has a real interest in having the Health Plus mark removed. Nor would it be appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense if the mark remains on the register. 211 By reason of my findings on the questions of the reputation of Inner Health Plus and deceptive similarity, I reject the claims of contravention of the Trade Practices Act and passing off against both Shin-Sun and Nature's Hive."
Case711,applied,Philip Morris Products SA v Sean Ngu [2002] ATMO 96,"However, there is authority for the proposition that where an applicant for registration has been put on notice that its intention to use the mark was in issue, and has not responded to the opponent's evidence, a finding of lack of intention may be made: Philip Morris Products SA v Sean Ngu [2002] ATMO 96 ; Tommy Hilfiger Licensing Inc v Tan (2002) 60 IPR 137; Shanahan at [11.110]."
Case712,applied,Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670 ,"In Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670 at 686, Aickin J recognised that a mark may be used to indicate a connection with an unidentified person. His Honour said that in those circumstances it must indicate a connection with both the proprietor and the user. 188 In my opinion, that requirement is not satisfied as a matter of fact because the evidence does not demonstrate any connection between the actual use of the mark and the registered proprietor, Shin-Sun. 189 Nevertheless, Shin-Sun contends that s 88(2)(c) is not enlivened because Nature's Hive's use of the mark was under the control of Shin-Sun so that Nature's Hive was an ""authorised user"" within the meaning of s 8(1) of the Act. 191 However, s 8(3) and s 8(4) do not limit the meaning of the expression ""under the control of"" the owner of the trade mark in s 8(1): see s 8(5). It is therefore necessary to deal with the question of whether Shin-Sun exercised quality or financial control over Nature's Hive's use of the mark, or whether it controlled the use in the broad sense referred to by Aickin J in Pioneer at 683. 192 There is no evidence before me that Shin-Sun has exercised quality control over the Health Plus products manufactured for Nature's Hive and supplied under Nature's Hive's packaging. 193 Indeed, in my view, the evidence establishes that Nature's Hive has the relevant obligations of quality control under the Therapeutic Goods Act . Nature's Hive is the sponsor and the certificate of listing for the goods imposes the obligation of quality control on Nature's Hive. 200 The ""control"" which is contemplated by s 8(5) would seem to be as wide as the ""connection in the course of trade"" to which Aickin J referred in Pioneer at 683. His Honour said that the connection may be slight, such as selection or quality control or control of the user in the sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary: see also Henschke at [70]. 201 However, Aickin J observed in Pioneer at 683 that it is essential that the user maintains the connection of the registered proprietor with the goods. That connection is not established on the facts of the present case. 202 It follows in my view that Nature's Hive was not an authorised user of the mark. It also follows that the use of the Health Plus trade mark was likely to deceive or cause confusion within the meaning of s 88(2)(c) of the Act."
Case713,applied,Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Limited [1999] FCA 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 ,"Those authorities, as well as authorities of Full Courts in CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited (2000) 52 IPR 42 and Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Limited [1999] FCA 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365, were discussed by the Full Court in Crazy Ron's at [80] [90]. 152 Under s 60 in its pre-amended form, a finding of deceptive similarity was a pre-condition for the Court to go on to consider the test set out in s 60(b): Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths at [82]. It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider that test. 153 Under the amended form of the section it would be necessary to consider that question because a finding of deceptive similarity is no longer a pre-requisite. However, even if the amended form of the section applies, Health World would not succeed in its application for rectification on this ground. 154 Section 60(a) as amended would be enlivened because Inner Health Plus had acquired the necessary reputation. But the causal link required under s 60(b) would not be made out. This is because the reputation of Inner Health Plus was that of a more potent and convenient form of Inner Health powder."
Case714,referred to,Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Limited (1986) 12 FCR 477,"Nor do I accept that the letter of 4 April 2007 from Shin-Sun's solicitors constitutes an admission that the marks are deceptively similar. It is well settled that the issue of deceptive similarity is for the Court itself to decide: Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Limited (1986) 12 FCR 477 at 487-488, referred to by Cooper J in Health World v Shin-Sun (2005) at [33]."
Case715,referred to,Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 ,"An aggrieved person is one who has a real interest in having a trade mark removed from the Register, or one who would be appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense if the trade mark remained on the Register: Continental Liqueurs at 427; Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193-194; Kraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Foods Corporation (1996) 65 FCR 104 at 112-113. 160 In my view, the intention, or lack thereof, to which s 59 is directed, is a ""real and definite intention"" of the applicant for registration, to use the mark publicly as a trade mark, although it is not necessary that the intention be immediate or within a limited time: Ritz Hotel at 202-203. 161 The subjective nature of the intention, the presumption of intention flowing from the application for registration and the onus on an opponent usually make it difficult for an opposition, or an application for rectification, to succeed on this ground: see Shanahan at [2.120], [11.110]; Dufty A &amp; Lahore J, Lahore, Patents Trade Marks &amp; Related Rights (LexisNexis Butterworths, 2006) at [55,580]. 169 Indeed, the effect of Mr Shin's evidence was that ""we wanted to widen our business"" to use the mark on any products which Shin-Sun might make. This does not satisfy the test stated in the authorities to which McLelland J referred in the Ritz Hotel case at 202-203. 170 Ms Shin, in her affidavit of 20 December 2006, stated that Shin-Sun conceived the Health Plus mark and that she had taken certain steps on behalf of that company which were consistent with an intention, as at 7 May 2001, for Shin-Sun to use the mark. 171 However, the overall effect of her evidence was that she failed to distinguish between the two separate corporate entities, Shin-Sun and Nature's Hive. I cannot be satisfied, and I find that she did not pay attention to which corporation she was representing when she took the steps that she relies upon to support the assertion that Shin-Sun intended to use the mark. 223 Section 101(3) confers a broad discretion on the Court: Henschke at [72]. The discretion is conferred so as to give the Court a sufficient degree of flexibility to give effect to public interest considerations: Ritz Hotel at 221-225."

In Unilever Australia Limited v Karounos [2001] FCA 1132 ; (2001) 52 IPR 361 at [13] , Hill J said that under this sub-section: The court is required to consider the question as at the time of registration and determine whether as at that time it was proper for the registrar to admit the mark to the register. Facts subsequent to the date of registration will be irrelevant. 109 Other authorities to the same effect are referred to in Davison M, Johnston K, Kennedy P , Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off , (3 rd ed , Thomson Lawbook Co, 2003) at [14.175] n 127."
Case721,discussed,Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36,"On 3 February 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment concerning the applicant's motion for default judgment and made the orders that Mr Armitage now seeks to have set aside: see Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 ("" Wu ""). 6 In Wu , I considered (at [6]-[25]) the extensive history of delay and non-compliance with the Court's orders by the first and second respondents. I found (at [52]-[53]) that the first and second respondents had failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence and were in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules. My reasons for judgment record that: &#8226; The applicant (hereafter referred to as Ms Wu) was required to bring an application to the Court for an order for substituted service as regards Mr Armitage ([7]-[8]). &#8226; Ms Wu applied twice by motion for orders that the respondents, including Mr Armitage, provide their lists of documents and the respondents, including Mr Armitage, breached orders of 8 October 2003 and 16 December 2003 for the provision of these lists ([10]-[13]). From September 2003 until 14 April 2004, Mr Armitage and the other respondents retained a solicitor (Mr Joseph Guss) ([8] and [15]). &#8226; Mr Armitage failed to make documents available for inspection, despite orders by the Court on 8 October 2003, 16 December 2003 and 9 June 2004 ([10]-[17]). Following an order for further discovery on 4 March 2004, Mr Armitage filed an affidavit stating that the first respondent's accounts and statutory records were ""mistakenly removed by a waste paper removalist with various other papers and records"" and that he was unable to locate his file in respect of Ms Wu's application for an Australian visa and her alleged investment in the first respondent ([14]). &#8226; After 14 April 2004, Ms Wu's solicitor's attempted to contact the respondents, including Mr Armitage directly. By a letter dated 21 April 2004, Mr Armitage informed Ms Wu's solicitors that he was ""unable to facilitate"" the inspection of the discovered documents because they were ""located at the office of Joseph Guss"" ([15]). &#8226; On the first occasion when Ms Wu's motion for default judgment came on for hearing, counsel appeared for Mr Armitage. Counsel advised that she was instructed by solicitors who expected to act in the matter. This expectation was not fulfilled ([17]). &#8226; On the second occasion when Ms Wu's motion for default judgment came on for hearing, different counsel appeared for Mr Armitage. Counsel advised that he was instructed by solicitors, who subsequently advised the Court that they were no longer retained to act for Mr Armitage (or any other respondent) in the proceeding ([19]). &#8226; Although it was made clear in court on 13 October 2004 that it was open to the respondents to serve a subpoena on their previous solicitor (Mr Guss) to produce the discovered documents to the Court the respondents did not take steps to do this until 3 December 2004 ([19] and [21]). &#8226; On 3 December 2004, George Liberogiannis and Associates went on record as solicitor for the Armitages, including Barry Armitage. Mr Liberogiannis did not, however, appear on the return of the subpoena. The subpoena was not discharged against Mr Guss until 16 February 2005 ([21]-[22]). &#8226; At the adjourned hearing of the motion for default judgment on 27 April 2005, Mr Liberogiannis sought leave to withdraw as the solicitor on the record. His evidence was that Barry Armitage and his son had failed to keep appointments with counsel and to provide him with instructions for the conduct of the matter, notwithstanding his numerous calls to their cell phones and place of residence. His firm filed a notice of ceasing to act for Barry Armitage and his son on 28 April 2005 ([24]). 7 Notwithstanding this, for the reasons stated in Wu at [54] and following, I declined to make orders in terms of the motion for default judgment. At [54]-[55], I said: ""I would not order that judgment be entered without more because, following the return of the subpoena directed to Mr Guss, there remains no continuing and unexplained default on the respondents' part. If Barry Armitage's evidence is accepted, there is nothing more the respondents can do to facilitate inspection of documents. Although Mr Guss did not produce all of the documents the subject of the subpoena, Barry Armitage has affirmed that the remaining documents remain in Mr Guss' custody. Ultimately, the credibility (or lack thereof) of Barry Armitage's claims regarding these and like matters will be an issue for trial: see Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 66 at [33] per Nicholson J. Whether he is believed or not is likely to have other consequences for this litigation. I note too that there may be circumstances that partly explain the delays. These circumstances include the ill health of Barry Armitage and of a family member and the disturbance caused by changes in legal representation. Moreover, although the respondents have needed repeated prompting by Ms Wu's solicitor, they have filed their defence, various affidavits responding to Ms Wu's claims and lists of discoverable documents. They have mostly participated in court hearings and they were represented at the mediation by their solicitor. Barry Armitage ultimately took steps to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, in order that Ms Wu have access to the first and second respondents' discovered documents."" 10 Mr Armitage's earlier affidavits, the affidavits of the third and fourth respondents and Ms Saldaneri are mentioned in Wu at [27] and [31]. Mr Armitage's lengthy affidavit of 16 May 2006 deposes to matters of fact. It also contains what are in truth submissions on his motion. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that Mr Armitage claimed (amongst other things): &#8226; Mr Armitage was unable to collect his documents relating to this matter from previously retained counsel (Mr Dennis Baker) until 4 May 2006. He had not previously seen some of these documents. &#8226; Prior to the hearing on 27 April 2005, Mr Armitage had no knowledge of the affidavit of Anna Maria Krycer of 12 April 2005; that Mr Lieberogiannis intended to seek leave to withdraw from the proceeding; and that he would be unrepresented at that hearing. He claimed that he was denied an opportunity to respond to Ms Krycer's affidavit and Mr Lieberogiannis' evidence. &#8226; After receiving a copy of the 27 April 2005 order (granting leave to Mr Lieberogiannis to cease to act) Mr Armitage asked Registry ""what was happening with the proceedings"" and was told that ""no other date had been appointed, and that it appeared that there was no further action or procedure contemplated"". He returned to the Registry on two further occasions. He assumed the action was not proceeding. &#8226; When the respondents retained Mr Guss, they gave Mr Guss all relevant documents and did not retain any copies. In early April 2004, there was a dispute between Mr Guss and Mr Armitage (and other respondents), as a consequence of which Mr Guss ceased to act for them. Mr Guss claimed a lien over the respondents' documents. Mr Armitage photocopied the documents on the Court file. &#8226; After Mr Guss ceased to act, the respondents decided to draft instructions, affidavits and other documents needed in the proceeding and to engage counsel ""to finalise documents and make any necessary Court appearances"". Ultimately, a barrister's clerk ""agreed to arrange for solicitors (not then known to the Respondents) to provide the 'Back Sheets' required to brief counsel"". Mr Armitage added: ""In practice, the arrangement ... did not provide a proper level of legal services and ... Mr Baker agreed to provide a 'budget-type' representation for the Respondents."" &#8226; Mr Liberogiannis agreed to act as solicitor on the record, ""with the Respondents providing all secretarial-type support, full written instructions, and the like"". Mr Baker agreed to supervise the work and retain the documents relevant to the proceeding. Mr Baker therefore held all relevant documents and the respondents retained no copies. &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son (the third respondent) attended Mr Baker's chambers frequently, ""often on two occasions a week"". Mr Armitage deposed: ""In the period leading up to 27 April 2005 I was aware that the matter was to come back before the Court fairly soon, but I was not aware of the nature of the anticipated proceedings."" &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son were unable to keep an arrangement to meet Mr Baker on 22 April 2005 and left a message that they would attend on 26 April 2005. They did not attend Mr Baker's chambers on 26 April 2005 because their car ""broke down in the countryside"" and they did not contact Mr Baker because ""we were in an area of poor mobile telephone reception"". &#8226; Mr Armitage did not find out about the 27 April hearing until after the scheduled time of the hearing. He added that ""[w]e immediately tried to contact Mr Baker and he told us we should speak to Mr Liberogiannis"". &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son made unsuccessful attempts to contact Mr Liberogiannis, whom he ultimately met ""by chance"" early this year. &#8226; Hereafter, the respondents intended to act on their own behalf and ""to retain full control and ensure that all matters requiring attention are dealt with promptly"". &#8226; Mr Armitage had severe health problems and associated difficulties, including inability to give ""sustained personal attention to ... this litigation"". &#8226; Mr Armitage resigned as director of the first respondent because it could be insolvent. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not intentionally avoid service of the documents initiating this proceeding. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not attend court because of his health, the fact he had legal representation, and because Ms Wu, through her solicitors, had threatened him. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not become aware of Ms Wu's desire to inspect the discovered documents until he received a letter dated 20 April 2004 from her solicitors. He responded the next day. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not become aware until late November or early December 2004 that the Court had indicated that it would give leave to issue a subpoena to Mr Guss to obtain the documents for Ms Wu's inspection. He claimed that Mr Guss still held relevant documents. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not know that Mr Liberogiannis had failed to attend on the return of the subpoena. He did not knowingly breach any order of the Court. He ""should not be held responsible for ... delays ... during the time"" when Mr Guss and Mr Liberogiannis acted for him. 11 In addition, Mr Armitage challenged the reliability of the evidence of Ms Xia but it is unnecessary to provide the details of that challenge here. He also expanded on his claim that the initiating application and statement of claim in the proceeding were ""based on a serious fraud and constitutes an abuse of the processes of this ... Court"". He asserted that Ms Wu had made fraudulent claims in relation to her migration objective and investment claims. He responded to Ms Wu's claims against him at some length and alleged that her former and present solicitors had acted improperly in various ways. It is unnecessary to set out the details of these various allegations here. 12 In his affidavit of 16 May 2006, Mr Armitage further contended that the costs order of 3 February 2006 was unjust. This was because the primary matter in dispute had been the production of documents, over which he had no control. Also, so he said, Ms Wu's claims were fraudulent and, if he were required to meet the costs order before the determination of the proceeding, he would be prevented from defending himself. Mr Armitage specifically noted that paragraphs 36 and 38 of the statement of claim alleged that he acted dishonesty."

Case723,referred to,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Black on White Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 363,"Counsel for Ms Wu opposed Mr Armitage's motion, noting that Mr Armitage was represented by counsel on the hearing of Ms Wu's motion on two occasions when the motion was part heard. It was only on the third and final occasion, when the hearing of the motion was completed, that Mr Armitage's solicitor obtained leave to withdraw. Counsel submitted that the relevant principles were contained in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Black on White Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 363 ("" Black on White "") and Microsoft Corporation v Crosslink Marketing Group [2005] FCA 1817 at [21] . He argued that there were no exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify setting aside the orders in question. In this regard, he pointed out that Mr Armitage was heard, through his counsel, on the motion on two occasions and the affidavit material on which he relied was before the Court. The fact that his solicitor ""went off the record"" on 27 April 2005 ""did not make any difference to the Orders"". Further, counsel submitted that, having regard to the contents of Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006, it is not reasonably probable that he would have obtained orders other than the orders made on 3 February 2006 had that affidavit been before the Court. Finally, Mr Armitage's affidavit did not, so counsel submitted, establish fraudulent conduct and satisfy the requisite tests for setting aside on the ground of fraud. 25 Some care must be taken in dealing with the authorities that concern the setting aside of judgment or orders. The force of judicial observations in this area depends on the circumstances in which application to set aside is made, including whether the judgment or order has been entered or is final or interlocutory. For present purposes, it suffices to refer to the observations of the Full Court in Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 552 that the jurisdiction to set aside orders made after they have been entered is ""exceptional"": see also Black on White at [14]-[16]."

Case725,referred to,Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423,"First, I accept that the orders made on 3 February 2006 were interlocutory in nature. ""[A]n order made in the course of an action or suit which does not conclude the rights of the parties inter se, although it may, of course conclude the fate of the particular application in which it is made, is interlocutory only"": Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 440 per Taylor J. It is open to Mr Armitage to call in aid O 35 r 7(2)(c). 23 Secondly, I accept that Mr Armitage was not in court when the relevant orders were made on 3 February 2006 and that he was absent from a part of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion. That is, Mr Armitage was represented by his counsel at the hearing of the motion on 23 August and 13 October 2004, but was effectively unrepresented at the hearing on 27 April 2005, when his solicitor successfully obtained leave to withdraw. Accordingly, it is open to Mr Armitage to call in aid O 35 r 7(2)(a)."
Case726,referred to,Monroe Schneider Associates (Inc) v No 1 Raberem Pty Ltd (No 2) (1992) 37 FCR 234,"Thirdly, although Mr Armitage sought also to rely on O 35 r 7(2)(b), he has not adduced sufficient evidence to make out a case that the order was obtained by fraud. Plainly, any allegation of fraud is extremely serious. Before an order can be set aside on the ground of fraud, there must be sufficient evidence of the facts that establish the alleged fraudulent conduct and the part played by the party having the benefit the order. The fraudulent conduct must be ""directly material"" to the order and the evidence of the fraud must be evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered with reasonable and proper diligence before the order under challenge was made: see Monroe Schneider Associates (Inc) v No 1 Raberem Pty Ltd (No 2) (1992) 37 FCR 234 at 242. Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006 did not satisfy these requirements. Accordingly, it is not open to him to rely on O 35 r 7(2)(b)."

Case728,referred to,"KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung ("" KM &amp; A Chadwick "") [1995] FCA 354","Mr Armitage stated on oath that the respondents made the arrangements that led to the retainer of legal representatives, who knew little or nothing of their case and took little or no responsibility for its ongoing conduct. This impeded the proper conduct of the litigation, as Mr Armitage apparently concedes. Parties to litigation such as Mr Armitage are obliged to take steps to keep themselves informed of the conduct of the litigation by their appointed legal representatives. They cannot escape their responsibility as parties with respect to the conduct of the litigation by hiding behind a poorly instructed lawyer retained briefly or at the last minute. Nor can they excuse themselves by relying on a series of ""unfortunate events"", as Mr Armitage sought to do. If it were otherwise, case management would prove virtually impossible: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354 ("" KM &amp; A Chadwick "") at [15] per Tamberlin J. 35 Ms Wu has, moreover, proceeded to the taxation contemplated by the orders in question, as indeed she was entitled to do. In so doing she has incurred further costs. In this regard, I note, however, that Mr Armitage has been most assiduous in contesting the taxation. His notice of appeal, which was filed on 24 February 2006, preceded the taxation hearings. 36 I am satisfied, however, that, taken as a whole, the circumstances are such as to justify me setting aside pars [2] and [3] the orders made on 3 February 2006: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick . 37 I would set aside par [3] of my orders principally because it was made in Mr Armitage's absence from the final stages of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion and costs application and will apparently operate to prevent Mr Armitage, who swears that he is impecunious, from advancing his defence. Having regard to the serious nature of some of the claims made against him and to the fact that he has apparently an arguable defence, it would not be in the interests of justice to make an order with such a result. That Ms Wu will suffer some inconvenience or hardship as a result is unavoidable. It is impossible to reconcile Ms Wu's interest in having the benefit of the orders previously with Mr Armitage's interest in having an opportunity to advance his defence. 38 For essentially the same reasons, I would also set aside par [2] of the 3 February orders. For the reasons set out below, I would order instead that, after judgment in this proceeding, Mr Armitage pay, on an indemnity basis, costs in the amount of $26,666.02 in respect of Ms Wu's motion. Further, I would order that Mr Armitage pay Ms Wu's costs of his motion. As will be seen below, although Mr Armitage has been partially successful in his motion, the need for such a motion arose from his failure to keep himself informed of the conduct of the proceeding on his behalf."
Case729,cited,Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225,"The power of the Court to make an order for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Costs ordinarily follow the event and are awarded on a party-party basis, unless there are particular or special circumstances which warrant the Court departing from this practice and making some other order: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 ("" Colgate-Palmolive "") at 232-233 per Sheppard J and Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J. Since Ms Wu was in substance successful, she was and remains entitled to an order for costs. She continues to submit that an indemnity costs order is appropriate. 42 Whilst the Court has power to make an order for costs on an indemnity basis, the question is whether the Court should so exercise its discretion in the particular case.

Specifically, it was held that the facts pleaded did not establish that when, in December 2005 and February 2006, the respondent announced a decision to transfer four Airbuses to Jetstar late in 2006 and early in 2007 and that those aircraft would not be crewed by its employees, it had thereby injured or prejudicially changed the position of particular employees or threatened to do either or both of these things. 8 The relevant legislation is set out in my earlier reasons: see [2006] FCA 1441 at [4] to [7]. 9 The respondent raises many complaints about the amended pleading. They may be summarised as follows: &#8226; No new material facts are pleaded which could support the allegation that the respondent had contravened s 298K(1)(b) and/or (c) on or before 27 March 2006. &#8226; Some conduct by the respondent which is said to be directed to the implementation of the December 2005 decision such as the transfer of the aircraft and the loss of remuneration and leave entitlements occurred after 27 March 2006 and yet is relied on to support alleged contraventions of s 298K. &#8226; The amended pleading is incomprehensible and embarrassing. This is because, in para 31B, the applicant contends that the making and communication of the 2005 decision (which occurred before 27 March 2006) and the steps taken to implement it (which occurred after 27 March 2006) constituted the relevant injury and/or alteration to prejudice. A reason (the pre 27 March 2006 requirement) for the respondent's impugned conduct is said to be that the pilots were entitled to the benefit of the enterprise bargaining agreement (para 32). Although para 32 covers conduct occurring both before and after 27 March 2006, para 32A pleads that ""in the premises"" the respondent has contravened s 298K. Paragraph 32B then pleads, in the alternative, that the sole or dominant reason (the post 27 March 2006 requirement) for the respondent's impugned conduct was that the pilots had the benefit of the enterprise bargaining agreement. Paragraph 32C pleads that ""in the premises"" the respondent has, since 27 March 2006, contravened s 792(1) of the amended Act . The respondent complains that, by pleading its case in this way, the applicant has merged the separate causes of action provided for in ss 298K and 792 thereby creating confusion such that the respondent is unable to comprehend the case it is called upon to meet or plead to it. 10 The applicant sought to meet these objections by pointing to the amendment to para 31B which now includes a reference to the ""implementation"" of the decision. Most of the steps which it is said were taken as part of the implementation process were alleged to have occurred prior to 27 March 2006. The steps relied on by counsel for the applicant which occurred at this time were: &#8226; The respondent's decision that Jetstar would upgrade its air operator certificate so it could operate wide bodied long haul aircraft: para 19. &#8226; The negotiations in December 2005 and 2006 with the Jetstar pilots' counsel to introduce terms and conditions of employment which would apply to Jetstar pilots involved in long haul flying: para 21. &#8226; The respondent's refusal to permit the applicant to participate in those negotiations: para 20. &#8226; The respondent's refusal, on or about 10 February 2006, to entertain negotiations with the applicant for alternative terms and conditions of employment upon which the Airbus fleet pilots would carry out the work on the four aircraft allocated to Jetstar: para 25A. &#8226; The variation, on or about 10 March 2006, of the Jetstar agreement as a consequence of agreement reached in negotiations: paras 23 and 24. The steps taken after 27 March 2006 which are relied on were the transfer of the three aircraft in October and November 2006: paras 25I, 25J and 25K."
Case740,cited,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"Under the error of law ground it is said that the Minister made findings of fact not supported by evidence. These are set out in Annexure 1. It should be noted that there is no ground under s 5 of the ADJR Act which explicitly authorises judicial review on the basis of findings of fact ""not supported by the evidence"". That ground appears to be wider than the ""no evidence"" ground in s 5(1)(h). In this case, however, the relevant particular appears to be relied upon to support a finding that the Minister erred in law. In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321, Mason CJ discussed the relationship between error of law contemplated by s 5(1)(f) of the ADJR Act and the ""no evidence"" ground referred to in s 5(1)(h) as elucidated in s 5(3). He said (at 358): The better view, one which seeks to harmonize the two grounds of review, is to treat ""error of law"" in s 5(1)(f) as embracing the ""no evidence"" ground as it was accepted and applied in Australia before the enactment of the AD(JR) Act and to treat the ""no evidence"" ground in s 5(1)(h), as elucidated in s 5(3), as expanding that ground of review in the applications for which pars (a) and (b) of s 5(3) make provision. Within the area of operation of par (a) it is enough to show an absence of evidence or material from which the decision-maker could reasonably be satisfied that the particular matter was established, that being a lesser burden than that of showing an absence of evidence (or material) to support the decision. The lengthy list of findings set out in Annexure 1 to the statement of claim gives rise to concern that this judicial review process may slide into merits review if not confined to its proper area. It is, however, too early in the proceedings to make any definitive observation in that regard. 10 It is, as counsel for the applicant suggests, open to the Court to give directions that the matter proceed on pleadings. I am not however convinced that this is a necessary course. The judicial review challenge is based upon the Minister's findings. Much of the statement of claim would not appear to be contentious as to background facts. It asserts legal duties and errors but a defence would not sharpen the issues in that respect. The question whether there was or was not evidence to support the findings referred to in Annexure 1 is not a question the resolution of which will be assisted by the filing of a defence. I am prepared to let the applicant's statement of claim stand as a statement of its case. Otherwise, in my opinion, the matter should proceed by way of affidavit and written submissions which may include the provision by the respondent of schedules identifying, in answer to Annexure 1, the evidence said to be supportive of the findings of fact there mentioned and in respect of Annexure 2, the material, if any, relied upon to show that the relevant matters there listed were, if mandatory relevant considerations, taken into account. 11 On the matter of discovery, having regard to the materials which have been disclosed, namely those set out in the Minister's reasons for decision, I see no utility in making any order for general discovery. Phosphate, however, submits that the Minister ought to discover: 1. Documentary material relevant to show what he did and read as his """"consideration"" in a real sense and undertaking an active intellectual process"" of the material in the documents listed in [28] of the reasons. 2. Documentary material evidencing the time spent reading the documents. 3. If he relied upon information or summaries provided to him by his department, the documents containing the information or summaries provided."
Case741,referred to,NATL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 112 ,"extracting the text of s 424A(1) of the Act, Smith FM thereafter referred to NATL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 112 at [14] , where a Full Federal Court (Ryan, Finkelstein and Downes JJ) pointed out that the reference in s 424A to 'particulars of any information... does not require the provision of evidence' , and further that '[t] he test is whether an applicant is fairly informed of the information considered to be adverse' . Upon that basis, his Honour observed, ' [i] n some cases, the objects of the section might only be able to be met by the actual provision of a copy of the source documents for the Tribunal's information. For example, where the Tribunal proposes to draw information from the appearance of a document which can not adequately be described in particulars.' His Honour then went on to observe that the '... s 424A letter sufficiently identified particulars of the information gained from the Moscow Embassy, which was then used in its reasons...'. The ' gist ' of that information obtained by the Tribunal, as so described by his Honour, '... comprised details of a claimed employment, the fact that letters had been given to the Embassy in corroboration of that employment, and that Embassy staff ""had confirmed with the rector of the institute the claimed employment and position"" . His Honour concluded that the letter '... sufficiently identified the potential relevance of that information, being that it was inconsistent with the factual claims of the [appellant] to the Tribunal as to his employment in Armenia and that he was in hiding' , and that as further stated in that letter in conclusion, those 'inconsistencies have the potential to cast doubt on the credibility of your claims to have had problems with the Armenian authorities for political reasons' . His Honour therefore concluded that 'I am therefore not satisfied that the Tribunal was in breach of its obligations under s 424A ' ."

Case744,referred to,SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2004) 215 ALR 162,"should first be observed that the Tribunal, which was a respondent in the proceedings below, has not been named as a respondent in the notice of appeal. In the light of the High Court decision of SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; 215 ALR 162 at [43] , [91], [153] and [180], the Tribunal should be joined as a second respondent to the current proceedings. In the context of the present appeal, the appellant sought to tender his affidavit evidence of 17 July 2006; prior thereto, the appellant had failed to file any written submissions. The Minister indicated that there was no objection to the Court receiving the affidavit as constituting the appellant's submissions, but observed that if it were to be treated as evidence, it 'would be objected to'. The Minister went on to observe that the affidavit contained material that was not before the Court below or the Tribunal. I have received the affidavit to the extent that it may serve as submissions for the appellant. The principal features of the affidavit are as follows (using where appropriate the text of the affidavit): (i) his confirmation that his application for an Australian visa asserted that he 'was the Head of the Biology Department at Vanevan University'; (ii) his claim that 'the 16 th International Congress of Eye Research's Conference Co-ordinator wrote to [him] at the University on 5 August 2004'; (iii) 'the head of the Vanevan Institute wrote a letter on [his] behalf to the Australian Embassy in Moscow dated 11 August 2004 saying that [he] had been head of the [biology] department since 2000'; and (iv) '... the presiding member had been obliged to duly inform [him] of the information considered to be adverse'; The appellant made the further submission that '... the Tribunal's s 424A letter did not properly identify particulars of the information obtained from Moscow Embassy (as well as from other sources)', and that '[g]iven [the] importance of the issue I am of the view that the Tribunal was obliged to provide me not only with particulars of the information gained from Moscow but with the copies of letters mentioned in paragraph 2 of the Affidavit', and to do so for three reasons, which he formulated as follows: (i) '... the Tribunal made its own research. At 154 (CB) it was confirmed that the University does exist in Armenia. However the address of the University is entirely different'; (ii) '[a]ccording to one of the letters the presiding member relied on, the Vanevan University is located at 51/25 Pushkin Street, Yerevan 375002 Armenia' (a letter of 5 August 2004, marked annexure A, was attached to his affidavit); (iii) '[a]ccording to information obtained by the Tribunal, the said University is located in a different town (even in a different region) at 26 Miasnikyan Street, Town of Martuni, Gehgardunik Region, Armenia' (reference was thereupon made to what appears at page 154 of the Court Book)."
Case745,applied,SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214,"appellant submitted that '[f]urthermore if to accept the Minister's suggestion that the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision because it was not satisfied that I had been a PPA member given my alleged lack of knowledge of PPA, or [because] it ""was not satisfied by the copy of my membership card"", or [because] the Tribunal ""was troubled by the fact"" that I did not tell about the documents submitted to the Embassy early in the hearing, then it must be accepted that the Tribunal was in breach of s 424A of the Migration Act [because] it did not give me the opportunity to comment on this information.' The contention such as it was, is misconceived and without juridical foundation. The Minister submitted that those contentions made by the appellant regarding page seventeen of the Tribunal's judgment constituted 'a new section 424A case which was not put to the Federal Magistrate', in that the appellant contended that that information was not the subject of the section 424A notice provided to the appellant. The Minister pointed out rightly that those matters referred to by the appellant were all evaluations of evidence, not information within the meaning of s 424A of the Act. Reference was made by the Minister in that regard to the dictum of Allsop J in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [206] - [207] , where his Honour discussed what is encompassed by the statutory notion of information in the context of s 424A(1) of the Act. Allsop J observed as follows: 'Information does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations: Tin at [54], Paul at [95] and VAF at [24]. In this respect, it is relevant to recall the root of the word 'information': that of which one has been told or apprised, or informed. The distinction can become fine: Paul at [95]. It is a distinction, nevertheless, to be maintained. Also, the fact that appraisal, thought processes and determination are not information does not mean they are not relevant to the operation of s 424A. The thought processes of the Tribunal may reveal the relevance of information for s 424A(1)(b) and may assist in understanding what the Tribunal must say or do to comply with s 424A(1)(a) , (b) or (c).' In the light of the above authority, I am persuaded that Smith FM was correct to conclude in his decision below that the ' s 424A letter sufficiently identified particulars of the information gained from the Moscow Embassy, which was then used by the Tribunal in its reasons...'. The appellant concluded the case on appeal as follows: 'Moreover, even if to accept that in such circumstances the Tribunal was not in breach of s 424A of the Act, it is to be accepted that the Tribunal acted unfairly. And this unfairness is to be regarded as denial of procedural fairness and, itself the issue of apprehended bias.'"

However, it may be observed that because s 422B of the Act took effect in relation to the present proceedings, the natural justice hearing rule has no application beyond the textual requirements contained within that section of the Act. The Minister referred in that regard to the Full Court decision of SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62 (Heerey, Conti and Jacobson JJ), ' in which the decision of the same Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 was applied to find that section 422B excluded the common law natural justice hearing rule' ."

Case748,followed,Australian Broadcasting Commission v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199,turn to the second proceeding and the causes of action relied upon by the applicants. It is a well accepted principle that it is not open to me to grant an interlocutory injunction in the air in the absence of a cause of action to be adjudicated upon at trial. It was made clear in Australian Broadcasting Commission v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 that an interlocutory injunction should only be granted by a court in support of a known cause of action upon which the applicant for the interlocutory injunction wishes to rely at trial. The applicants relied upon the following causes of action: (a) The proposal by the Housing Associations to enter into the sub-leases constitutes oppressive conduct and conduct not in the interests of the members of the Housing Associations as a whole giving rise to causes of action under s 109 of the Associations Act and s 166 of the Aboriginal Corporations Act. The 40 year sub-leases were not in the interests of the members of the Housing Associations as a whole because the Associations were giving away their control of the management of the tenancies of the individual residents to the Commonwealth which was outside the objectives of each Housing Association. This control was being given away for $1 per year and there was no guarantee by the Minister that any part of the proposed expenditure of $100 million in respect of the town camps would be allocated to any particular or specific Housing Association. It was further submitted that the 40 year sub-leases did not protect the current rights of occupancy of the tenants under their tenancy agreements; (b) The constitutions of the Housing Associations constituted contracts with their members and the entry of the Housing Associations into the sub-leases would be contrary to the objectives of the Housing Associations and would therefore constitute a breach of their constitutions which the Minister was inducing; (c) The decision to enter into the 40 year sub-leases was ultra vires the Housing Associations; (d) The management committee of each Housing Association was in breach of the fiduciary duty they owed to the Association and its members by agreeing to enter into the sub-leases. (e) The entry by the Housing Associations into the sub-leases constituted a breach of contract as the sub-leases would constitute a breach of the individual tenancy agreements of the tenants of the Housing Associations; (f) The Minister was engaging in the tort of intimidation by unlawful means in that she was intimidating the Housing Associations to enter into the sub-leases when she had not accorded procedural fairness to the individual tenants; (g) Section 20CA of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act had not been complied with as the Housing Associations were required to make a request to the Minister to enter into the sub-leases but that request had to be voluntary. The requests made by the Housing Associations were not voluntary. In the circumstances as they developed in the course of the hearing I do not consider that it is necessary to reach a conclusion whether there is a serious question to be tried in relation to each of the causes of action relied upon by the applicants. I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried that if they now enter into the sub-leases the Housing Associations will not be acting in the interests of their members as a whole thereby giving rise to a cause of action under s 109 of the Associations Act and s 166 of the Aboriginal Corporations Act. Under their Constitutions the only way a person can become a member of the relevant Housing Association is if that person is a resident of the town camp which is situated on the land which is comprised in the perpetual lease or Crown Lease held by the Association.
Case749,followed,Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR 148,"is important to recognise that at this stage of both proceedings, as I am dealing with applications for interlocutory relief, I do not have to make any final determination in respect of the issues raised before the Court. Consistently with established authority I am required to determine whether there is a serious question to be tried in relation to the causes of action raised by the applicants in each proceeding. If I am so satisfied and am satisfied that the applicants will suffer irreparable harm in respect of which damages are not an adequate remedy if an injunction is not granted, it is then necessary to determine whether the balance of convenience favours the grant or refusal of the injunctive relief sought. I am therefore following and applying the process identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153: ""In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction."" Consideration of the first proceeding In relation to the first proceeding the applicants submitted that a breach of the rules of natural justice has occurred or is occurring or is likely to occur in connection with the proposal of the Minister to give the notice pursuant to s 47(1) of the NER Act. The tenants of the Housing Associations will be significantly affected by the proposed decision so that the Minister is obliged to observe the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness and ensure that the tenants are made aware of the manner in which their rights will be affected by the notice and are given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister as to whether or not she should give a notice before she finally makes a decision. The applicants submitted that the power conferred on the Minister by s 47 of the NER Act to issue a notice which had the effect of vesting all rights and interests in the land to which the notice related with the Commonwealth (see s 47(3)), was subject to a duty imposed upon the Minister to accord procedural fairness or natural justice to the applicants. It was submitted that that duty had not been observed in the present circumstances as the tenants had not been made fully aware of the consequence of the notice on their rights to occupy the land which they sub-leased from the Housing Associations and that they had not been given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister in respect of her proposal to give such a notice. The Minister submitted that the power given to the Minister pursuant to s 47 was not constrained by any obligation to accord natural justice or procedural fairness to the tenants whose rights would be affected, indeed extinguished, by the giving of a notice pursuant to s 47. The Minister acknowledged that generally one would expect that a power of the kind contained in s 47 would be subject to a duty to accord procedural fairness and that the Commonwealth's power to acquire land by compulsion contained in the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 (Cth) ("" Lands Acquisition Act "") was generally subject to an obligation to notify affected parties. The Minister then submitted that the NER Act was enacted with a view to a need to respond urgently to a national emergency and that s 47 was enacted as a separate power and that the usual procedural provisions in the Lands Acquisition Act were expressly put aside in relation to acquisitions under s 47. In this context the Minister referred to s 50(2) of the NER Act. The Minister submitted that s 50(1) and (2) of the NER Act excluded written and unwritten natural justice obligations. The Minister submitted that s 50(1) was an unambiguous statement that the s 47 power was not constrained, even by an unwritten law that might otherwise support an implication for a natural justice obligation. The Minister submitted that it was plain that the legislative expressly turned its mind to, and excluded, procedural fairness that was expressed in written law. I consider that there is a serious question to be tried that this is not the proper construction and effect of s 50. Put another way, I consider there is a serious question to be tried that the provisions of s 47 of the NER Act taken with the provisions of s 50 do not oust the obligation cast upon the Minister to accord natural justice or procedural fairness to the tenants who will be affected by the proposed notice. I consider it is arguable that s 50 is concerned with laws whether written or unwritten which are inconsistent with the provisions of Div 1 and Div 2 of the Act. I consider that it is clearly arguable that the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness are not inconsistent with the exercise of power to give a notice under s 47. As the applicants submitted, it is arguable that natural justice is an adjunct to the exercise of that power."
Case750,followed,Kioa v West (1985) 159 CLR 550,"is a well established principle that a statute will not be construed as excluding the operation of common law principles such as the obligation to accord natural justice or procedural fairness in appropriate circumstances unless there is a clear and unambiguous statement or inference to that effect to be extracted from the relevant legislation. In Kioa v West (1985) 159 CLR 550 Mason J said at 584 - 585: ""The law has now developed to a point where it may be accepted that there is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of according procedural fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights, interests and legitimate expectations, subject only to the clear manifestation of a contrary statutory intention. ... Where the decision in question is one for which provision is made by statute, the application and content of the doctrine of natural justice or the duty to act fairly depends to a large extent on the construction of the statute. In Mobil Oil Australia Pty. Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1) Kitto J. pointed out that the obligation to give a fair opportunity to parties in controversy to correct or contradict statements prejudicial to their view depends on 'the particular statutory framework'. What is appropriate in terms of natural justice depends on the circumstances of the case and they will include, inter alia, the nature of the inquiry, the subject-matter, and the rules under which the decision-maker is acting: Reg. v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ; Ex parte Angliss Group (2) ; National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd (3) . ... When the doctrine of natural justice or the duty to act fairly in its application to administrative decision-making is so understood, the need for a strong manifestation of contrary statutory intention in order for it to be excluded becomes apparent. The critical question in most cases is not whether the principles of natural justice apply. It is: what does the duty to act fairly require in the circumstances of the particular case? It will be convenient to consider at the outset whether the statute displaces the duty when the statute contains a specific provision to that effect, for then it will be pointless to inquire what the duty requires in the circumstances of the case, unless there are circumstances not contemplated by the statutory provision that may give rise to a legitimate expectation. However, in general, it will be a matter of determining what the duty to act fairly requires in the way of procedural fairness in the circumstances of the case. A resolution of that question calls for an examination of the statutory provisions and the interests which I have already mentioned."" With that background I consider that there is a serious question to be tried that the Minister has not accorded the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness at this point in time in relation to her proposal to give a notice under s 47. The proposal to give the s 47 notice was first raised or articulated clearly by the Minister in the letter of 24 May 2009. Prior to that time there had been numerous consultations and dialogue between the Minister and the representatives of the Housing Associations and the tenants but that was in relation to the proposal that the Housing Associations enter into 40 year sub-leases. Whether the Minister has accorded the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness in relation to her proposal to give a notice under s 47 is to be determined by her conduct and the conduct of her department on and after 24 May 2009. I consider there is a serious question to be tried that the media release, the letters sent by the Minister to the Council and to the Housing Associations, the meetings held subsequently with some of the tenants and other persons and the leaflet distributions have not been sufficient to discharge the Minister's obligation to bring to the attention of all the tenants the manner in which the proposed notice will affect their rights. There is also a serious question to be tried that they have not been given a proper opportunity to make submissions to the Minister. I am not satisfied that a process or procedure has been adopted whereby sufficient attempts were made to bring these matters to the attention of all the tenants. The evidence before me is insufficient to satisfy me that all the tenants have been given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister and have had fairly and squarely put before them the consequences of the Minister giving a notice pursuant to s 47. The leaflets do not make it clear that the tenants' rights to occupy their properties by way of sub-leases will be extinguished forever. Further, this was not made clear at the meeting on 29 June 2009 or in the leaflets that were distributed in the town camps. I accept the Minister's submission that the content of natural justice is to be determined by reference to the circumstances of the case: Kioa v West [supra]. In my view, there is a serious question to be tried that the content of the natural justice principle in the circumstances of this case requires that the tenants be told directly, and not indirectly through the Housing Associations or the Council, that a consequence of the giving of the notice is the extinguishment of their rights to occupy their houses. The Minister submitted that a decision to acquire land by compulsion might in the ordinary case be regarded as having grave consequences for a person holding an interest in the land but that in the present case the evidence disclosed that the practical effect of a decision by the Minister to acquire the land pursuant to s 47 was substantially different to the ordinary case. The Minister submitted that the reality was that there would only be a beneficial impact on the living conditions of the town camp inhabitants. The difficulty with that submission is that it ignores, or it does not take into account, the fact that there will be an extinguishment of tenants' rights of occupation of their houses. To submit, as the Minister did, that ""subject to new tenancy agreements being necessary, no other legal rights of the applicant or group members are impacted"", is to ignore the fact that enforceable rights are being replaced with an opportunity to negotiate a new tenancy agreement which opportunity depends upon agreement between two parties. The next inquiry to be made is whether the balance of convenience is in favour or against the grant of an injunction. I am satisfied that the balance of convenience is in favour of granting an injunction restraining the Minister from giving a notice pursuant to s 47 until such time as the Court can be satisfied that: (a) the tenants have been given clear and unambiguous information that if the notice is given their tenancy rights over the land they occupy pursuant to their sub-leases will be extinguished forever; and (b) the tenants have been given the opportunity to make submissions to the Minister after they have been given this information. I do not intend to prescribe the process which the Minister should undertake in order to discharge her obligations to accord the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness. What I am disposed to do is to grant an injunction restraining the Minister from giving a notice pursuant to s 47 until further order. Such an injunction will enable the Minister to take such steps as she may consider, or she may be advised, will bring to the attention of the tenants the consequences of the giving of the notice and will give them an opportunity to make submissions to her. The injunction will be cast in terms restraining the Minister from giving a notice until further order. It will not be cast in terms restraining the Minister from taking any steps in and towards the giving of the notice."

The manner in which a company is being administered and in which its affairs are conducted may fall within the category of conduct contrary to the interests of the company's members as a whole although it may not be described as oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against members of the company"" (Citations omitted) The Housing Associations have made it clear that the reason or, at least the main reason, why they propose to enter into 40 year sub-leases with the Director is to avoid the alternative of the Minister exercising power under s 47 of the NER Act to give notice which will have the effect of extinguishing forever the interests of the Housing Associations in the relevant pieces of land. The attitude of the Housing Associations on this issue was made abundantly clear in a letter from their solicitors to the Minister on 29 July 2009 which was, inter alia, in the following terms: ""As you know, and as we are now instructed to make clear, the Housing Associations are prepared to enter into the proposed 40 year subleases notwithstanding your rejection of their many requests for the inclusion of terms and conditions designed to further protect the ongoing interests of the Housing Associations, tenants and residents. The Housing Associations have agreed to enter into the subleases for the simple reason that you have threatened them with compulsory acquisition if they do not enter into the subleases. As you know, the loss of tenure to these lands is something that is abhorrent to the Housing Associations and they could not run the risk that it might occur. It is in the overriding best interests of the Associations and their members that their interests in these lands be maintained rather than completely foregone. Acquisitions of these land would not allow the Associations or members to have any input into protecting their rights or interests. Indeed, this ultimate risk of compulsory acquisition has hovered in the background throughout the protected negotiations. That risk was made abundantly clear when you issued notice that you were considering these compulsory acquisitions. Likewise, your letter to Tangentyere dated 24 July 2009 makes it perfectly clear that unless the subleases are entered into in the terms attached to your letter then you will proceed in relation to the potential compulsory acquisitions."" Counsel for the Housing Associations submitted that it was in the overriding best interests of the Housing Associations and the tenants of the Housing Associations to retain their perpetual leases and not to have their titles extinguished by compulsory acquisition. He submitted initially that the Housing Associations were prepared to grant the sub-leases to the Director for two reasons. Firstly, because it appeared that it was the only way that Commonwealth funding would be provided. Secondly, because it was the only way to avoid compulsory acquisition."

Case757,referred to,Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd (2008) 169 FCR 227,"Ms Collins then submitted that a balancing exercise was involved, essentially between the forensic significance of the material and the harm that would be done to the public good by disclosure.

Case758,followed,Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1,"Ms Collins then submitted that a balancing exercise was involved, essentially between the forensic significance of the material and the harm that would be done to the public good by disclosure. In essence, Mr Halley accepted that proposition the correctness of which is borne out by a recent judgment of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Limited (2008) 169 FCR 227 at 232 [22].

Ms Collins then submitted that I should take into account the clear relevance of the material to the present proceedings. She submitted that the relevance was plain from the terms of the notice to produce. The notice to produce was in the following terms: 1. All documents provided to Mr David McGuinness on or before 10 October 2008 in relation to the decision or opinion recorded in the letter from Ms Dodds and Mr Astar to Atanaskovic Hartnell dated 10 October 2008 that it will not be possible for the First, Second and Third Applicants to have the same legal representatives, or different representatives each from Atanaskovic Hartnell, at their examinations under section 19 of the ASIC Act ("" the Decision ""). 2. All documents provided to Mr McGuinness in relation to the Reasons for the Decision pursuant to s.13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act Re: Legal Representation of Mr Collard, Ms Li and Ms Zeng at their Examinations pursuant to s.19 of the ASIC Act signed by him and dated 22 October 2008. ASIC produced MFI 1 in answer to both paragraphs of that notice to produce. In Ms Collins' submission, it followed that the relevance of the material was established. 11 Mr Halley submitted, broadly speaking, that perhaps not that much could be gleaned from production, particularly where the issues in the proceedings were effectively about whether a particular administrative decision should be set aside. I approach the matter on the basis that the documents are relevant. However, beyond that, there is little that can usefully be said. Ms Collins submitted that the balancing exercise should take into account the possibility that a confidentiality regime could be fashioned which would limit access to the Applicants' advisors. In her submission, it was significant that Mr McGuinness did not say in his affidavit that such a regime could not work. 12 Mr Halley submitted that disclosure to the legal representatives should not occur due to the risk of inadvertent disclosure. Further, he submitted that a legal representative holding such information might be compromised even if only subconsciously. I do not read too much into the fact that Mr McGuiness did not deal with the possible alternative of a confidentiality regime, particularly where it was agreed that he should not be cross-examined. I do think that there may be risks of unintended subconscious disclosure. However, the extent of the risk is difficult to discern without viewing the documents. Ms Collins then submitted that to the extent that informers were involved, their names and any other identifying aspects of the materials could be redacted."
Case759,considered,Zarro v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40,"Ms Collins, who appeared for the Applicants, submitted first that the Court should examine the documents in MFI 1 for itself to determine the claim. On the other hand, Mr Halley SC, who appeared with Ms Allars for ASIC, submitted that in the first instance the Court should determine the matter on the affidavit of Mr McGuinness and only if it proves not possible to determine the claim should the Court look at the material. In the event that the claim was not obvious from that process, the Court should permit further evidence to be put on. Mr Halley drew particular attention to that which had fallen from Gummow J in the decision of the Full Federal Court in Zarro v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40 at 61: Where a claim has not been propounded in proper form, the court has various avenues open to it before taking its final decision in the matter. It may order that unless within a specified time a further affidavit be sworn within a specified time which shows the claim to privilege with greater particularity, the documents in question should be produced for inspection ... The court may call for a further affidavit from the same deponent to clarify some point or amplify the claim; or it may require the tender of an affidavit sworn by a more senior officer or the relevant Minister. 8 Mr Halley says that the documents contained in MFI 1 are pertinent to an ongoing investigation and that, generally speaking, they would be covered by public interest immunity. In my opinion, Mr Halley's submissions on this are to be preferred. Generally, if a claim for public interest immunity can be substantiated without the Court seeing the material, that is the preferable course. This is particularly so in relation to certain classes of documents such as cabinet documents. In view of the exigencies of the present situation, if that affidavit does not suffice, however, I will inspect the documents myself, notwithstanding what was said by Gummow J in Zarro . If that does not suffice, then I will permit a further affidavit to be filed. 15 By itself, I do not think that this explanation is sufficient for me to form a view that the documents are the proper subject of a claim for public interest immunity. More is that so where it does not appear from Mr McGuinness' affidavit that he has, in fact, examined the documents himself. I propose, therefore, to examine this document in due course. I am fortified in that approach by what was said by Lockhart J in Zarro v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40 at 50-51: In these days with large government instrumentalities and agencies involved in time consuming and extensive investigations into possible irregularities and offences, great care is required by the bodies themselves in ensuring both that the correct person within the structure of the organisation (that is, a person who knows the facts, has seen the documents and who is preferably at a high level within the organisation) swears the appropriate affidavit claiming public interest immunity and that the claim is not made too widely so as to sweep within its net documents that are not legitimately an essential integer in the investigative process. This also calls for vigilance by the courts lest documents are shielded from public scrutiny or inspection by parties to litigation under an unduly broad umbrella of public interest immunity. 16 Document 2 is an email from Ms Hayden to Ms Dodds of 4 September 2008, attaching a spreadsheet. Ms Dodds is a solicitor within the Commission. Mr McGuinness says that the email contains the work of an ASIC officer, which work is derived from the information in document 1. He says that it should be the subject of a public interest immunity claim on that basis. For the same reasons which obtain in the case of Document 1, I propose to examine document 2. 17 Document 3 is a file note of Ms Dodds of 8 September 2008, recording a conversation she had with members of the public. Ms Collins sought clarification during the course of the hearing that they were not the same discussions of which evidence, apparently, has already been filed in Supreme Court proceedings. ASIC gave that assurance. The information in the document was obtained voluntarily in circumstances where its donors would not have appreciated that their information would be given to the Applicants. Disclosure would imperil the future gathering of such information. Mr McGuinness also thought that if this information was known to the Applicants they may be able to tailor their evidence in response. It might also tip them off as to the line of inquiry being pursued. 20 I will not describe in any detail the content of document 1. Mr McGuinness says these documents have a tendency to reveal the course of the investigation. I am, unfortunately, unable to tell from looking at them the extent of the truth of that proposition. The same may be said of documents 2, 3 and 5. For present purposes, I have resealed MFI 1 and I direct that it not be opened by any person apart from myself or as ordered by another judge of this Court. Having regard to what was said by Gummow J in Zarro , I propose to allow ASIC to provide to the Court a confidential affidavit setting out what it is that is in documents 1, 2, 3 and 5 that makes them the subject of a proper claim for public interest immunity. That affidavit is to be given to my associate in a sealed envelope by 4 pm tomorrow. 21 The envelope is not to be opened by any person other than myself or as directed by another judge of the Court. The affidavit is not to be served on the Applicants nor filed through the registry. I will deliver a separate judgment at 9.30 am on Monday 27 October 2008. [ There was further discussion with counsel. ] 22 I amend the deadline in respect of the affidavit to be 4 pm on Monday 27 October 2008. I will deliver judgment at 9.30 am on Tuesday 28 October 2008.

The effect of that order, in conjunction with para 3, would be to cast upon the respondent personal liability for the costs of this proceeding by preventing him from reimbursing himself from the bankrupt estate. In my view, it is appropriate that the respondent assume personal liability for the costs of the application. Counsel for the applicants referred me to the judgment of Wilcox J in Oayda v Mercantile Mutual Life Insurance Co Ltd (unreported, Wilcox J, 20 February 1995) in which his Honour made an order the effect of which was to require a trustee in bankruptcy to pay costs personally, when the trustee in bankruptcy had acted wrongly in relation to a proof of debt. On considering the question, I think that s 179(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act provides me with sufficient authority to make an order ensuring that the respondent will bear the costs personally. For these reasons, I make the following orders by consent, that: Pursuant to s 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), the respondent is removed as trustee in bankruptcy of the bankrupt estate of Ramadan Alievski. Pursuant to s 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), Gess Rambaldi of Level 19, 15 William Street, Melbourne, Victoria, be appointed as trustee in bankruptcy of the bankrupt estate of Ramadan Alievski in place of the respondent.

Case766,cited,Harrington-Smith on behalf of The Wongatha People v State of Western Australia [2002 FCA 184,"WAFIC has been named as a respondent in some other native title determination applications in Western Australia, the District Registrar who received its notice of intention to become a party to the Amangu application referred the matter to a judge because of a decision of Lindgren J refusing an application by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia to be joined as a party in the Wongatha proceedings Harrington-Smith on behalf of The Wongatha People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 184. In the notice of intention to become a party lodged by WAFIC on 28 July 2005, it gave details of its interest thus: Application may have an adverse effect on the rights and interests of the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council (Inc) as set out in Attachment A.' Attachment A to the notice identified WAFIC as the peak industry body for the fishing industry in Western Australia. It referred to its role of liaising with government on behalf of its members in connection with the management of various fisheries. Some of those fisheries are located in the claim area. WAFIC's role and function as liaison with government in relation to policies and issues concerning the fishing and pearling industries was said to depend on: the managed fisheries in a particular area; the number of its members operating in that area; and the ability of its members to access the fisheries in that area.' It was submitted that the function of various committees and WAFIC's role on those committees constituted an interest capable of being affected by the native title claim. If the claim were made out WAFIC's role in advising government in relation to issues raised by the committees would be affected as the rights of its members would be affected by the declaration of co-existing rights or by the declaration that no rights exist. It described its role in those committees as 'political' in that it plays a part in the political process of lobbying or at least making recommendations to government. In Harrington-Smith , Lindgren J referred to the Byron Environment Centre case and the Woodridge decision and said (at 2): do not find it necessary to refer to the discussion of the matter in those cases, beyond noting that they establish that a society, organisation, association or other body which voices, protects or promotes the concerns and interests of its members does not, by reason of that circumstance alone, have ""interests [which] may be affected by a determination in the proceedings"" for the purposes of subs 84(5) of the Act.' Applying that proposition to the position of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, his Honour refused its application for joinder. See also Adnyamatha People v South Australia [2003] FCA 1377 ; (2003) 133 FCR 242 (Mansfield J)."
Case767,cited,Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1,"leading case on the range of 'interests' which confer standing under the Act is Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1. That case concerned the party provisions of the Act in effect before the 1998 amendments. They were ss 68 and 69 . The decision, however, remains authoritative for the similarly worded party provisions in s 84. In that decision the Full Court held that the interests which could be affected by a determination in relation to an application for native title and thus give rise to an entitlement to party status are not confined to the interests in land or waters which are referred to in s 253 of the Act. Black CJ held that the interest sufficient to give a person the right to become a party to an application should be greater than that of a member of the general public. They must be genuine and the possible effect must be genuine. The Parliament could not have contemplated that the rights given to persons as parties would have other than a genuine foundation. His Honour said (at 7): nature and content of the right to become a party to proceedings for the determination of native title, with the power as a party in effect to veto the process of mediation and conciliation which the Act favours, suggests that the interests with which s 68(2)(a) and the related sections dealing with parties are concerned are interests that are not indirect, remote or lacking substance. The nature and content of the right also suggests that the interests must be capable of clear definition and, equally importantly, that they are of such a character that they may be affected in a demonstrable way by a determination in relation to the application.' The requisite interest did not need to be proprietary, legal or equitable. He said (at 7): the interests must be genuine and not indirect, remote or lacking substance, there is no indication that, for example, a person who has a special, well-established non-proprietary connection with land or waters which is of significance to that person is not be regarded as having interests that may be affected by a determination. To the contrary, the consensual objects of the Act would seem to be advanced if a person with genuine interests of that nature that might or would be affected did have the rights of involvement in the process of native title determination given by the Act to a person who is a party. Each case will of course turn on its own facts and whether or not interests will or may be affected will depend upon an assessment of the interaction between the interests asserted by a person who wants to be a party and the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests claimed.' The concept of interest did not extend to interests of 'an emotional conscientious, ideological or intellectual kind only'. Relevantly his Honour also said (at 9): formation of an association or the incorporation of a body with particular objects will not, of itself, create interests that may be affected for the purposes of provisions in the Act relating to parties. ... a body that represents the interests of others whose members have interests that may be affected, does not, for that reason alone, become a person whose interests are affected; such interests as it thereby has are wholly indirect. is not to deny that a corporation may have interests that may be affected by a determination of native title if, for example, its activities might be curtailed or otherwise significantly affected by the determination.' In Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2001] FCA 419 ; (2001) 108 FCR 527, Katz J considered the proposed joinder of the New South Wales Farmers' Association pursuant to a notification under s 84(3)(b) of the Act. His Honour denied the Association party status on the basis that it had failed to establish its possession of interests which might be affected by a native title determination in either sense of: (a) proprietary or contractual interests in the land the subject of the application; or (b) conducting activities which may be adversely affected by such a determination. His Honour held, following the judgments in Byron Environment Centre that a body that represents the interests of others whose members have interests that may be affected does not, for that reason alone, become a person whose interests are affected. Katz J distinguished the Gunai decision and its acceptance by Lockhart J on the basis that the Lake Tyers Beach Sports and Angling Club was not a legal person, separate from its individual members. His Honour said that to recognise 'the Club' as a party was simply an informal method of recognising its individual members as parties. He observed that Lockhart J appeared to be conscious of the Club's unincorporated status. In Harrington-Smith , Lindgren J referred to the Byron Environment Centre case and the Woodridge decision and said (at 2): do not find it necessary to refer to the discussion of the matter in those cases, beyond noting that they establish that a society, organisation, association or other body which voices, protects or promotes the concerns and interests of its members does not, by reason of that circumstance alone, have ""interests [which] may be affected by a determination in the proceedings"" for the purposes of subs 84(5) of the Act.' Applying that proposition to the position of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, his Honour refused its application for joinder. See also Adnyamatha People v South Australia [2003] FCA 1377 ; (2003) 133 FCR 242 (Mansfield J). It is clear from the authority of the Full Court decision in Byron Environment Centre that WAFIC cannot acquire party status by reason of the possible effects of a native title determination on the interests of its members. It asserts, however, that it has an affected interest by reason of its participation in statutory committees advising government in relation to managed fisheries, some of which exist in the claim area. It does not appear to me however that this function, carried out on the part of WAFIC, can be compared to that of a statutory authority with direct responsibility for the management of an area the subject of a native title determination application. WAFIC's involvement as described in its submissions and supporting evidence, seems to relate to advice to government on policy for the management of the relevant fisheries. No evidence is shown which logically link the economic interests of WAFIC as an organisation to a native title determination in the claim area. Nor am I satisfied that the evidence discloses any real basis upon which WAFIC's capacity to participate in the committees to which it has referred would be affected. In so saying, I accept that WAFIC has been joined as party in some applications without any contention and has acted as agent in others. It has played a valuable role in the submissions that it has made in such cases, not least in the Bardi Jawi case which I heard as trial judge, albeit WAFIC had been joined by order of Lee J. In my opinion however, I am bound by the authority in Byron Environment Centre to reject WAFIC's application for joinder as a party. It may of course act as agent on behalf of a party in relation to the proceeding. That does not require the intervention of the Court. Under s 84B a party to a proceeding can appoint an organisation as its agent. WAFIC's application for joinder is therefore refused. The same considerations arise in relation to the Ngarla Peoples' claim and again, WAFIC's application for joinder in that claim will be refused. I note that among the proposals for amendments to the Act arising out of the recent Commonwealth Government review is a proposal under which industry bodies could be joined as parties. In my opinion, provided that their participation is confined to the representation of their member interest holders in matters directly relevant to the impact of a native title determination on those interests, then the capacity to effect such a joinder may be a useful facility."
Case768,cited,"Re An Application for Native Title Determination by the Gunai People (unreported, National Native Title Tribunal, 17 January 1997, French P)","J, like Black CJ, rejected a construction of the party provisions of the Act which would limit their application to persons with legal or proprietary interests. His Honour said (16): who may not have a right or interest in the land in a proprietary sense, but nevertheless have an interest in a broader sense, will be entitled to have a say in the matter and be able to negotiate some arrangement to accommodate their interests if they are parties to the application, which is the question arising in this case.' His Honour referred, without disapproval, to my decision, as President of the National Native Title Tribunal, in relation to the Gunai Peoples' native title determination application in 1997 allowing joinder of the Lake Tyers Beach Sport and Angling Club which comprised: 65 members who use the waters and surrounding areas of Lake Tyers daily for recreational fishing.' An Application for Native Title Determination by the Gunai People (unreported, National Native Title Tribunal, 17 January 1997, French P) Lockhart J said that the standing provision was not to be encased in technical rules. The class of interests for which it provides is wider than that defined by s 253 and it would be impossible and unwise to attempt to define the class in any definitive sense. It would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case (at 19): interest must be above that of an ordinary member of the public, and must be not that of a mere intermeddler or busybody. The person must have some interest that may be affected by the native title determination. The persons who sought the status of parties before French J in the Gunai application provide a good example of persons with a relevant interest for the purposes of s 68(2)(a). If it be said that this is too broad an analysis and that the floodgates will open, then I must say that over the past 18 years on the Bench of this Court I have never seen the floodgates open in any matter, despite dire predictions to the contrary.' In Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2001] FCA 419 ; (2001) 108 FCR 527, Katz J considered the proposed joinder of the New South Wales Farmers' Association pursuant to a notification under s 84(3)(b) of the Act. His Honour denied the Association party status on the basis that it had failed to establish its possession of interests which might be affected by a native title determination in either sense of: (a) proprietary or contractual interests in the land the subject of the application; or (b) conducting activities which may be adversely affected by such a determination. His Honour held, following the judgments in Byron Environment Centre that a body that represents the interests of others whose members have interests that may be affected does not, for that reason alone, become a person whose interests are affected. Katz J distinguished the Gunai decision and its acceptance by Lockhart J on the basis that the Lake Tyers Beach Sports and Angling Club was not a legal person, separate from its individual members.

Case769,cited,Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria (1996) 1 AILR 482,"J referred to the joinder by Olney J of the Victorian Field and Game Association as a party in the Yorta Yorta application Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria (1996) 1 AILR 482. His Honour also referred to the joinder of the persons and organisations referred to in the Gunai Peoples' case. He observed that the 10 groups of persons and organisations admitted as parties in that case included frequent recreational users of the land and waters covered by the claim, commercial entities said to be dependent for their livelihood upon continuing recreational use of the claimed area by local persons and visitors, property owners entitled to free access to parts of the area claimed and sporting and angling clubs or associations which are the conducted sporting, shooting or angling activities in parts of the claimed areas or had members who frequently or habitually engaged in such activities. In relation to the standing of organisations representing persons whose interests might be affected, Merkel J said (at 43): an individual lacks the requisite interest the position cannot be improved or altered by an application to be a party being made by an organisation representing many such individuals.' His Honour went on, however, to say that (at 43): problem arising in respect of an organisation representing members who have interests that may be affected by a determination is that the interests of the organisation are indirect. Put another way, it is the interests of members, rather than those of an organisation representing them, that may be affected.' His Honour further observed (at 43): different situation might arise if such organisations themselves conduct activities in the area covered by the claim which may be curtailed, interfered with or otherwise affected by a determination. In such cases there is no reason in principle why such organisations may not be persons whose interests may be affected by a determination.'"

See also Adnyamatha People v South Australia [2003] FCA 1377 ; (2003) 133 FCR 242 (Mansfield J). In the present case WAFIC does not take issue with what Lindgren J drew from Byron Environmental Centre and Woodridge . Rather, WAFIC contended that its factual position differed from that of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy in a material way. It relied in particular upon WAFIC's representation on, and participation in, advisory committees established under the FRMA. This participation, it was said, included representing the interests of its members by presenting and promoting its members' views with respect to fishery management and protection policy and acting as an intermediary between government and industry. It referred to the formulation of cohesive industry policy. It was contended that WAFIC's participation in these committees is essentially in its own right and on behalf of 'industry' and not merely on behalf of any particular member of WAFIC. An impact on fisheries in the claim area would or could have an effect on management of fisheries outside or partly outside the claim area. WAFIC submitted that the cases which suggest that an industry body does not have an entitlement to participate in the native title claim in its own right have not dealt with an industry body with statutory functions in resource management under existing statutes. It also referred to Nicholson J's decision to allow WAFIC's application to be joined in Ngaluma Ingibandi and it was submitted that unless the view was formed that Nicholson J was clearly in error in allowing WAFIC's notice, then WAFIC ought to be joined as a party to the claim. However, the basis upon which his Honour made the joinder order is not evident as there were no reasons published for the decision. In the alternative, WAFIC submitted that it should be '... joined as a party as agent for specified parties under s 84B of the Native Title Act '. This submission misconceives the operation of s 84B which provides: A party to a proceeding may appoint a society, organisation, association or other body to act as agent on behalf of the party in relation to the proceeding. The same body may act as agent for 2 or more parties in the same proceeding.' The status of 'agent' under s 84B of the Act is qualitatively different from that of party."

Case772,discussed,Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473,"line between a claim apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal and a claim which depends for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal may not always be easy to detect. However, I think it is clear on which side of the line this case falls because the case now put is quite a different one to the case put to the Tribunal. In my respectful opinion, the words of Gleeson CJ in Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at 479 [1] are apposite: ""Proceedings before the Tribunal are not adversarial; and issues are not defined by pleadings, or any analogous process. Even so, this Court has insisted that, on judicial review, a decision of the Tribunal must be considered in the light of the basis upon which the application was made, not upon an entirely different basis which may occur to an applicant, or an applicant's lawyers, at some later stage in the process."" In applying the relevant principles to the facts, it is worth repeating the facts as to how the appellant has formulated his claims at various stages. In this application for a protection visa, the appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution because he was a male member of his family and he was at risk of being killed by members of an opposing family. A blood feud had arisen as a result of disputes over land ownership. Before the Tribunal, the appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution because: (1) he is a member of a particular social group (""male Albanian child"") and will suffer persecution because of that membership; or (2) he is a member of a particular social group (""Kulak (landowner) family"") and he will suffer persecution because of that membership; or (3) he has an imputed political opinion by reason of his membership of the group referred to in (2) and he will suffer persecution because of that political opinion. Before the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant maintained the claims he had made before the Tribunal. In essence, the appellant's submission was that the Tribunal erred in not making findings as to whether there were particular social groups properly described as ""male Albanian child"" and ""Kulak (landowner) family"". That submission was rejected. On appeal to this Court, the appellant reformulated his claim. As I understood his submission, he accepts that he is now putting his claim on the ground that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of membership of a particular social group consisting of his family, and that s 91S of the Act must be considered. The appellant also accepts that his well-founded fear of persecution arises because of events surrounding the conduct of Uncle Ded on 25 April 1997. The appellant's argument is put in this way. The relevant family member for the purposes of a consideration of the effect of s 91S is Uncle Ded. However, he has a Convention reason for his fear of persecution because he fears persecution for reasons of his membership of a particular social group, being ""Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property"". The submission is that there was no reason to disregard Uncle Ded's fear of persecution, and no reason to disregard the appellant's fear of persecution. It followed that the appellant's fear of persecution arose because of his membership of a particular social group, being his family. The Tribunal failed to consider this claim and thereby fell into jurisdictional error. There are a number of reasons why the appellant's argument must be rejected. First, the appellant, with legal assistance and the advantage of the Tribunal's decision in relation to his parents' claims, formulated social groups for the purpose of the Tribunal hearing that were quite different from those formulated in this appeal. Namely, they did not relate to his family and the actions of one particular member of the family. The social groups formulated by the appellant avoided altogether (in terms of the formulation of the social group) an examination of the appellant's family and the actions of one particular member of the family. This point is not decisive, but it is a relevant consideration."
Case773,cited,Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2003) 217 CLR 387,"the particular social group now formulated by the appellant seems to me to be somewhat artificial and it must be questionable whether it comprises a cognisable group in the community (see Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2003) 217 CLR 387). It is artificial because it is very general and because it seems to me it could be formulated in a number of other ways. Clearly, it is not my role to decide these issues, but the fact that they arise is clearly relevant to whether the claim was apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. They suggest it was not."
Case774,referred to,AZAAC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1506,"is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: AZAAC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1506. On 11 November 2008, that Court dismissed an application for constitutional writs directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal""). The appellant is a male child who was born on 3 June 2004. He was born in Australia and, by reason of the fact that his parents are Albanian nationals, his nationality is Albanian. Throughout the administrative and legal processes which followed his application for a Protection (Class XA) visa (""protection visa""), his father has acted on his behalf. The appellant lodged an application for a protection visa on 28 June 2007. On 23 July 2007, his application was refused by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. He applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision. In a decision handed down on 3 December 2007, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. On the application made by the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court for constitutional writs, a federal magistrate held that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error, and dismissed the application. The application by the appellant's parents for protection visas"
Case775,discussed,Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389,"the federal magistrate, the appellant contended that the Tribunal member had made two errors. First, she had not determined at the outset whether the particular social groups advanced by the appellant were particular social groups for the purposes of the Convention and therefore she had not followed the steps laid down in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389. This error was not said by the appellant to be fatal of itself, but when combined with other errors it was significant. As I understand the federal magistrate's reasons, he accepted that the Tribunal had not made findings about these matters, but he held that this had not led to jurisdictional error. Secondly, it was submitted that the Tribunal member had erred in not undertaking an examination of whether there was a causative link between the fear and the motive for persecution. The Tribunal had failed to consider the evidence relevant to the objective ascertainment of the motives of those who were responsible for the persecution. In rejecting the appellant's argument, the federal magistrate said: ""The Tribunal expressly considered the claim that the applicant fears harm as a result of being a child in Albania. It evaluated the evidence presented by the parents on behalf of that claim and examined the country information as well and came to a conclusion that the risks presented to the child stemmed from the blood feud. I can readily conceive of cases where dealing with the subjective element and then the nexus between that and the convention related harm simply upon the basis of an attribution to the child of parental fears would give rise to a jurisdictional error. They would be circumstances where, for example, there was material before the Tribunal providing an objective basis for the fear which is attributed to the child being held for a convention related reason. The only material available to the Tribunal here was either country information that did not relate to convention-related persecution or material that indicated that the perceived harm arose from the existence of the blood feud and its consequences."" The grounds of appeal to this Court The original notice of appeal contained five grounds of appeal. Shortly prior to the hearing, the appellant forwarded to the Court an amended notice of appeal which raised three further grounds of appeal. The three further grounds of appeal were that the federal magistrate erred in not holding that the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error by reason of: ""(e) finding that the 'other member' of the family of the Appellant for the purposes of s 91S(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Uncle Ded) did not suffer fear or persecution for a Convention reason (see Tribunal decision page 19.4 AB 189.4). Particulars The Uncle was a member of the particular social group of Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property. He feared persecution for reason of membership of that particular social group, and further feared that he would receive no protection from the Albanian State, and consequently he had a Convention reason for his fear of persecution. (f) not determining that State prosecution was not available for those in danger of reprisals, when evidence had been led to that effect. (g) not determining that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution, at least hypothetically, for a Convention reason."" In essence, the appellant claims that the Tribunal member committed a jurisdictional error by failing to consider whether Uncle Ded had a Convention reason for his fear of persecution, namely, his membership of a particular social group, being ""Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property"". The Tribunal member had said that Uncle Ded's fear of persecution arose from the shooting incident and was not Convention related. Of course, there are a number of other issues in addition to the question of whether a particular social group exists for the purposes of the Convention. In Dranichnikov , Gummow and Callinan JJ said (at 394 [26]): ""At the outset it should be pointed out that the task of the tribunal involves a number of steps. First the tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention. That determination in part at least involves a question of law. If that question is answered affirmatively, the next question, one of fact, is whether the applicant is a member of that class. There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear, whether the fear is well-founded, and if it is, whether it is for a Convention reason."" There is also the issue of State protection. In this case, I do not need to consider the other issues and the issue of State protection because I have reached the conclusion that the Tribunal did not err in not identifying and considering whether Uncle Ded belonged to a particular social group described as ""Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property"". The claim now made in relation to Uncle Ded was not expressly articulated before the Tribunal and it was not dealt with by the Tribunal. The principles concerning the Tribunal's obligation to deal with claims before it are clear, although their application may give rise to difficulties. I should say that I do not think the principles or their application differ because the claim for membership of a particular social group is made in relation to a third party (Uncle Ded) and not the appellant himself. In Dranichnikov , the Tribunal had not considered a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts, that being whether the applicant was a member of a particular social group consisting of entrepreneurs and businessmen who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals (at 394 [24] per Gummow and Callinan JJ). The Tribunal had in fact considered another question which was whether the applicant's membership of a social group being ""businessmen in Russia"" was a reason for persecution and relevantly nothing more. In taking that approach, the Tribunal had constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction (at 394 [25] per Gummow and Callinan JJ; at 406 [86] per Kirby J; at 408 [95] per Hayne J). The Tribunal's obligation to consider a claim extends beyond those claims which have been clearly articulated. The question of the extent of the Tribunal's obligation to consider a claim not clearly articulated before it was considered in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1. The Full Court of this Court (Black CJ, French and Selway JJ) said (at 18 [58] and 22 [68]): ""The review process is inquisitorial rather than adversarial. The Tribunal is required to deal with the case raised by the material or evidence before it: Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1901 ; (2000) 106 FCR 157 at [114] (Merkel J). There is authority for the proposition that the Tribunal is not to limit its determination to the ""case"" articulated by an applicant if evidence and material which it accepts raise a case not articulated: Paramananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1693 ; (1998) 94 FCR 28 at 63 (Merkel J); approved in Sellamuthu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (1999) 90 FCR 287 at 293-294 (Wilcox and Madgwick JJ). By way of example, if a claim of apprehended persecution is based upon membership of a particular social group the Tribunal may be required in its review function to consider a group definition open on the facts but not expressly advanced by the applicant: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sarrazola (No 2) [2001] FCA 263 ; (2001) 107 FCR 184 at 196 per Merkel J, Heerey and Sundberg JJ agreeing.

The use of the adverb ""squarely"" does not convey any precise standard but it indicates that a claim not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. Such a claim will not depend for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal. ... Although such a claim might have been seen as arising on the material before the Tribunal it did not represent, in any way, ""a substantial clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts"" in the sense in which that term was used in Dranichnikov .

Case779,cited,STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556,"appellant had legal assistance in relation to his application to the Tribunal for review. His legal advisers wrote to the Tribunal on 19 September 2007. In their letter, they said that the appellant accepted that, as a result of the High Court's decision in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556 , the appellant could not claim refugee status on the basis that he is a member of the particular social groups described as ""Albanian citizens who are subject to the customary law"" or ""the [X] family"" which are at risk of persecution because of a blood feud. I use the letter, X, in lieu of the name of the appellant's family. On the appellant's behalf, his legal advisers submitted that he was a refugee on the following grounds: that he is a member of the particular social group being a ""male Albanian child"" and will suffer persecution because of that membership; that he is a member of the particular social group being a ""Kulak (landowner) family"" and will suffer persecution because of that membership; or his imputed political opinion as a member of a Kulak family. The appellant's legal advisers submitted that, although Albanian law does not uphold traditional or customary law, the Albanian authorities are unwilling and unable to protect the appellant from the risk of harm which he faces if he returns to that country. The Tribunal member said that the direct cause of the blood feud was the act of Uncle Ded shooting at members of the Lleshi and Biba families and not for any other reason. The fear of harm resulted from the blood feud and the blood feud would not have arisen without the occurrence of the shooting incident. The Tribunal member said that Uncle Ded's fear of reprisals was for the shooting incident and is not Convention related. As the fear held by the appellant's family member was not Convention related, the threshold question in s 91S(a) was satisfied. The Tribunal member said: ""Therefore, in accordance with subsection 91S(b), any fear of persecution on the basis of being a member of the [X] family on the basis of the shooting incident must be disregarded under section 91S of the Act. As found by the majority in the High Court in STCB v MIMIA &amp; Anor [2006] HCA 61 at [20] in similar circumstances (and acknowledged by the representative), in these circumstances, s 91S is fatal to a claim that the applicant fears persecution for reasons of membership of a particular social group that consists of his family."" The Tribunal member said that she did not need to decide if there were particular social groups of the kind advanced by the appellant (""male Albanian child"" or ""Kulak family"") because, in light of her findings of fact, membership of those ""groups"" could not be the reason for the fear of harm. She said that the shooting incident triggered the blood feud which in turn is the reason for the fear of harm. The Tribunal member concluded that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and she was not satisfied that the appellant came within Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention. The federal magistrate's reasons Thirdly, the appellant submitted that Uncle Ded's conduct was clearly not criminal and that a purpose behind the introduction of s 91S was to remove the potential for criminal families to otherwise claim refugee status ( STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556). However, the evidence before the Tribunal was at the very least equivocal as to whether Uncle Ded's conduct constituted a criminal act. It is true that he was not charged by the police over the shooting incident, but the evidence suggests that Uncle Ded shot at members of the Lleshi and Biba families as they were leaving the property. Again, it is clearly not my task to make findings about these issues. Again, they suggest that the claim now made was not apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. I have considered all the circumstances and I do not think the claim now advanced was apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. In my opinion, the Tribunal did not fall into jurisdictional error in not considering whether there was a social group of ""Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property"" and whether Uncle Ded was a member of such a group. Conclusion The appeal must be dismissed with costs.

Case780,referred to,Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 327 ; (2004) 139 FCR 580,"The Minister is not bound to proceed by reference to the direction under s 499 of the Act, namely, Direction No 21: Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 327 ; (2004) 139 FCR 580 at 585 [31] . However, he may choose to do so. In this case, he said that he would proceed in accordance with the Direction. 20 The applicant submits that the third primary consideration referred to in Direction No 21, namely, the best interests of the child, is only relevant if there is a child. He points to paragraph 2.3(c) set out in [11] above and he also points to the following paragraph in Direction No 21: ""2.13 This consideration only applies if the child is or would be less than 18 years of age at the time when the decision is intended to come into effect. The best interests of any children aged 18 years or more is not a primary consideration but may be considered with other considerations under paragraph 2.17."" 21 It should be noted that Direction No 21 makes it clear that although generally speaking it is in the child's best interests to remain with his or her parent, there may be circumstances in which the best interests are served by separation from the non-citizen."
Case781,referred to,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24,"It was accepted by the applicant that Direction No 21 is ""not so broadly stated as to cover all considerations properly brought to bear on the exercise of the discretion"". I think that approach is correct. In other words, where the decision under s 501(2) is made by the Minister, as opposed to his delegate, jurisdictional error is not established simply by showing a misconstruction of Direction No 21; it must be shown that the Minister acted outside the terms of the statutory power. Section 501(2) does not state the matters the Minister must or may take into account in exercising the discretion. In exercising an apparently unconfined discretion the determination of the limits of the statutory power is made having regard to the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the power and the Act in which it appears. In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24, Mason J said at 40: ""In the context of judicial review on the ground of taking into account irrelevant considerations, this Court has held that, where a statute confers a discretion which in its terms is unconfined, the factors that may be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion are similarly unconfined, except in so far as there may be found in the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision-maker may legitimately have regard: see Reg v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte 2HD Pty Ltd , adopting the earlier formulations of Dixon J in Swan Hill Corporation v Bradbury , and Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning . By analogy, where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute, the court will not find that the decision-maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the Act."" (Footnotes omitted.) 27 As I understood it, the applicant also conceded that if all the Minister did was to take into account as a matter in favour of cancelling the applicant's visa the fact that the applicant had no children then although the Minister had misconstrued Direction No 21 that would not constitute a jurisdictional error. I think that concession was correctly made because there is nothing in the nature and purpose of the statutory provisions to indicate that the fact that the applicant had no children is a matter the Minister was prohibited from taking into account. 28 The applicant submits that the Minister in fact made a more serious error than simply taking into account that the applicant had no children and that the error he made was a jurisdictional error. I do not find it easy to articulate the more serious error identified by the applicant but, as I understand it, it was that the Minister had found that the best interests of the children favoured cancellation of the visa when in fact that there were no children. I reject that submission. A fair reading of the Minister's reasons is that he found that the fact that the applicant had no children was a matter in favour of cancelling his visa. That was a misconstruction of Direction No 21 but not a jurisdictional error."
Case782,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gray (1994) 50 FCR 189,"The next question is whether the error of the Minister being a misconstruction of Direction No 21 amounts to jurisdictional error. The applicant referred to the following observations of French and Drummond JJ in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gray (1994) 50 FCR 189 at 208: ""If a decision-maker, not bound to apply policy, purports to apply it as a proper basis for disposing of the case in hand but misconstrues or misunderstands it so that what is applied is not the policy but something else, then there may be reviewable error. In a limiting case a policy may be so broadly stated as to cover all considerations properly brought to bear on the exercise of the discretion. In such a case misconstruction of the policy may reduce to misconstruction of the statute or misunderstanding of its purpose."""
Case783,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"In the same way as the reasons of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal are not to be approached ""minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error"", neither are the reasons of the Minister: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. 24 Even adopting that approach, I am of the opinion that the Minister misconstrued Direction No 21. The Minister referred to ""the information relevant to this consideration"" and the only information to which that could have referred is the statement that the applicant has no children. That is the information the Minister said weighed in favour of cancelling the applicant's visa and to which he said he gave (as a consideration) considerable weight. In my opinion, that is a misconstruction of Direction No 21 because once the decision-maker finds that a non-citizen has no children, the matter or consideration became irrelevant. I do not think it is possible to construe the Minister's reasons as saying no more than that the matter of the best interests of the child was irrelevant and, as this was generally a matter in favour of not cancelling the visa, the other matters in favour of cancellation were not counter-balanced by this consideration."
Case784,referred to,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Re; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1","The rules of procedural fairness apply to the exercise of the power in s 501(2) of the Act: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 ("" Lam ""). 31 The applicant submits that the matter the Minister took into account the fact that the applicant did not have children was a matter in favour of cancelling his visa stood outside the terms of Direction No 21. The applicant submits that he was not given the opportunity to comment upon whether that was a matter the Minister should take into account. The applicant submits that there had been a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and he put two alternative submissions. 32 First, he submits that he was led to believe that the Minister would make his decision by reference to the matters in Direction No 21 and only by reference to those matters. That submission requires an examination of the two letters sent to the applicant inviting him to make submissions in support of his contention that his visa should not be cancelled. In the letter from the Department dated 7 August 2006 the following passage appears: "" Should your visa be cancelled? If the Minister or a delegate makes a determination that he or she reasonably suspects that you do not pass the character test, and you fail to satisfy him or her that you do pass the character test, the Minister or the delegate will then consider whether your visa should be cancelled. Considerations to be taken into account if decision is made by a delegate In considering whether to exercise the power under s 501(2) to cancel your visa, a delegate will be required to follow directions given by the Minister under s 499 of the Migration Act . Those directions are contained in Direction No 21 ('Direction under Section 499 Visa Refusal and Cancellation under Section 501 Migration Act 1958 '). I have attached a copy of Direction No 21 for your information. Considerations to be taken into account if decision is made by the Minister If the decision in relation to cancellation of your visa is made by the Minister, although she may decide to have regard to the matters discussed in Minister's Direction No 21, she is not required to give consideration to those matters. Your opportunity to comment Before the Minister or delegate considers whether to cancel your visa under s 501(2) , you are provided with an opportunity to comment. You may provide information and comments in relation to: &#61863; whether you fail the character test; and &#61863; whether your visa should be cancelled. In making a decision whether to cancel your visa under s 501(2) , the Minister or delegate will take the following information into account already available to the Department: &#61863; Offender History Report (Attachment A) &#61863; Certificate of Record for the sentence of 02/07/2003 (Attachment B) &#61863; Judge's sentencing remarks of 02/07/2003 (Attachment C) &#61863; Report by Community Corrections Officer dated 21/06/2006 (Attachment D) The Department has also obtained reports from the Parole Board of SA. These reports have been classified as 'non-disclosable information' pursuant to Section 5(1) of the Act and can not [sic] be released to you, however you are invited to comment. If there is any additional information that you wish the Minister or delegate to consider, you must give that information to the Department. If you do not provide any further information the Minister or a delegate may rely upon the information set out above to determine that your visa are [sic] are liable to cancellation under s 501(2) of the Migration Act . In preparing your comments, please read fully and carefully the contents of the Minister's Direction. You should address each and every topic that you feel applies to you or is relevant to your circumstances. You may also provide any further information, apart from those considerations found in the Minister's Direction, that you feel the Minister or delegate ought to be aware of and take into account."" 36 In my opinion, there are two answers to that submission. First, I am not satisfied that it can be inferred that the correspondence from the Department would have led to the belief (based on reasonable grounds) that the topic of children and the best interests of children would only be dealt with in the manner contemplated by Direction No 21 and not otherwise. In this case it is a matter of looking at what may be reasonably inferred from the letters sent by the Department and other circumstances. It was not contended that the applicant's actual belief is relevant; in any event there was no evidence of his belief. It seems to me that the significance to the decision of having a family including children in Australia or not having a family for a person facing the cancellation of their visa would be obvious. Furthermore, I note that although it appears under the heading of ""Other considerations"" in Direction No 21, the Direction identifies ""family composition of the non-citizen's family, both in Australia and overseas"" as a relevant consideration: cl 2.17(d). Secondly, I do not think it can be said that any practical injustice has been shown: Lam at 14 [38] per Gleeson CJ, at 34-35 [106] per McHugh and Gummow JJ. I realise that the Court must be careful not to engage in a determination of the merits of a decision under the guise of considering an argument as to futility. However, in this case I do not think there was any practical injustice to the applicant. In practical terms he was afforded a full opportunity to be heard on the matters ultimately taken into account by the Minister. 37 In my opinion, the application must be dismissed. I will hear the parties on costs. I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.

Case785,cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Limited (1989) 20 FCR 403,"In any event, the recipient of a notice would have an obligation to claim privilege over documents in the possession of the recipient that the recipient reasonably believed were subject to the privilege of someone else, such as a client of the recipient. The recipient would have an obligation to preserve legal professional privilege by reason of the character or status of the documents as being privileged. The privilege attaches to a document and, once privileged, the document will always be privileged. As the possessor or custodian of a document that has such a special character or status, the recipient of a notice requiring production of such a document would have an obligation to take steps to preserve and maintain that character or status. The recipient of a notice would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might reasonably be expected to exist in order to ensure that such a claim for privilege would not be lost (see Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Limited (1989) 20 FCR 403 at 414). 35 A governmental authority issuing a compulsory production notice, in whatever form, must provide the recipient of the notice with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege, both on its own behalf and on behalf of others. The recipient must not be denied the opportunity to make adequate claims for privilege in relation to the documents of itself or its clients that are the subject of the compulsory production notice (see Citibank at 414). 36 However, there is no requirement for such an authority to give clients of the recipient, as distinct from the recipient, a reasonable opportunity to make claims for privilege before enforcing the compulsory production notice. The most that is required is that the recipient of such a notice must be afforded the opportunity of asserting legal professional privilege, either on the recipient's account or on account of another person, such as a client. It has not been suggested that any recipient of a notice in issue in the present proceeding was not given an opportunity to obtain legal advice or that any claim for privilege made by a recipient, on behalf of the recipient or a third party, was not respected."
Case786,cited,May v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 287 ; (1999) 92 FCR 152,"There is no requirement that a person other than a recipient be afforded the opportunity to claim or assert legal professional privilege and the scheme of the Act makes it clear that no such right is to be afforded to a person in the position of the applicants. There is no requirement for the Commission either to notify persons in the position of the applicants that a notice has been issued to a third party that may require the production of documents that are subject to a privilege of the applicants. Nor is there any requirement for a person in the position of the applicant to be notified by the Commission, after production of documents by a recipient of a notice, of the fact of the production of documents that may be the subject of a claim for privilege on behalf of an applicant that was not made by the recipient of the notice. There is no requirement, for example, that an authority issuing a compulsory production notice to a solicitor should notify the solicitor's clients that the solicitor has been given such a notice in order that the client might have the opportunity to challenge the validity of the notice on grounds of privilege (see May v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 287 ; (1999) 92 FCR 152 at [36] , [31] and [38]. 38 Further, the regime contemplated by s 29A(4) , under which a notation will be cancelled in specified circumstances, would be effective to ensure that, even if the privilege had not been claimed previously, it could be claimed as soon as a criminal proceeding is begun. Thus, the holder of the privilege would be able to make the claim for privilege prior to the tendering in evidence against that person of any document obtained by the Commission pursuant to a notice containing a relevant notation. The right of the holder of the privilege not to have privileged material used in evidence against him or her would therefore be protected. 39 Section 29B evinces a clear intention on the part of the Parliament that, in relation to documents produced by third parties who are not lawyers, the existence of the notice pursuant to which it is produced is not to be disclosed even to a potential holder or privilege, for so long as the notation is operational. The Act does not take away or abrogate legal professional privilege. It simply has the effect that, in particular circumstances, the holder of the privilege may not know that documents that might be the subject of the privilege are the subject of a notice requiring production by the possessor or custodian of the documents."
Case787,cited,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24,"An administrative decision may be impugned if the decision maker was bound to take a factor into account in reaching his or her decision but failed to do so. If a statute states expressly the factors that must be taken into account, that will be decisive. However, if the relevant factors are not expressly stated, they must be determined by necessary implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the [1986] HCA 40 ; Act ( Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40). 41 In the present case, s 29A(2) sets out factors that an Examiner must consider when determining whether a notation must or may be included in a notice. The matters that must be taken into consideration are: &#8226; the safety or reputation of a person; &#8226; the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence; &#8226; the effectiveness of an operation or investigation. 42 Further, the scheme of ss 29A and 29B recognises the existence of legal professional privilege in so far as the prohibition on disclosure does not prevent a person from making disclosure to a legal practitioner or, if the person is a legal practitioner, for the purpose of obtaining instructions as to the production of a document. 43 Under s 30(3) a legal practitioner may refuse to comply with a requirement to produce a document containing a privileged communication unless the person with whom the communication was made agrees to the practitioner complying with the requirement. The subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act make it abundantly clear that an Examiner who is deciding whether or not to issue a notice and whether to include a notation in the notice is not required to have regard to the possibility that the recipient of the notice may not discharge that recipient's obligation to assert or claim legal professional privilege that may reside in a person other than the recipient in relation to the document that the recipient is required to produce. 44 That is the clear intent and purpose of ss 29A and 29B. However, the clear object of ss 29A and 29B is to ensure that, in some circumstances, the object of an investigation, such as persons in the position of the applicants, is not informed of the existence of a notice. The relevant Examiners did not fail to take into account a consideration that they were bound to take into account simply by reason of the fact that they did not have regard to the possibility that documents that were required to be produced by a notice might be the subject of legal professional privilege of a person other than the recipient."
Case788,cited,Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong [2009] FCA 539,"22 May 2009, for reasons which I then gave, I granted certain interlocutory injunctive relief on the application of the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) - Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong [2009] FCA 539. These reasons should be read in conjunction with those of 22 May 2009. The interlocutory relief granted on 22 May 2009 was not as extensive as the ACMA had sought, but that was because of comprehensive undertakings which were then proffered to the Court. On that day, I also made directions for the further conduct of the proceedings. Those directions included the following: The first respondent provide a response to the applicant's request for particulars dated 15 May 2009 on or before 11 June 2009. The first respondent provide to the applicant a full electronic copy of that database referred to in paragraph 5 of the first respondent's discovery list filed 31 March 2009, or alternatively access to that database for the purposes of the applicant creating an electronic copy, on and from not later than 11 June 2009. The first respondent file and serve an amended discovery list by 11 June 2009, which list: (1) identifies, as fully and accurately as possible, the documents previously held by the first respondent, which it no longer holds, and what became of them; (2) identifies whether each such document is in its power or control and the steps it has taken to obtain documents that are within its power or control; (3) lists, to the extent they are within the discovery categories required of the first respondent, documents in relation to the employment of Ms Teresa Posella; (4) incorporates in the response to item 5 of the said discovery categories, production of any database in relation to the premium telephone number 19910007."
Case789,cited,Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27,"Salcedo states that he and his colleagues did not wish to appear without the services of a lawyer but could not afford that. Like any other individual party, each of the Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents is entitled to represent himself if he chooses. None of them have indicated an active interest in so doing or even that they are actively seeking alternative legal representation. The preference voiced by Mr Salcedo is not a basis for the ignoring of the progression of a case in the Court in accordance with the Court's directions. That case management considerations are relevant to the exercise of discretions in respect of matters of practice and procedure arising under the rules of court was recently emphasised by the High Court in Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 at [30]. Mr Salcedo also makes reference to negotiations having occurred with the ACMA in relation to the proceedings and attaches, without the permission of the AGS, a copy of a ""without prejudice"" letter written by the AGS in that regard. That attachment should not have occurred. The ACMA, by the AGS, does not object to the marking of the letter as an exhibit but with the proviso that the attachment should not be available for general searching. That seems to me the appropriate course to take in respect of it. I shall give directions accordingly."

In other words, there is no requirement that evidence be adduced by the parties seeking default judgment in respect of the matters pleaded in the statement of claim.

In Humphreys v Halifax Vogel Group Pty Ltd (ACN 104 808 853) (2008) IPR 144 at 146, [6] to [9], I concluded that this was the effect of the rule. I shall not repeat what is there stated."
Case791,followed,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.AU Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665,"is not to say that the receipt of evidence is precluded on an application for default judgment under O 35A. Prior authority establishes that additional evidence consistent with a party's case as pleaded in the statement of claim may be considered with respect to the relief sought: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net AU Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665 (Kiefel J (affirmed Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.AU Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 ; (2007) 161 FCR 513) (Dataline). In Dataline , Kiefel J also noted of O 35A that: The statement of claim alleges numerous contraventions of s 16(1) and s 16(9) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (Spam Act). It further alleges contraventions by the First and Second Respondents of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) with the Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents being alleged to be parties to these corporate contraventions. Albeit at the risk of over-generalisation, the conduct alleged may be summarised as the deceptive use of fabricated profiles on dating websites in order to obtain mobile telephone numbers for the purpose of sending or causing to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages to the unsuspecting telephone account holders. Yet, further conduct alleged involves the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages which purport to supply a ""single club"" or ""fantasy chat"" service to unsuspecting telephone account holders. So far as the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents are concerned, I am satisfied that the statement of claim alleges contraventions known to law of the Spam Act and the Trade Practices Act and which enliven the Court's jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief. I am further satisfied that the injunctive relief sought is not merely a bland recitation of statutory prohibitions but rather has been framed with sufficient precision to enable the Respondents concerned to identify the conduct which is the subject of restraint and so as to permit ready identification of an event of default. The declarations sought are in these terms: Declarations concerning contraventions of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) A declaration that the first respondent, whose central management and control was in Australia, by sending short message service (""SMS"") messages or causing SMS messages to be sent via 19773366 and 19910006 to Australian mobile telephone numbers, which it had obtained by deception using fabricated dating website profiles, for the purpose of dishonestly obtaining the account holders' acceptance of its Safe Divert service, has engaged in conduct in contravention of s.16(1) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) .

Case793,referred to,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Intertax Holdings Pty Ltd [2006] QSC 276,"Contrary to the submission of Counsel for Mr Pritchard, neither the express words of the Corporations Act nor the relevant extrinsic materials (see in particular paras 6.2 and 6.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum extracted at [40] above) support the contention that the provisions are "" contemplated to follow criminal prosecution rather than to precede it (with all the risks to the defendant that might entail) except where the subsequent prosecution is affected by the evidentiary restrictions imposed by s 1317Q"" . To take just one example, s 1317P is directly contrary to that submission. Moreover, the decision of Fryberg J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Intertax Holdings Pty Ltd [2006] QSC 276 does not support that submission. It was not concerned with s 1317E of the Corporations Act or a civil penalty provision but the more difficult question of the power of a court to make a declaration as to whether conduct by a corporation or its officer contravened the Corporations Act when where there is a likelihood or prospect of criminal proceedings."
Case794,referred to,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell (2006) 59 ACSR 373,"The statutory duties imposed by ss 180 , 181 and 182 of the Corporations Act reflect and, to some extent, refine the obligations of the directors at general law: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell (2006) 59 ACSR 373 at [99]. Each is a duty owed by a director to the corporation. However, directors' duties provisions are not concerned with any general obligation owed by directors to conduct the affairs of the company in accordance with the law generally or the Corporations Act . Moreover, the directors' duties provisions do not necessarily make a director liable for a breach by the company of another provision in the Corporations Act . The corollary is that it cannot be said that every breach by a company of the Corporations Act necessarily gives rise to a breach of the directors' duties provisions. 23 That last proposition or principle (that not every breach by a company of the Corporations Act necessarily gives rise to a breach of the directors' duties provisions) is self evident. It is reinforced by the fact that, under s 180(1) of the Corporations Act , the circumstances of the particular company are relevant to the content of the duty of a director to exercise reasonable care and diligence. The circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the type of company, the size and nature of the company's business, the director's position and responsibilities within the company, the particular functions the director is performing, the manner in which responsibility for the business of the company is distributed and, of course, the circumstances of the case: Maxwell at [100] and the authorities referred to. 24 The need to consider the circumstances of a particular company in defining the content of the duty of a director to exercise reasonable care and diligence is demonstrated in the case of Mr Pritchard. The circumstances of Warrenmang are outlined in paras [5] to [15] above. There was an "" identity of interest between the directors and the shareholders, so that in effect the directors [were] the shareholders "": Maxwell [103]. Ordinarily that fact may make the requirement to prevent self-interested dealing much less acute: Maxwell at [103]. In the case of Warrenmang, the identity of interest between the directors and the shareholders in fact meant the requirement to prevent self-interested dealing was acute because of the following circumstances. (1) Warrenmang was registered as an unlisted public company on 1 September 2003 with Mr Pritchard holding approximately 20 million of the 20.82 issued shares; (2) although at the time of its incorporation, three directors were appointed, Mr Pritchard was at all times the person in charge of Warrenmang's day to day activities including maintenance of its financial records and was its controlling mind; (3) on 5 December 2003 and again 10 March 2004, Warrenmang sought to raise funds from the public through the sale shares in Warrenmang and in response to the IPO and the Supplementary Prospectus did in fact raise substantial funds from hundreds of subscribers; and (4) the subscription monies were received by Warrenmang and deposited into the Warrenmang Accounts to which Mr Pritchard was the sole signatory."

Case798,cited,Re One.Tel Ltd (in liq); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich (2003) 21 ACLC 672,"ASIC may apply for such a declaration: s 1317J. Section 1317E(2) prescribes what a declaration under s 1317E(1) must specify, namely: ""(a) the Court that made the declaration; (b) the civil penalty provision that was contravened; (c) the person who contravened the provision; (d) the conduct that constituted the contravention; (e) if the contravention is of a corporation / scheme civil penalty provision the corporation or registered scheme to which the conduct related."" Section 1317F provides that a declaration of contravention is conclusive evidence of the matters referred to in s 1317E(2): Re One.Tel Ltd (in liq); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich (2003) 21 ACLC 672. As a result, the court must specify the conduct that constituted the contravention with sufficient particularity to enable the declaration of contravention not only to stand on its own but to meet the statutory requirements and purpose of s 1317E. 33 Other sections provide for the making of pecuniary penalty orders (s 1317G) and provide that the Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters (s 1317L). 34 The intersection between the civil and criminal process is addressed in ss 1317M , 1317N and 1317P . The intersection is not easy. In the present case, it is further complicated by the timing of ASIC's application for declaration of contravention. Section 1317M deals with civil proceedings after criminal proceedings and provides that: ""A court must not make a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order against a person for a contravention if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention ."" (Emphasis Added) 35 Section 1317N deals with criminal proceedings during civil proceedings and provides: ""(1) Proceedings for a declaration of contravention or pecuniary penalty order against a person are stayed if: (a) criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and (b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention. (2) The proceedings for the declaration or order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the declaration or order are dismissed."" This provision is significant. It provides that proceedings for a declaration of contravention or pecuniary penalty order are stayed if criminal proceedings are on foot at the same time in relation to conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention. In this provision, no distinction is drawn between proceedings for a declaration of contravention and proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order. 36 Section 1317P then deals with criminal proceedings after civil proceedings. It provides: ""(1) Subject to subsection (2), criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether: (a) a declaration of contravention has been made against the person; or (b) a pecuniary penalty order has been made against the person; or (c) a compensation order has been made against the person; or (d) the person has been disqualified from managing a corporation under Part 2D.6 ; or (e) an order has been made against the person by ASIC under section 920A (banning orders) or by the Court under section 921A (disqualification by Court)."""

Further, the issues of which proof is required under each provision differs in that s 84C applies where an application does not comply with ss 61 , 61A or 62 whereas O 20 r 2 is only enlivened if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious, or the proceeding is an abuse of process.

In the present application the persons who compromise the Native Title Claim Group are not identified either by name or by reference or by any sufficient description. There is also a lack of evidence that the Native Title Claim Group, which is alleged to have authorised Mr Booth, had any applicable traditional decision-making process or that any particular process was followed. There is no evidence that the Native Title Claim Group agreed to and adopted some other decision-making process in relation to authorising the applicant to make the application. Nor is there any evidence that the process has been recognised or that any process has been followed. 35 These comments are equally applicable in the case before me. Other than an assertion by the applicant that the late Oodgeroo, the late Kath Walker, has authorised the applicant to make the application, and that such authorisation is through ""Traditional Custom and Lore"", there is no evidence that the applicant is authorised by the claim group, even to the extent that the claim group in this case can be identified. No details of the decisions that the claim group made are provided. There is no evidence of the process, or that any particular process was recognised or followed by the claim group (cf Booth [2003] FCA 418 at [11] ). 36 I again note the affidavit of Ms Waters which states that the Oodgeroo descendants are part of the Gonzales family group, one of 11 family groups forming the Quandamooka Claim group. QSNTS has submitted that there is no suggestion that the smaller family group, the Oodgeroo group, could establish particular rights and interests which the larger Quandamooka Claim group cannot.

If the applicant represents a family subgroup which claims to hold native title, it is not the group which holds the common or group rights or interests within s 61 of the Act ( Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] , Dieri 127 FCR at 377, Hillig [2006] FCA 1115 at [60] )."

Case811,applied,Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178,"Notwithstanding these distinctions, the Courts have tended to equate the consequences of strike-out under s 84C with those of summary dismissal under O 20 r 2. As observed by Lander J (North and Dowsett JJ agreeing) in Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178: [48] Section 84C only applies to applications which do not comply with ss 61 , 61A and 62 . However, an application under s 84C, if successful, has the very serious consequence that the native title application is struck out. Such a result is akin to a court proceeding being summarily dismissed, or at least dismissed before any hearing on the merits. No court proceeding is summarily dismissed except in a very clear case: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioner [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 per Dixon J; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129. [49] Applications for native title are brought by representatives of the native title claim group. The dismissal of an application because, for example, the applicant has not been authorised means the dismissal of the native title claim group's claim. The repercussions, therefore, are far reaching. I see no reason why an application to strike out a native title claim under s 84C should be treated any differently to any other application to dismiss a claim summarily. The power should be exercised sparingly and with caution, and only when the Court is satisfied that the moving party has made out a clear case that the applicant has not complied with the relevant section and cannot, by amending the application, comply. Section 84C assumes that a party might respond to a strike out application by amending the claim to comply with the requirements of the Act. A claim can be amended without obtaining leave. 18 The cautious approach of the Court as described in Williams [2004] FCAFC 178 was more recently reaffirmed by the Full Court in Bodney 140 FCR at 89, where Stone J (with whom Spender and Branson JJ agreed on this point) said that notwithstanding the operation of s 84C in the context of native title applications, the Court approaches strike-out applications under this section in the same way as applications under O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules (see also Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at 497, Thomas v State of South Australia [2004] FCA 951 at [2] - [3] , McKenzie v State Government of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214 at 221)."
Case812,cited,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190,"Observations concerning the meaning of effect of s 424A were made by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 , at 1195 1196, [15] [17]. In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ, one there finds the following in para 15: Section 424A does not require notice to be given of every matter the Tribunal might think relevant to the decision under review. Rather the Tribunal's obligation is limited to the written provision of ""particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review"". 9 And then in para 17: The ""reason, or a part of the reason for affirming the decision that is under review"" was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention. When viewed in that light it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellant's statutory declaration would itself be ""information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason for, affirming the decision that is under review"". Those portions of the statutory declaration did not contain in their terms a rejection, denial or undermining of the appellant's claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations. 10 Appended to the protection visa application was a statement of the male Appellant. That statement provided the basis upon which a claim for a protection visa was made. It also provided, for the reason which I have already given, the basis upon which the Appellant's wife advanced her claim. The basis of the claim for a protection visa, as there made, was not enlarged upon in the proceedings of the Tribunal. That is because, though invited to attend at a hearing and present evidence, the Appellant and his wife did not take advantage of that opportunity. The Tribunal, then, as it was entitled to do under the Migration Act 1958 , decided the case on the basis of the material which it did have, and that material, in essence, was the statement to which I have referred."

The same reasoning must apply to a non-compliance with paras 501G(1)(c)-(f). In any event, the parties accepted that if I should uphold Mr Pomare's submission that the notice did not comply with subpara 501G(1)(f)(iv), the matter should be remitted to the Tribunal to be heard and determined in accordance with law."
Case814,followed,Zhan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 327 ; (2003) 128 FCR 469,"In Zhan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 327 ; (2003) 128 FCR 469 ( Zhan ), Allsop J had to deal with an alleged failure of a written notice to comply with s 66(2) of the Act. That provision related to notification of a decision to refuse an application for a visa. In the circumstances, the notification was required to state where an application for review of the decision could be made (subpara 66(2)(d)(iv) of the Act). His Honour said (at [64]) that the purpose of such a statement was to give information as to where the applicant could ""make the application"", that is, ""initiate it"". His Honour's statement is consistent with my holding above. 28 In Zhan , the applicant was told that lodgement of documents had to be at ""a registry of the Tribunal"" and no address was given. A leaflet giving that information was not included with the letter. His Honour left open the possibility that identification of ""registries"" of the Tribunal in the telephone directory might have sufficed to supply the meaning of the expression ""a registry of the Tribunal"", but the fact was that the telephone directory did not specify that the address given in it was that of a ""registry"". Allsop J remarked (at [65]) that the address given in the telephone directory might have been the Tribunal's head office or the site of some other activity of the Tribunal. 29 The word ""registry"" assumed a special significance in Zhan because of its appearance in the letter a feature that is absent from the present case. In this respect Zhan is distinguishable. 30 Counsel for the Minister submits, correctly, that the facts of the present case are different from those in Zhan because the written notice in the present case did state ""the Tribunal at GPO Box 9955"". However, as noted earlier, the Minister correctly concedes that an application would not be received by the Tribunal and therefore would not be made to the Tribunal when it reached that address. If an applicant led evidence to support an inference that an application reached the nominated post office box, it would nonetheless be open to the Minister to defeat the application by proving that the application was not in fact received in the registry office of the Tribunal. 31 In Chan Ta Srey v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1292 , Gray J, after referring to Zhan , held (at [53]) that where any of the requirements of s 66(2) of the Act were not complied with, there was no ""notification"" with the result that time did not begin to run in respect of an application to the Migration Review Tribunal. The same reasoning must apply to a non-compliance with paras 501G(1)(c)-(f).

I do not accept this submission. In Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Wooley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278, a copyright infringement case concerning house plans, Street J said at 286: In view of the volume of expert evidence, and the differing views expressed by the expert witnesses, I should state the use that can properly be made of that evidence in reaching a decision in a suit such as this. The decision upon the issue of similarity is an original decision for the court itself. It is to be reached upon an assessment of such similarities and dissimilarities as appear to the court between the plans or buildings under consideration. The fact that one particular expert of the highest authority and of unimpeachable credit is permitted to swear to an opinion on similarity or dissimilarity does not relieve the court of the responsibility of forming its own opinion on this issue. In this sense the expert evidence in a suit such as the present fills a somewhat unusual role. It is almost as if each side calls an expert to argue out with counsel in examination-in-chief and cross-examination the similarity or dissimilarity which that particular expert sees between the plans and houses. By attending to the progress of this argumentative process between counsel and expert the court is enabled to perceive and more readily to appreciate the points of similarity and dissimilarity. In this way the tendering of expert evidence is of value in exposing the facets of the ultimate question to which the expert opinion evidence is directed. But the important point is that, in distinction from the judicial process in relation to expert evidence such as is normally encountered in litigation, a court in the present type of litigation is entitled, and, indeed, bound, to form and act on its own original opinion.

Case817,discussed,Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67,"Cadbury submitted that if Darrell Lea wished to challenge or qualify the conclusions reached by the witness on the basis of different factual assumptions the Rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 required the cross-examiner to ask the witness whether such matters resulted in any change to his opinion. 40 As well as Browne v Dunn itself, Cadbury cited in support of this proposition the decision of the Full Court in Bush v The Queen [1993] FCA 361 ; (1993) 43 FCR 549. That case concerned an appeal from a jury's conviction of the appellant for attempted murder of his second wife and murder of her lover. Evidence was given by a Mr Saulwick of a survey of persons in the Australian Capital Territory as to their knowledge of the appellant's conviction five years earlier of the manslaughter of his first wife and the effect any such knowledge would have on their opinion as to his likely guilt of a similar offence in relation to the second wife. This evidence was adduced in support of an application for leave to challenge jurors as to cause. There was discussion at 557 by Drummond J (with whom Davies and Miles JJ agreed) critical of the usefulness of the survey. In substance his Honour found it was not useful and not a sufficient basis for its conclusion that at least one member of the jury would have connected the appellant with the 1987 killing and, for that reason, would have found the appellant guilty of the 1992 offences. Davies J at 551-552 also gave reasons for his conclusion that the survey questions were ""misconceived"". Mr Saulwick was cross-examined. It may be that some matters relied on by their Honours were not put to him. For example, in making the point that the sample was drawn from ACT voters and not the more limited population of the ACT eligible for jury service Drummond J said at 557: ""This may or may not affect Mr Saulwick's opinion"". If anything, the case seems contrary to Cadbury's argument. In any event, Browne v Dunn is not mentioned. 41 In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1 Tamberlin J discussed the application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn in the context of a copyright infringement case where one issue was whether a Mr Ron Lewy had, as he claimed, spoken by telephone to a German company and received certain assurances about copyright arrangements in Australia in respect of CDs which Mr Lewy's company was about to import. The trial judge had not accepted that the words were said. In the Full Court Tamberlin J said at 14-15: The submission made to this court is that because it was not specifically and expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy, in cross-examination, that the statement was not made, the rule of professional practice enunciated in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was breached and therefore the evidence should have been ignored or the matter reopened. The failure by his Honour to address the point was said to amount to procedural unfairness. Counsel referred to a number of decisions including Payless Superbarn (NSW) Pty Ltd v O'Gara (1990) 19 NSWLR 551 at 554 7. Ultimately, the rule in Browne v Dunn is one of procedural fairness. Whether his Honour should have taken any action in relation to the failure to put the disputed words called for the exercise of a discretionary judgment on his part. As Hunt J has pointed out, in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 26 7; (1983) 44 ALR 607 , the rule is designed to ensure fairness to the witness so as to enable the witness to deal with the disputed matter and perhaps to give further evidence in corroboration or to contradict any inference which may be sought to be drawn. See also Dolan v Australian &amp; Overseas Telecommunications Corp [1993] FCA 202 ; (1993) 42 FCR 206 at 207 8; [1993] FCA 202 ; 114 ALR 231 ; Marelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 ; (1993) 121 ALR 114 at 119 20. It is common ground that it was not expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy that the words were not said. In commercial litigation (including intellectual property matters), where issues are clearly defined, there will often be no point in formally challenging every aspect of the evidence which is contested. There will often be a large number of matters in respect of which it will be apparent from the pleadings and particulars there is clearly a contest. Where this is the case the principle need not be applied in an unduly technical way. After discussing the evidence, his Honour continued: The rule may be satisfied where the witness is on notice that the version given is disputed and such notice may come from pleadings, the opponent's evidence or opening, or from the general manner in which the case is conducted. 42 Likewise in Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 at 236 Mahoney JA said: ...failure to cross-examine a witness may not found such an assumption or render the course of the trial unfair if it is clear from the manner in which generally the case has been conducted that his evidence will be contested. This was pointed out by Lord Herschell ([in Browne v Dunn] at 71). The nature of the defendant's case and the particulars given, and otherwise the conduct of it may make it sufficiently clear that such an assumption is unwarranted and that there has been no surprise or prejudice concerning the matter. 43 As to the application of Browne v Dunn in modern commercial litigation, see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR (Digest) |P 46-183 at 50,323, approved on appeal: J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 at [103] - [107] . 51 Thus, quite apart from Darrell Lea's criticisms, the Court is entitled, and indeed bound, to form its own views on the evidence, including, but by no means limited to, the opinions of the Cadbury experts.

Case820,cited,Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 119,"After hearing further argument the Full Court made orders in relation to costs of the appeal: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 119 ( Full Court III ). The Full Court ordered that Darrell Lea pay Cadbury's costs other than its costs of and associated with grounds 1-14 inclusive, 17 and 18 of the amended notice of appeal, and that Cadbury pay Darrell Lea's costs of and associated with those grounds. 7 Their Honours in Full Court III noted at [8] that at the hearing of the appeal some grounds of the amended notice of appeal were abandoned by Cadbury, namely grounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 17 and 18, and that grounds 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which raised challenges to substantive findings of the trial judge, were pressed only formally at the hearing of the appeal and were rejected by the Court. 8 On the further hearing Cadbury called its three experts and they were cross-examined by senior counsel for Darrell Lea. Darrell Lea had filed an affidavit by an expert in the same area, a Mr Hall, but did not read his affidavit. 9 Against that background, an initial question has been raised as to the findings made in the earlier judgment under the heading Summary of Findings at [95] to [112] as follows (I have added cross-references indicating grounds in Cadbury's amended notice of appeal which challenge the finding or seek a different finding on the same topic): 95 The evidence warrants the following findings. 96 There is wide awareness amongst Australian consumers of the use by Cadbury of a dark purple colour (i) in connection with the marketing, packaging and presentation of certain chocolate products particularly Cadbury Dairy Milk and other block milk chocolate products, and (ii) as a corporate colour. [Grounds 1, 2] 97 Cadbury does not have an exclusive reputation in the use of this dark purple colour in connection with chocolate. Other traders have, with Cadbury's knowledge, for many years used a similar shade of purple. Cadbury has not consistently enforced its alleged exclusive reputation. In relation to its chief competitor Nestl&eacute;, Cadbury has, for its own commercial reasons, permitted a use of purple in relation to popular chocolate products. [Grounds 1, 2] 98 Cadbury markets many chocolate products which have little or no purple in their packaging. 99 Cadbury products, regardless of the presence or absence of purple in the packaging, always bear the Cadbury name in a distinctive script. [Ground 2] 100 Cadbury's use of purple in marketing advertising and promotion is, and is seen by consumers to be, inextricably bound up with the well known name Cadbury in its distinctive script. Cadbury never uses the colour purple in isolation as an indicium of trade. [Ground 2] 101 Cadbury products, with insignificant exceptions, are not sold at retail level at premises owned or occupied by Cadbury. [Grounds 6, 7, 8] 102 Cadbury's marketing of chocolate heavily emphasises specific products and in particular Cadbury Dairy Milk block chocolate. [Ground 8] 103 Darrell Lea is a name well known in connection with chocolate in those parts of Australia where it operates, even though not as well known as Cadbury. [Ground 10] 104 The names Darrell Lea and Cadbury are quite distinct in sound and appearance (especially with the respective scripts the parties have adopted) and not likely to be mistaken for each other. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 105 Darrell has since at least Christmas 2000 used in its marketing, packaging, promotion and point of sale presentation a purple colour much like that used by Cadbury. There has been particular use at Christmas 2000 to 2004 inclusive and also uses at other times. Such usage has diminished and purple has been to a significant extent replaced by blue since 2004. [Ground 12] 106 Darrell Lea did not adopt the colour purple with the intention of leading consumers to believe its products were Cadbury products or that it, or its products, had some kind of association with Cadbury. [Grounds 3, 4, 5] 107 Most of Darrell Lea's retailing occurs in premises which it owns or occupies. Other retailing occurs from separate stands or displays in retail premises, such as newsagents, pharmacies, convenience stores and video stores. Darrell Lea has only a minor presence in supermarkets and only, in the past, to a very limited and transient extent in the major chains. Its products are not presented for sale in close proximity to Cadbury's. [Grounds 6, 7, 8] 108 Darrell Lea's marketing gives less emphasis to particular products than does Cadbury. [Grounds 8, 10, 11, 12] 109 Darrell Lea does not sell moulded block chocolate. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 110 Darrell Lea uses its name in a distinctive script widely and consistently in marketing, packaging and point of sale presentation. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 111 Colour recognition or attraction can play an important part in consumer decisions to purchase chocolate. [Ground 9] 112 Consumer decisions to purchase chocolate are often made quickly and on impulse but not necessarily irrationally. Price and brand recognition can play an important part. [Ground 9] 10 After analysing Cadbury's case I reached the following conclusions (again, references to the grounds in the amended notice of appeal are inserted): 121 The findings above lead to these conclusions. Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market, yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names. [Grounds 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] They have distinct identities in the market place. [Grounds 11, 12] Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate. Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple, or any other colour, as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury. I am not satisfied that this has occurred, or is likely to occur."
Case821,cited,Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102,"Cadbury brought a motion to the Full Court seeking an order that the previous order remitting the matter to the trial judge for further hearing be varied to provide that the matter be remitted to the trial judge for a new trial: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102 ( Full Court II ). In rejecting Cadbury's motion the Full Court said: 4 We do not understand Cadbury to be suggesting that an order remitting the matter to the primary judge for a further hearing was not open to the Court. Cadbury's motion appears to have been prompted by a directions hearing before the primary judge on 12 June 2007 during which his Honour indicated his understanding that the effect of the Full Court's order was that there would be a further hearing at which the excluded evidence would be adduced, but that that would be the extent of the further hearing. It would seem that that was not Cadbury's understanding of the effect of the Full Court's order of 21 May 2007. 5 It is clear that Cadbury sought a new trial as part of the relief claimed in the appeal. On the hearing of the appeal, one of the issues was whether, even if there had been an error on the part of the primary judge in excluding evidence there was nevertheless no miscarriage of justice and the orders made by the primary judge should therefore stand. The Full Court rejected that contention. The Court concluded that it could not be said that the disputed evidence was of so little weight that it could not influence the result of a new trial, so as to produce a different result (at [111]). 6 However, the Court did not consider that a new trial was justified. Rather, the Court was of the view that justice would be served by a further hearing before the primary judge, at which Cadbury would have another opportunity of adducing the disputed evidence. 7 The proceeding was remitted on the basis that it would be before the primary judge as though the case were part heard. Thus, it would be a matter for the primary judge to determine the extent to which, after entertaining all proper objections and making rulings on such objections, additional or further evidence should be admitted. That may have the consequence that Darrell Lea would seek to adduce its own evidence in response to the disputed evidence. 8 We indicated in our reasons (at [110]) that, if proper objections were taken to the disputed evidence at the further hearing and the evidence was rejected, it would be open to the primary judge to allow Cadbury to elicit further evidence to overcome the objections. That would be an aspect of the management of the further hearing by the primary judge in the same way as it would have been had his Honour not rejected the disputed evidence in its entirety. That is to say, it would be for counsel for Darrell Lea to make such objections to the admissibility of the disputed evidence on formal grounds as they may consider appropriate. If, in the exercise of his discretion, the primary judge were to permit Cadbury the opportunity of adducing further evidence to overcome any objections, that would be a matter entirely for his Honour at the further hearing. 9 It is conceivable that, after hearing proper objections from Darrell Lea, none of the disputed evidence will be admitted. We do not, by that comment, indicate any view about the outcome of any objections one way or the other, except to the extent that we indicated the principles to be applied in our reasons of 21 May 2007. It is, of course, conceivable, and we make no comment one way or the other as to whether it is likely, that is Honour would still reject the disputed evidence under s 135 of the Evidence Act . That is entirely a matter for the primary judge. 10 Further, there would be no reason why the primary judge should entertain any contention that he should reverse earlier rulings made by him that were not in any way dependant upon the rejection of the disputed evidence. His Honour should be in a position to conduct the further hearing as though he had admitted such of the disputed evidence as his Honour finds to be admissible after considering appropriate objections. 11 In so far as we referred to ""a further trial"" (at [129]) or ""the new trial judge"" (at [130]) we should be understood as having referred to a further hearing by the primary judge along those lines. As we said (at [114]): In the circumstances, there is no reason why the proceeding should not be remitted to the primary judge for further hearing. Of course, if the primary judge were prepared to entertain a submission that he would not be able to bring an open mind to the resolution of the proceeding in the light of his Honour's earlier rulings both on the disputed evidence and in the final decision, it would be a matter for his Honour to decide whether he considered it was appropriate for the proceeding to be referred to another judge for a retrial ab initio. 12 Similarly, if the primary judge were persuaded that the conduct of the hearing to date was such that the admission of any part of the disputed evidence that his Honour was disposed to admit would cause injustice, it would be a matter for his Honour as to whether the trial should, for that reason, be aborted. The primary judge should be regarded as being in the same position as he would have been in had he not made the ruling of 31 March 2006. It is clear from the context that the term ""rulings"" in [10] is a reference to rulings on evidence and procedure and not substantive findings, as to which see [11]-[12] below."

Case825,cited,Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133,"Nevertheless s 80 of the Evidence Act deals only with the admissibility of evidence. It does not affect the approach to particular kinds of evidence in particular categories of cases. In Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] in the context of a s 52 and passing off case (and well after the introduction of the Evidence Act ), Branson J, after noting that both sides had called evidence of marketing consultants which was received without objection, said: However, I consider it appropriate to record that in the particular circumstances of this case, which is concerned with the packaging of a product intended to appeal to a wide segment of the general public, I have found the expert evidence of no real assistance. This is not only because there is, as is common in cases of this kind, conflict between the evidence of the two experts. It seems to me that evidence of opinions based on market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour will rarely be of assistance in litigation where the Court's primary concern is with the behaviour to be expected of, and the judgments likely to be made by, ordinary (even if it might be thought, somewhat credulous) members of the community intent on making a relatively modest purchase in a conventional way. I endorse the comment of Beaumont J in Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v IPC Media Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 104 at [92] that where a claim is essentially a matter for the Court's impression, expert views which are merely 'impressionistic' can be given no more than nominal weight.

His Lordship said (at 738; 515): [W]here goods are sold to the general public for consumption or domestic use, the question whether such buyers would be likely to be deceived or confused by the use of the trademark is a 'jury question'. By that I mean: that if the issue had now, as formerly, to be tried by a jury, who as members of the general public would themselves be potential buyers of the goods, they would be required not only to consider any evidence of other members of the public which had been adduced but also to use their own common sense and to consider whether they would themselves be likely to be deceived or confused. The question does not cease to be a 'jury question' when the issue is tried by a judge alone or on appeal by a plurality of judges. The judge's approach to the question should be the same as that of a jury. He, too, would be a potential buyer of the goods. He should, of course, be alert to the danger of allowing his own idiosyncratic knowledge or temperament to influence his decision, but the whole of his training in the practice of the law should have accustomed him to this, and this should provide the safety which in the case of a jury is provided by their number. That in issues of this kind judges are entitled to give effect to their own opinions as to the likelihood of deception or confusion and, in doing so, are not confined to the evidence of witnesses called at the trial is well established by the decisions of this House itself. 87 In its written submissions Cadbury cited numerous decisions which were said to involve facts or issues similar to the present case and statements of judges about the facts in those cases. For its part, Darrell Lea sought to draw different messages from those, and other, cases and statements.

Case830,cited,Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298,"Cadbury submitted that the failure of Darrell Lea to adduce evidence (expert or lay) as to the effect that third party use of purple has adversely impacted Cadbury's reputation in Cadbury purple meant that the Court ought to draw a Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 inference that any evidence it might have sought to adduce would not have assisted its case in this respect. I do not agree. There was substantial evidence of the fact of third party usage given by Darrell Lea's Mr Michael Lea (earlier judgment [52]-[54]) and evidence of Cadbury's ""Co-existence Agreement"" with Nestl&eacute; under which Cadbury agreed not to object to Nestl&eacute;'s use of get-ups for Violet Crumble (a chocolate-coated honeycomb bar which might be said to verge on the iconic), Wonka, Quality Street and Polly Waffle, all of which featured purple ([55]-[56]). For its part Cadbury adduced evidence of its efforts to restrain third party usage, which met with mixed success ([57]-[67]). There was evidence of actual third party usage in the present case sufficient for the Court to make its own findings. 59 Mr Riches said that the third party products ""did not come close to dominating the chocolate confectionery market in the same way as Cadbury Dairy Milk"" and that no other brand consistently used purple as a ""brand identity element"" in promotional campaigns. Dr Stavros thought that purple used with Polly Waffle and Violet Crumble were ""product specific instances of the use of a colour, rather than a corporate or master branding or mega branding"". However, the lack of specialised knowledge of the confectionery market of these witnesses has already been noted. 60 Dr Stavros said that some consumers would pick up a Violet Crumble, see the Nestl&eacute; brand and ""make the connection between those brands [ie Nestl&eacute; and Cadbury] and be aware that there's a distinction between those organisations"". He continued: There's a scope though for other consumers to see the purple, relate that to the Cadbury brand and either believe that the product comes from Cadbury, or that there is some association between those organisations, I think that's possible it's very possible. Dr Stavros' hypothesis, involving as it does a very well known non-Cadbury manufacturer and a very well known non-Cadbury product, is speculative and quite unrealistic."

The question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in s 52. Much of Dr Gibbs' opinions as to misinference and misassociation would seem to be examples of the ""caused to wonder"" reaction by consumers (and others such as employees and competitors).

Case833,cited,Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1,"In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1 Tamberlin J discussed the application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn in the context of a copyright infringement case where one issue was whether a Mr Ron Lewy had, as he claimed, spoken by telephone to a German company and received certain assurances about copyright arrangements in Australia in respect of CDs which Mr Lewy's company was about to import. The trial judge had not accepted that the words were said. In the Full Court Tamberlin J said at 14-15: The submission made to this court is that because it was not specifically and expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy, in cross-examination, that the statement was not made, the rule of professional practice enunciated in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was breached and therefore the evidence should have been ignored or the matter reopened. The failure by his Honour to address the point was said to amount to procedural unfairness. Counsel referred to a number of decisions including Payless Superbarn (NSW) Pty Ltd v O'Gara (1990) 19 NSWLR 551 at 554 7. Ultimately, the rule in Browne v Dunn is one of procedural fairness. Whether his Honour should have taken any action in relation to the failure to put the disputed words called for the exercise of a discretionary judgment on his part. As Hunt J has pointed out, in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 26 7; (1983) 44 ALR 607 , the rule is designed to ensure fairness to the witness so as to enable the witness to deal with the disputed matter and perhaps to give further evidence in corroboration or to contradict any inference which may be sought to be drawn. See also Dolan v Australian &amp; Overseas Telecommunications Corp [1993] FCA 202 ; (1993) 42 FCR 206 at 207 8; [1993] FCA 202 ; 114 ALR 231 ; Marelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 ; (1993) 121 ALR 114 at 119 20. It is common ground that it was not expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy that the words were not said. In commercial litigation (including intellectual property matters), where issues are clearly defined, there will often be no point in formally challenging every aspect of the evidence which is contested. There will often be a large number of matters in respect of which it will be apparent from the pleadings and particulars there is clearly a contest. Where this is the case the principle need not be applied in an unduly technical way. After discussing the evidence, his Honour continued: The rule may be satisfied where the witness is on notice that the version given is disputed and such notice may come from pleadings, the opponent's evidence or opening, or from the general manner in which the case is conducted."

Case840,followed,Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226,"Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 , I said that determination of the question of the ""proper"" claimant group is not properly a subject for determination on a strike out application. I said at [7] and [8]: 7 Whether the Ballaruk and Didjarruk people was a wider group of people than Mr Bodney's immediate family was a matter of serious dispute before the primary judge. William Warrell and Margaret Gentle had sworn affidavits consistent with the view that the Ballaruk and Didjarruk people was a wider group than Mr Bodney's immediate family. However, Mr Warrell and Ms Gentle were not cross-examined, even though it is plain that Mr Bodney disputed the accuracy and indeed the truthfulness of the claims that they made in their respective affidavits. 8 Resolution of that factual question is, in my respectful view, not properly the subject for determination on a strike-out application. The finding of lack of authorisation (or, more precisely, the primary judge's finding that Mr Bodney had failed to establish authorisation in either of the ways contemplated by s 251B of the Act), was dependent on the factual finding by the primary judge on that question. In my judgment, it is not appropriate at this time and on this application to determine those issues. Three of the persons who have executed affidavits for Mr Delaney, namely, Neville Isaacs Jnr, Ervyn Isaacs, and Stella Isaacs, are respondents to the principal proceedings, and therefore are entitled to be heard on those issues in the proceeding. It is a curious feature of the present application that it is contended that there are alternative bases for the authorisation to change the composition of the applicant. The primary submission is that Ms Connie Isaacs, on 9 February, made the decision, and she, as Elder was entitled to make that decision for the purposes of s 251B(a) of the Act. The traditional laws and customs of the native title claim group, it was said, gave the authority to make that decision to Ms Isaacs as Elder. That was the basis on which Ms Isaacs made the original application. In the present case, all but one of the adult members of the native title claim group (as expressed in the original application) have acquiesced and acceded to this particular exercise of authority by Ms Isaacs, after there was consultation among members of the claim group as to what was proposed. The remaining adult member, Jodie Briggs, has previously acknowledged the authority of Ms Isaacs as Elder. The curious feature is that it was submitted that if the Court was not satisfied that the decision of Ms Connie Isaacs as Elder was the process of decision making under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the Turrbal native title claim group, there had nonetheless been a decision made to authorise Ms Isaacs and Ms Barambah pursuant to a process of decision making agreed to and adopted by the persons in the native title claim group, to be inferred from the conduct of the members of the native title claim group between 9 February and 15 June 2007, when the senior members of the Turrbal group met for the purpose of making a decision. That decision was subsequently ratified by as many adult members of the Turrbal claim group as practicable (indeed, by all but one), and the resolution initially passed on 9 February 2007, having subsequently been ratified by all but one adult members of the native title claim group, constituted a sufficient authorisation within the requirements of the Act. There is simply no evidence that that method of decision making was the process of decision making required to be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group. The original application was not authorised by that process and, it seems to me, the alternative form of authorisation contended for factually is at odds with the primary contention of the applicant concerning authorisation, namely, that Ms Connie Isaacs as Elder had the authority of the native title claim group to make the original application, because that was the decision making process mandated by the traditional laws and customs of the native title claim group. If Connie Isaacs had authority on that basis to make the original application, she similarly had authority on the same basis to make the decision to change the constitution of the applicant from Ms Connie Isaacs to Ms Connie Isaacs and Maroochy Barambah. Both Helen Bowskill, counsel for the State of Queensland, and Mr Peter Flanagan SC for the Commonwealth submitted that s 66B assumes that the current applicant (who is sought to be replaced by the current applicant and her daughter) had authority to bring the claim at the time the claim was made: s 66B(1)(a)(i)."
Case841,considered,Bodney v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 890,"J then agreed with the observation of Wilcox J in Bodney v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 890 at [45] where Wilcox J said: Section 84C(2) of the new Act says that, upon an application being made under s 84C(1), the ""Court must, before any further proceedings take place in relation to the main application, consider the application under subsection (1)"". It may be, as submitted by Mr Wright on behalf of the State, that the requirement to ""consider"" the application does not include a requirement to determine the application. It may be open to the Court, having considered the merits of an application, to decide to defer a ruling on it until the trial of the principal application. Whether or not that is so, it is clearly the policy of the Act that the Court should give immediate attention to a strike out motion. The reason, no doubt, is that it is undesirable to allow parties to be put to trouble and expense in relation to an application that fails to comply with the fundamental requirements stated in ss 61, 61A and 62."
Case842,considered,Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31,"J in Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31 refers to the distinction between people who claim to hold common or group rights and interests, and those who actually hold those common or group rights and interests. Lindgren J said at [1189] [1193]: 1189 [That result] is an odd use of language. It is a natural use of language to designate the group of persons on whose behalf a claimant application is made, as 'a claim group', whether or not the application proves to be successful, and those persons, 'including the applicants', as 'claimants'. Yet the expression 'native title claim group' is defined in the NTA as being, relevantly, all the actual holders, according to their traditional laws and customs, of the particular native title claimed: NTA ss 253, 61(1). It follows that there cannot be an authorisation within s 61(1) unless there are actual holders of the particular native title claimed. 1190 Logically, the authorisation issue can be finally determined only after I determine whether there are actual holders of the particular native title claimed, and if so, who they are. Since I decide below that there are no holders of the particular native title claimed, the making of the present application could not have been authorised by all of those persons. 1191 Authorisation was addressed extensively in submissions. I will address the issue independently of my conclusion that there are no actual holders of the particular native title claimed. I will address it as if I were dealing with a strike out application under s 84C. 1192 How does s 84C, which assumes that it may be possible for an application to be struck out prior to the final determination of an application, accommodate the fact that the native title claim group is defined to mean the actual holders of the particular native title claimed? In my opinion, the answer is that the striking out remedy is available once it clearly appears that, if the application were to succeed according to its own terms, the applicants would not have been authorised by all those persons the Court would determine to be the actual holders of the particular native title claimed, that is to say, by all the members of the 'claim group' (all the 'claimants'). 1193 I will take this approach also to the challenges to authorisation of all Claims before the Court, that is to say, I will assume that the claimants identified in the Form 1 are actual holders of the particular native title claimed in that Form. The opposition by Mr Delaney to the granting of the relief sought by the notice of motion depends on establishing that the claimant group, as contended for by the applicant Connie Isaacs, is wrong, and that Connie Isaacs does not, and never had, the authorisation of the correct claimant group. The observations of Lindgren J in [1192] above indicate that a strike out application would depend on whether it was established that the applicant was not authorised by all the members of the claim group, ie, all the ""claimants"". The question of whether all the ""claimants"" constitute the persons who actually hold the common or group rights and interests confirming the particular native title claimed, or whether the persons who actually hold those rights and interests is a wider group (as Mr Delaney contends), being a factual dispute, is not properly the subject of determination on a strike out application."
Case843,followed,Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178,"J (with whom North J at [1] and Dowsett J at [10] agreed) in Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 said, at [53]: 53. Section 66B assumes that the current applicant, who is sought to be replaced, had authority to bring the claim at the time the claim was made: s 66B(1)(a)(i). The hearing of a s 66B motion is not the proper occasion to explore the broader issue as to whether or not a native title determination application was properly authorised in the first place for the purposes of s 61 and s 251B of the Act. Such an issue can be explored either in the course of a strike-out application under s 84C of the Act, or at the trial of the application. Lander J discussed the operation of s 84C and the question of proper authorisation at [54] to [59] inclusive: 54 ... in this case, where the appellant contended that the first respondent was never authorised to bring the native title application, the appellant has adopted the correct procedure, which is to proceed under s 84C. 55 Section 84C(2) requires the Court to consider the application to strike out 'before any further proceedings take place in relation to the main application'. 56 That subsection recognises that if an application under s 84C is successful the application for native title will be struck out. Because of the possible consequences of the application, it is in all parties' interests that the application be heard before any other steps are taken in relation to the main application. The subsection requires the Court to 'consider the application made under subsection (1)'. The subsection does not require the Court to determine the application before any further steps are taken. The use of the word 'consider' without an obligation on the Court to also 'determine' the application is deliberate. 57 In some cases it will be appropriate to determine the application at the same time as it is considered. Where the application to strike out is obviously without merit then it may be dismissed immediately. Where the application is clearly a case that calls for relief under the section, recognising that relief will be provided sparingly as I have described it, then an order will be made dismissing the main application. In many cases, an applicant faced with an application under s 84C will apply to amend the application to cure an identified deficiency. For example, where an application is based upon an applicant's failure to comply with s 62 in supplying the details under that section, an applicant might respond by amending the application to make it comply. In those cases, the Court will not be called upon to determine the s 84C application. 58 In some cases it may be difficult to decide whether the application should succeed. For example, it may be difficult to decide, on the papers, whether the applicant has been authorised by the native title claim group. 59 In that case it may be appropriate to hear and determine the application under s 84C at the same time as the main application. ... If Ms Isaacs had authority as Elder to make the original application, as I hold on the authority of Williams v Grant s 66B assumes she had, she therefore had authority as Elder to decide on an altered composition of the applicant. For the above reasons, I am satisfied that it is proper to grant the relief sought by the notice of motion.

Specifically, she alleged that she had been dismissed because of a temporary absence from work due to illness and because she had filed complaints against her employer alleging breaches of applicable laws. She commenced a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court in which she sought re-instatement to her former position, compensation and costs. At trial, she abandoned her claim for re-instatement and advised the Court that she sought compensation and an apology. The proceeding was dismissed by the Federal Magistrate: see Kang v Attorney-General's Department [2008] FMCA 638. 3 The respondent (who was, by order of this Court, identified as the Commonwealth of Australia) opposed the application and sought its costs. The Federal Magistrate did not rule on the costs application. 4 Ms Kang lodged an appeal in this Court. The Commonwealth cross-appealed on the costs issue.

Case849,cited,Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2007) 237 ALR 672,"Section 666 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) provides that a party must not be ordered to pay the costs of any other party in a proceeding alleging a contravention of s 659 of the Act unless the Court is satisfied that the applicant instituted the proceedings without (inter alia) reasonable cause. The respondent contended that the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court had been instituted without reasonable cause and that it had no real prospects of success or was doomed to failure: see Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2007) 237 ALR 672 at 685. This was because Ms Kang did not produce any evidence capable of supporting her application and because the case she presented to the Court amounted to a mere allegation which could be rebutted by a simple denial by the respondent. 62 Ms Kang's application to the Federal Magistrates Court, insofar as it alleged a contravention of s 659(2)(e) , was bound to fail. Her own evidence established that she had not made any complaint to any external authority. In the absence of such a complaint, for reasons already given, she could not succeed. 63 It cannot, however, in my opinion, be said that her complaint alleging a contravention of s 659(2)(a) had no prospects of success or was doomed to fail. Ms Kang gave undisputed evidence about a series of absences from work which commenced in mid February 2007. She was absent when the decision was made to terminate her employment. She had provided the Attorney-General's Department with medical certificates to explain her absences. This evidence alone was, of course, not sufficient to make good a claim of contravention of s 659(2)(a). It was, however, sufficient, having regard to the provisions of s 664(b) , to require more than a mere denial on the part of the respondent. The respondent did not, apparently, consider that a mere denial would suffice. It accepted that it was necessary to call Mr Kennedy to give evidence about when he made his decision, why he made it and his knowledge (or lack of it) of the medical certificates and Ms Kang's absences prior to his making the decision."
Case850,referred to,SZJUK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 439,"This is an appeal from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Scarlett given on 21 March 2007: SZJUK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 439. His Honour dismissed, with costs, an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") signed on 25 October 2006 and given on 14 November 2006. 2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He arrived in Australia on 20 October 2004. On 3 December 2004 he applied for a protection (class XA) visa. On 7 March 2005 a delegate of the respondent Minister refused that application. The appellant then sought review of that decision from the Tribunal. The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision on 4 August 2005. The appellant then sought judicial review. 3 On 5 June 2006 Federal Magistrate Barnes made orders by consent quashing the Tribunal's decision and remitting the application for reconsideration. The appellant was then invited to attend a second Tribunal hearing, which he did. Ultimately, the Tribunal rejected his application. In doing so, it found that his evidence was not credible, largely because the claims that he advanced before the first Tribunal differed in certain respects from his claims before the second Tribunal. 4 The appellant's claims can be briefly stated. He says that he is a member of Falun Gong, and that by reason of that fact, he faces persecution if required to return to China. 5 In his application for a protection visa the appellant said that he was born in Fujian, China, in 1972 and was married in 1996. His wife and daughter continue to reside in China. He said that he was a sales/department manager prior to coming to Australia, and had held that position from March 2003 to October 2004. He claimed that he had been unemployed from February 1996 until February 2003 and that prior to that he had been a construction worker and a farmer. He claimed that he left China legally using a passport issued in his name in Fujian in November 2002 which would expire in November 2007. He claimed that he had had difficulties, which he detailed as ""bribery"", obtaining his passport. He claimed that his passport was not valid for return to China because ""it must have been blacklisted""."
Case851,distinguished,Boakye-Danquah v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 438 (2002) 116 FCR 557,"The Tribunal then turned its attention to the question of compassionate and compelling circumstances, for the purpose of determining whether reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations was applicable. At [74], it referred to Boakye-Danquah v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 438 (2002) 116 FCR 557. In that case, the Court was dealing with an earlier version of item 820.211 in Sch 2 to the Migration Regulations , in which there was a requirement to satisfy several criteria found in Sch 3, 'unless the Minister is satisfied that there are compelling reasons for not applying those criteria.' Relying on an explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister at the time when this provision had been inserted into the Migration Regulations , which described the provision as a 'waiver provision', Wilcox J held at [33] that it was clear that the 'compelling circumstances' criterion was intended to be satisfied at the time of application for a visa, not at the time of decision, because item 820.211 in its entirety was required to be satisfied at the time of application. Discussing the effect of this case at [76] of its reasons, the Tribunal said: 'The Tribunal notes that the Court in Boakye-Danquah was not concerned about whether compassionate and compelling circumstances applied to justify a waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement. However, the Court clearly stated that the relevant criterion in that case was concerned with ""the circumstances in which the application is made"". The 12 month cohabitation requirement is also clearly concerned with the circumstances in which the application is made. This requirement may only be waived if there are circumstances sufficiently compassionate and compelling which would justify the parties having lodged the visa application before they had lived together in a spousal relationship for a sufficient period to satisfy the definition of spouse under regulation 1.15A. If the Tribunal was to take into account compassionate and compelling circumstances which apply only at the time of the decision it would be, in effect, making a determination in relation a [ sic ] time of application requirement by reference to facts which did not yet exist at the time of application. Such a determination would entirely undermine the two-stage assessment process which underpins the regulations. That is, an assessment of relevant factors which exist at the time of application and a later assessment of factors which exist at the time of decision.' 46 At [77], the Tribunal purported to apply Boakye-Danquah in assessing whether there were compelling and compassionate circumstances justifying what it called 'the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement at the time of application.' It expressed a finding that the only circumstances which could properly be taken into account 'in determining whether to exercise the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement are those circumstances which applied at the time of application.' After referring to other authority, the Tribunal then said at [81]: 'Policy provides that, in assessing whether there are compelling and compassionate reasons, officers are to take into account the circumstances which the Minister considers to be compelling and compassionate which includes, but is not limited to, applicants who have a dependent child of the relationship. The parties should be given the opportunity to present information as to why they consider there are compelling and compassionate reasons to waive the one year pre-existing cohabitation requirement. However, it is the policy intention that an assessment that the parties' relationship is genuine would not, in the absence of a dependent child of the relationship, be sufficiently compelling to justify not applying regulation 1.15A(2)(d) requirements.' 47 At [82], the Tribunal found that there were no dependent children of the relationship, and that there was no evidence that the parties were affected by extreme hardship at the time of application or that they would suffer irreparable prejudice if the 12-month cohabitation period were not waived. It referred to the relationship between Mr Petrou and the two children of his former marriage and to the fact that he had lived away from them for some time. It took the view that Mr Petrou would be able to prepare his children psychologically for his departure from Australia to be with Ms Antipova. The Tribunal found that it was not satisfied that a close relationship existed between Mr Petrou and his children at the time of application and was not satisfied that the relationship amounted to compassionate and compelling circumstances at that time. It was also not satisfied that the current needs of Mr Petrou's children were sufficiently compelling to justify a waiver of the 12-month cohabitation requirement, even if it could properly take those circumstances into account. 48 Three documents filed on behalf of Ms Antipova, and oral submissions of her counsel at the hearing of the proceeding, disclosed a great variety of approaches to the case put on her behalf. Some of the points raised can be dealt with very briefly, whereas others require a more detailed examination. The three documents are the amended application, filed on 8 June 2004, contentions of fact and law, also filed on 8 June 2004, and contentions in response to the respondent's supplementary contentions, filed on 2 May 2005. 103 The Tribunal construed this provision as a 'waiver' provision, and held that it was required to take into account only those circumstances existing at the date of the application for a visa. In doing so, the Tribunal said that it was following Boakye-Danquah . That was a case concerned with criteria for a particular type of visa, found in a schedule to the Migration Regulations , in which the reference to 'compelling reasons' appeared in the very criterion required to be satisfied at the time of application for the visa. That provision referred to compelling reasons for not applying certain otherwise applicable criteria. It is not surprising that Wilcox J in that case construed the relevant provision as requiring the compelling reasons to exist at the time of application for the visa. 104 Regulation 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations is a very different provision. It is found in a separate regulation, providing a definition of the word 'spouse', for a variety of purposes, wherever that word is found in the Migration Regulations . It does not call upon a decision-maker to determine 'whether to exercise the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement', as the Tribunal characterised it at [77] of its reasons. Rather, reg 1.15A(2A) provides that reg 1.15A(2)(d) does not apply if a specified condition is met. That condition is not that the applicant can establish compelling and compassionate reasons for not applying the criteria referred to in reg 1.15A(2)(d), but that the applicant can establish 'compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa.' In other words, the Tribunal is not required to determine whether compelling and compassionate circumstances exist for the waiver or non-application of the 12-month requirement, but whether such circumstances exist for the granting of the visa sought. The focus is not on the criteria to be ousted from consideration, but on the end result. The wording of reg 1.15A(2A) suggests strongly that, at whatever stage of whatever decision-making process the question of special circumstances arises, it is to be determined by reference to whatever circumstances exist at the date of decision. It would be a strange result if the circumstances to be considered differed according to whether the application of the definition of 'spouse' was required to be applied at the time of application of the visa, or at the time of decision, or at some other stage, so that different views might be taken as to whether compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa existed at different times. The wording of the provision suggests strongly that this is not the intention. 105 Applying this view does nothing to undermine the two-stage assessment process of determining entitlement to the type of visa Ms Antipova sought, as the Tribunal suggested at [76] of its reasons. Even assuming the definition in reg 1.15A of the Migration Regulations to be confined in its application to that type of visa (and subreg (2)(d) in its terms applies to a range of types of visas, including any permanent visa), the two-stage process remains intact. In determining whether the applicant for a visa was the spouse of a nominating person at the date of application for the visa, the decision-maker is required to determine whether, throughout a 12-month period prior to that date, the two persons met the three requirements of reg 1.15A(2)(d), namely mutual commitment, genuine and continuing relationship, and cohabitation. If any of these three requirements should be absent, the decision-maker is then required to consider whether the applicant has established compelling and compassionate reasons for the grant of the visa. If so, reg 1.15A(2)(d) no longer has to be satisfied at the date of application for the visa; it no longer applies. Once understood in this sense, reg 1.15A(2A) can be seen to be compatible with the two-stage process of assessment. On this analysis, there is nothing strange about making a determination about the application of a criterion to be satisfied at the time of application for a visa by reference to facts not in existence at that time, as the Tribunal thought. 107 At [24], North J expressed the view that it was not to be expected that a decision-maker would be required to ignore the current state of affairs, unless the legislation expressly required such an exercise to be undertaken. At [25], his Honour referred to the fact that reg 3A(2) was an ameliorating provision, which suggested that it should be given an expansive, rather than a restrictive, meaning. At [26], his Honour regarded any uncertainty arising from applying the assessment on the facts as they exist at the time of the decision, rather than at the time of the application, as insufficient to outweigh the intended ameliorating purpose of the regulation. His Honour did not refer to Boakye-Danquah . In many respects, the provision with which North J was dealing in Neofotistou was more similar to that with which Wilcox J was dealing in Boakye-Danquah than either is to reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations. Despite the fact that North J appears to have been unaware of Boakye-Danquah , I regard Neofotistou as correct, and as supporting the view I take of reg 1.15A(2A). As I have said, Boakye-Danquah is distinguishable, because it dealt with a provision very different from reg 1.15A(2A). 108 The Tribunal appears to have been led into error by its misunderstanding of the principle for which Boakye-Danquah stood as authority, and by its incorrect characterisation of reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations, at [76] of the Tribunal's reasons, as permitting waiver of the criteria in reg 1.15A(2)(d) 'if there are circumstances sufficiently compassionate and compelling which would justify the parties having lodged the visa application before they had lived together in a spousal relationship for a sufficient period to satisfy the definition of spouse under regulation 1.15A.' As I have said in [104], reg 1.15A(2A) did not focus on the circumstances attending the making of the application for a visa, but on the circumstances justifying the granting of the visa. Those circumstances are the ones the Tribunal was required to take into account in determining whether the criteria in reg 1.15A(2)(d) was applicable. 109 Such an error is capable of amounting to a jurisdictional error if it affected the exercise of the Tribunal's statutory function. In the present case, the issue of compelling and compassionate circumstances turned on Mr Petrou's re-established relationship with his children from a former union, and on Ms Antipova's emerging relationship with those children. The Tribunal was prepared to take into account the needs of those children in determining whether compelling and compassionate circumstances existed. Having held that it could not take into account the circumstances that existed at the date of decision, the Tribunal nevertheless expressed the view at [82] of its reasons that, even if it could do so, it did not regard the current needs of the children as 'sufficiently compelling to justify a waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement'. Despite the incorrect characterisation of the effect of reg 1.15A(2A), it is fair to take this finding to be a finding that there were no compelling and compassionate circumstances, for the purposes of the application of that provision, even if current circumstances were to be considered. The assessment of the circumstances against the standard of 'compelling and compassionate' was a matter for the Tribunal. It does not appear that the Tribunal misunderstood or misapplied the required standard. The result, therefore, is the same as if the Tribunal had not held erroneously that it could not take circumstances at the time of the decision into account. In effect, it did so. Its error did not amount to a jurisdictional error, because it did carry out the task required of it by the legislation. 110 For this reason, the Tribunal's decision cannot be set aside on the basis of its error in construing reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations."
Case852,cited,Nassouh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 788,"In determining whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had been in a de facto relationship for 12 months or more prior to the visa application, the Tribunal was bound to have regard to all of the matters referred to in reg 1.15A(3) of the Migration Regulations . That subregulation so provides and, as the Tribunal pointed out at [48] of its reasons, the mandatory nature of the provision was emphasised in Nassouh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 788 at [10] . In conformity with its obligation, the Tribunal discussed in its reasons for decision each of those matters, to the extent to which there was evidence before the Tribunal relating to them. It did so under headings reflecting the requirements of pars (a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively of reg 1.15A(3). This arrangement of the Tribunal's reasons for decision makes it difficult for Ms Antipova to sustain the argument that the Tribunal failed to consider the mandatory considerations. 61 In its consideration of the financial aspects of the relationship, required by reg 1.15A(3)(a) of the Migration Regulations , the Tribunal first found that there was no evidence that, in the 12-month period it was considering, the parties combined their financial affairs or shared assets or liabilities. It acknowledged that Ms Antipova had given a reason for the lack of a joint bank account, namely that she and Mr Petrou had little money and there was no need. The Tribunal pointed out that there was no documentary evidence of shared household or daily living expenses in the relevant 12-month period, but appeared to accept that it would have been impractical to have had such evidence, because Mr Petrou was the sole lessee of the six-bedroom house in California in which Ms Antipova claimed to have lived with him and others. The Tribunal clearly did not focus solely on whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had a joint bank account, as the submissions on behalf of Ms Antipova suggested. Nor did it ignore evidence of the joint burden of debt for legal expenses, loans and university fees. To the extent that such a joint burden might have existed, it plainly did not exist during the 12 months preceding the application for a visa. Indeed, as late as 1 September 2003, Ms Antipova's migration agent (who was also, apparently, a legal practitioner) submitted in writing to the Tribunal the statement that Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou 'do not have joint financial commitments because of their parlous financial position.' The Tribunal could hardly have made any finding other than the one it made on this aspect of the case. In weighing the credibility of Ms Antipova's case, the Tribunal was certainly entitled to use material that Ms Antipova had supplied to it, concerning the travel undertaken by her and Mr Petrou, when testing their assertion that, because they had very little money, they did not open a joint bank account and Ms Antipova did not apply for a divorce from her former husband. The material was relevant to this issue, and there was no element of conjecture involved in the Tribunal's reliance on it. 62 In considering the social aspects of the relationship during the 12-month period, as required by reg 1.15A(3)(c) of the Migration Regulations , the Tribunal dealt expressly with the material supplied by Ms Antipova from friends and family. As I have already pointed out, it gave little weight to the statements of Ms Downie, Ms Shpits and Ms Karagoz. It did not reject the statements as evidence that family and friends considered Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou to be a couple, and thereby used the statements for the purpose for which they were required under the regulation, and for the purpose for which they had been supplied to it. The Tribunal did point out, however, that the statements of Mr Petrou's parents did not bear upon whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou were living together at the relevant time. Since this was the crucial issue, the Tribunal could not be criticised for making this observation, although it did so under the heading dealing with the social aspects of the relationship, rather than under the earlier heading, dealing with the nature of the household, including the living arrangements. The Tribunal did not fail to consider the evidence of travel itineraries, air tickets and passport copies, as Ms Antipova contended. It detailed every document in its reasons for decision. The material indicated that the parties travelled together in March 2002. Although evidence of later events can sometimes cast light on the nature of a relationship at an earlier time, it is hard to see, and counsel for Ms Antipova never explained, how the evidence of joint travel in March 2002 could bear upon the nature of the relationship between Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou in May and June 2001. The Tribunal was not bound to look at this material in relation to the issue of the social aspects of the relationship at the relevant time."
Case853,followed,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 (1999) 197 CLR 611,"The contention that the Tribunal failed to act in accordance with substantial justice and the merits of the case, as it was required to do by s 353(2)(b) of the Migration Act , also appears to be an attempt to reargue the merits, and therefore impermissible. In Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [46] [52] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J (Hayne J concurring at [158]), [69] [77] per Gaudron and Kirby JJ, [106] [109] per Gummow J, and [175] [179] per Callinan J, the High Court held that s 420 of the Migration Act was insufficiently specific to constitute a ground for review of a decision under the limited jurisdiction then given to this Court by s 476 of the Migration Act , which has since been repealed. Section 420 makes provisions with respect to the Refugee Review Tribunal in terms identical to those made by s 353 with respect to the Tribunal. For reasons similar to those given in Eshetu , s 353 is unlikely to be the source of an obligation, failure to comply with which could be said to constitute jurisdictional error. 67 A consideration of whether the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by misleading Ms Antipova about what was in issue requires an examination of further factual matters. On 6 August 2002, Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou were interviewed separately by an officer of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (subsequently the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs) (in both cases, 'the Department'). The notes of the interview record that Ms Antipova was asked when and where she moved in with Mr Petrou. Her answer was 18 May 2001, and she gave the address of the premises at which Mr Petrou lived in California. The officer asked if she had any other documents that would support this claim, and Ms Antipova said that she did not. By letter dated 16 August 2002, the officer referred to a request on 6 August 2002 'to provide further evidence of cohabitation within 28 days' and requested certain specified documents. With a letter dated 6 September 2002, Ms Antipova's migration agent provided the statutory declarations of Mr Petrou's parents, the statement of Ms Karagoz and a statement of Mr Petrou. With a letter dated 15 October 2002, the migration agent provided the letter of Ms Downie dated 15 August 2002. 68 The decision of the Minister's delegate to refuse to grant Ms Antipova a visa was accompanied by written reasons, dated 3 January 2003. According to those reasons, the delegate found 'conflicting information about the extent of commitment of this relationship since May 2001'. The delegate found that there was 'inadequate evidence...to support claims of a de facto marital relationship to have been in existence for at least 12 months prior to the date of application' for the visa [underlining in original]. It was for this reason that the delegate decided that Ms Antipova was not entitled to the visa."

Case856,followed,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553,"There are two possible answers to this question. The first is that s 360(1) of the Migration Act requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant 'to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.' If the Tribunal has conducted what purports to be a hearing, but has not in truth allowed an applicant to give evidence and present arguments relating to those issues, it has not complied with this statutory obligation. The Tribunal has failed to comply with an essential precondition to making a decision on the applicant's application to review the decision of the Minister's delegate, and has therefore failed to perform the duty, conferred on it by s 348 of the Migration Act , to review that decision. Its decision is invalid and must be set aside. This is the reasoning followed by the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [33] [41], in relation to s 425(1) of the Migration Act , which imposes on the Refugee Review Tribunal an obligation in terms identical with the obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s 360(1). At [33], the Full Court approved the statement of Goldberg J in Mazhar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 (2000) 183 ALR 188 at [31] that: 'The invitation must not be a hollow shell or an empty gesture.' 84 In SCAR at [38], the Full Court recognised that compliance with s 425 is a 'precondition to the valid exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction', and that failure to comply involves a jurisdictional error. At [41], the Full Court found that the Refugee Review Tribunal in that case had not extended 'a meaningful invitation'. 85 In the present case, because it interrupted her and imposed an arbitrary time limit on her, the Tribunal did not permit Ms Antipova to give evidence and present arguments as she wished to do. Although there was a semblance of a hearing, and the Tribunal invited Ms Antipova to it in terms mandated by s 360(1) of the Migration Act , the invitation was not a real and meaningful one, because what she was invited to do was denied to her. The Tribunal failed to observe a precondition of the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it. Its decision was made without an invitation to attend a hearing of the kind required, because such a hearing has not yet been conducted. 86 Counsel for the Minister submitted that SCAR has been the subject of judicial criticism, and even that it has been not followed. Reference was made to WAJR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 (2004) 204 ALR 624, in which French J distinguished SCAR on the facts at [46]. At [57] [59], his Honour discussed the question whether s 422B of the Migration Act operated to preclude the application of the principles of procedural fairness in the context of the failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to ask any questions at the hearing as to a particular issue on which it later found adversely to the person seeking a protection visa. In the course of that discussion, his Honour examined whether there had been a failure to comply with s 425 of the Migration Act . In the alternative, his Honour examined the issue on the assumption that s 425 had no application, holding that the denial of procedural fairness in that case amounted to jurisdictional error, notwithstanding s 422B. Nothing that his Honour said in that passage amounted to a criticism of SCAR , or a refusal to follow it. Indeed, at [58], his Honour affirmed the central propositions for which SCAR stands, saying: 'A failure to conduct a hearing of the kind contemplated by s 425 in my opinion would amount to a failure to comply with the obligation imposed by that section upon the tribunal to invite an applicant to participate in such a hearing. That obligation is so central to the conduct of the tribunal process that it necessarily conditions the power to make an adverse decision on review.' 87 In M17/2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 86 (2005) 85 ALD 597, Ryan J also dealt with the alleged failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to raise at the hearing an issue on which it later found against the person applying for a protection visa. At [58], his Honour accepted that compliance with s 425 was held in SCAR to be a precondition to the valid exercise of the Refugee Review Tribunal's jurisdiction, and that failure to comply would therefore be jurisdictional error. At [59], his Honour quoted from the joint judgment of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Cho [1999] FCA 946 (1999) 92 FCR 315 at [29] , where their Honours said: 'In considering the extent of the requirements imposed by s 425 it is important to keep in mind that the exercise is essentially one of statutory interpretation...Care must be taken not to confuse the question of the interpretation of s 425 according to its language with a question as to whether the full range of natural justice requirements should be injected into s 425 under the guise of giving content to an obligation to afford an ""opportunity to give evidence"".' 90 At [62], Ryan J quoted from NALQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 at [30] , a passage in which the Full Court recognised that the invitation required by s 425 must be 'real and meaningful and not just an empty gesture', citing both SCAR and Mazhar . The Full Court in NALQ proceeded to discuss earlier authorities on the nature of the invitation required. At [34], there was a discussion of whether the Full Court in SCAR at [37] had misconstrued the judgment of Hely J in Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 (2003) 128 FCR 359, but the Full Court in NALQ did not determine this question. 91 This examination of the authorities demonstrates that, far from having been criticised or not followed, SCAR is very much in the mainstream of authority. The invitation required by s 425 of the Migration Act (and, for identical reasons, that required by s 360), must be real and genuine. As the reasoning of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Cho at [33] demonstrates, it is legitimate to examine what occurred at the hearing, in order to ascertain whether the invitation extended satisfies that requirement. If what took place under the guise of a hearing was not a genuine opportunity for an applicant for review 'to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to a decision under review', then the invitation required by s 425 (or s 360) will not have been extended as required. Of course, it is necessary to bear in mind, as Tamberlin and Katz JJ said in Cho at [29], that it is not legitimate to regard every want of procedural fairness as nullifying the invitation. It is only defects rendering the proceedings ineffective to fulfil the purpose for which the invitation is required that will have this effect. SCAR is therefore binding on me as a single judge. In any event, in my view, it is correctly decided. 93 If SCAR is wrongly decided, and s 360(1) of the Migration Act is not to be given the meaning it bears in my opinion, it is necessary to consider the second answer to the question whether s 357A of the Migration Act ousts the right, which Ms Antipova would have otherwise, to establish that the Tribunal's unfairness to her constitutes jurisdictional error, entitling her to have the Tribunal's decision set aside. Section 357A is a difficult provision to construe. It does not exclude altogether the principles of procedural fairness. There must be some doubt as to whether Parliament could exclude procedural fairness altogether, given that a denial of procedural fairness is a ground for the remedies referred to in s 75(v) of the Constitution . At best, the legislative power extends to regulating procedures, and this is what s 357A attempts to do. It provides that Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act is taken to be 'an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with'. The provision assumes that there will be aspects of the 'natural justice hearing rule' that are not matters dealt with by any provision of Div 5. As the cases so far have shown, identifying a provision dealing with a particular 'matter', relating to procedural fairness is not always easy. See, for example, the passages in WAJR , to which I have referred in [86]. The present case is relatively easy. No provision of Div 5 deals with the imposition of time limits on the hearings of the Tribunal. Unless it be s 360(1) , no provision deals with the process by which evidence is adduced at a Tribunal hearing. There is certainly no provision dealing with the 'matter' of a Tribunal member interrupting answers to questions. No provision gives the Tribunal member a right to control and censor the evidence given, by refusing to hear what the applicant for review wishes to say."

Obviously if there is no real opportunity given then the section has not been complied with. This could arise, for example, where relevant evidence is not admitted or misleading statements are made by the decision-maker which discourage an applicant from calling or proceeding with a particular line of evidence.' 91 This examination of the authorities demonstrates that, far from having been criticised or not followed, SCAR is very much in the mainstream of authority. The invitation required by s 425 of the Migration Act (and, for identical reasons, that required by s 360), must be real and genuine. As the reasoning of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Cho at [33] demonstrates, it is legitimate to examine what occurred at the hearing, in order to ascertain whether the invitation extended satisfies that requirement. If what took place under the guise of a hearing was not a genuine opportunity for an applicant for review 'to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to a decision under review', then the invitation required by s 425 (or s 360) will not have been extended as required. Of course, it is necessary to bear in mind, as Tamberlin and Katz JJ said in Cho at [29], that it is not legitimate to regard every want of procedural fairness as nullifying the invitation. It is only defects rendering the proceedings ineffective to fulfil the purpose for which the invitation is required that will have this effect. SCAR is therefore binding on me as a single judge. In any event, in my view, it is correctly decided."

Case865,discussed,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61,"Since writing these reasons for judgment, I have become aware of the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61. That judgment deals with an appeal by the Minister from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, which quashed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse a Business Skills Migrant visa to the respondent to the appeal, a person who had applied from outside Australia for that visa. The issue was whether the respondent had been denied what the Full Court called 'common law procedural fairness', because the decision-maker did not draw to the respondent's attention the point on which the decision against him turned. If the respondent were entitled to succeed on that issue, there was then an issue as to whether a right to procedural fairness was excluded by s 51A of the Migration Act , a provision in terms similar to both s 357A and s 422B , but relating to decisions by the Minister or delegates of the Minister. At [46] [59], the Full Court held that there had been no denial of procedural fairness, because the relevant point was obvious to the respondent. The Full Court then proceeded, at [60] [70], to make some observations, which are clearly obiter, on the effect of s 51A. Following VXDC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 (2005) 146 FCR 562, the Full Court expressed the view that s 51A operates to exclude the 'common law natural justice hearing rule' altogether. 97 To the extent to which Lay Lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357A of the Migration Act , it does not bind me to hold that Ms Antipova's only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act . In my view, to the extent that it suggests that s 422B excludes all principles of procedural fairness, other than those found in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act , VXDC is fundamentally wrong. The obiter remarks in Lay Lat are entitled to great respect, appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a Full Court, but I cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct. For the reasons I gave in Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170 at [28] , I remain of the view that the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with', appearing in each of ss 51A , 357A and 422B of the Migration Act are intended to qualify the words preceding them, and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words. If this were not the case, the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with' would be otiose, and it is not to be supposed that Parliament intended to enact meaningless, surplus words in a crucial amendment. The words are not the 'plain words of necessary intendment' required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness. See Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, and the authorities there cited. It is highly unlikely that Parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness, a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case, could arise. The present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in Lay Lat were to be followed. Assuming that s 360(1) of the Migration Act does not have the meaning that it has in my view, the Tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose, interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly, and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case, and the applicant would have no redress. It is impossible to imagine that Parliament intended such a drastic result. 98 To the extent to which the views expressed in VXDC and Lay Lat are said to be based on a reading of the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech relating to the bill by which ss 51A , 357A and 422B were introduced into the Migration Act , I repeat the view I expressed in Moradian at [35]. Those documents do not contain statements specific enough to resolve any ambiguity in those provisions, or to disclose a purpose specific enough to warrant a construction of the provisions that would regard them as excluding the entirety of the principle of procedural fairness described as the 'natural justice hearing rule'. 99 For these reasons, if it is necessary to ask the question whether Ms Antipova is entitled to succeed on the basis that the Tribunal denied her procedural fairness, by the manner in which it conducted her hearing, I do not regard VXDC and Lay Lat as requiring me to take a view different from that I have expressed above."

Case869,followed,Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141,"It is therefore necessary to see whether the particular denial of procedural fairness made a difference, in the sense referred to in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 147, ie whether the Tribunal's error deprived Ms Antipova 'of the possibility of a successful outcome.' In the present case, the answer is plain. The Tribunal disbelieved Ms Antipova when she said that she was determined to make a life with Mr Petrou from the time she went to live with him on 18 May 2001. To a significant extent, the Tribunal's reasoning in this respect was based on its refusal to accept Ms Antipova's explanation of how she had come to continue with her marriage plans after meeting Mr Petrou, and then abandoned her marriage so soon after she had undertaken it. It was this very question that Ms Antipova was attempting to answer when the Tribunal member interrupted her, on several occasions, and asked her for a less detailed answer. If the Tribunal had been patient enough to listen to the detail, it might well have been persuaded to accept what Ms Antipova said. In other words, the very point on which Ms Antipova lost, because she was disbelieved, is one on which she would have given a fuller explanation, if the Tribunal had permitted her to do so. It cannot be said that the denial of procedural fairness in truncating Ms Antipova's evidence, to fit within a timetable about which she had not been warned, could have made no difference to the outcome of the proceeding. 101 It follows that the performance of the Tribunal's statutory function was affected by the denial of procedural fairness. The Tribunal's decision is therefore tainted by jurisdictional error, either because of its failure to comply with s 360 of the Migration Act , or because of a denial of procedural fairness, which s 357A of the Migration Act does not exclude from consideration. 102 Once the Tribunal had found that Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had not been in a marriage-like relationship for 12 months before Ms Antipova applied for her visa, it was necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether reg 1.15A(2A)(b) of the Migration Regulations applied. The effect of that provision was that the requirements of reg 1.15A(2)(d) (in this case, the requirement of a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others for a period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of the application for a visa) did not apply if Ms Antipova could 'establish compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa.'"
Case870,followed,Neofotistou v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 919 (2005) 144 FCR 478,"In Neofotistou v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 919 (2005) 144 FCR 478 at [19] [28], the Court took a view similar to the one I have expressed, with respect to the provisions of reg 3A of the Migration Regulations 1989 (Cth). Regulation 3A(2) provided for the specification of a lesser period than the six-month period of cohabitation prior to the date of application for a visa, required by reg 3A(1), if : '(a) there are exceptional circumstances affecting the persons; and (b) there are compelling reasons for specifying that lesser period.' 107 At [24], North J expressed the view that it was not to be expected that a decision-maker would be required to ignore the current state of affairs, unless the legislation expressly required such an exercise to be undertaken. At [25], his Honour referred to the fact that reg 3A(2) was an ameliorating provision, which suggested that it should be given an expansive, rather than a restrictive, meaning. At [26], his Honour regarded any uncertainty arising from applying the assessment on the facts as they exist at the time of the decision, rather than at the time of the application, as insufficient to outweigh the intended ameliorating purpose of the regulation. His Honour did not refer to Boakye-Danquah . In many respects, the provision with which North J was dealing in Neofotistou was more similar to that with which Wilcox J was dealing in Boakye-Danquah than either is to reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations. Despite the fact that North J appears to have been unaware of Boakye-Danquah , I regard Neofotistou as correct, and as supporting the view I take of reg 1.15A(2A). As I have said, Boakye-Danquah is distinguishable, because it dealt with a provision very different from reg 1.15A(2A)."
Case871,followed,Webb v R [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41,"Nor does it appear that the Tribunal's decision can be set aside on the ground of bias. The ground was raised, but not argued in detail. The test for ostensible bias as a ground for setting aside a decision of the Tribunal is whether a fair-minded lay observer with knowledge of the material objective facts might entertain a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question in issue. See Webb v R [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 67-68 per Deane J. In my view, a fair-minded lay observer, informed as to the material objective facts, who witnessed the Tribunal dealing with Ms Antipova's case, would have been more likely to conclude that the Tribunal had simply not performed its statutory function very well, rather than that it would fail to bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of Ms Antipova's case. The insistence on imposing a time limit, and the associated interruptions and attempts to shorten the evidence, were indicative of a desire to deal with the matter expeditiously, rather than of a desire to find against Ms Antipova, whatever the evidence might reveal. Nothing about the Tribunal's reasoning discloses that it approached the case with a closed mind. 112 For the reasons I have given, the Tribunal's decision is flawed by reason of its jurisdictional error. That error consists of failure to comply with the essential precondition to the exercise of the jurisdiction, provided by s 360(1) of the Migration Act , that the Tribunal invite the applicant to appear before it, to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. Although the Tribunal gave Ms Antipova such an invitation in form, because of the manner in which it conducted the hearing, there was no such invitation in reality. Alternatively, the Tribunal denied Ms Antipova procedural fairness by the manner in which it conducted the hearing, and the denial of procedural fairness is such as to amount to jurisdictional error. Ms Antipova is entitled to have the decision set aside, and to have the Tribunal rehear her application for review of the decision of the Minister's delegate."
Case872,cited,SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162,"Among the relief Ms Antipova seeks is a writ of certiorari, for the purpose of quashing the Tribunal's decision, as well as an order remitting the matter to the Tribunal for determination according to law (in reality, a writ of mandamus, or an order in the nature of mandamus). Relief of these kinds can only be granted against the Tribunal, which is not a party to the proceeding. See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [43] per McHugh J, [91] per Gummow J, [153] per Kirby J and [180] per Hayne J. It will therefore be necessary for me to make an order joining the Tribunal as the second respondent to the proceeding. It is safe to assume that the Tribunal would follow the usual practice of submitting to any order that the Court might make, save an order for costs against the Tribunal. Service of the application and associated material on the Tribunal can therefore be dispensed with. A writ of certiorari should issue, directed to the Tribunal, bringing the decision into the Court, for the purpose of quashing it. The decision should be quashed. A writ of mandamus should also issue, directed to the Tribunal, requiring it to hear and determine the application of Ms Antipova for review of the decision of the Minister according to law. 114 No reason was advanced, and none appears, why the usual order, that costs follow the event, should not be made. The Minister will be ordered to pay Ms Antipova's costs of the proceeding.

Case875,cited,British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 3 All ER 816,"Secondly, equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained , especially where the information is used as a ""springboard for a claim or defence in litigation"": Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 at [15] - [17] . As Emmett J noted in MM , there is nothing to prevent the holder of a claim for privilege making a privilege claim prior to the tendering of evidence against the holder of any information obtained by ASIC in circumstances not giving rise to a waiver: eg ss 76 - 83 of the ASIC Act ; ss 118 and 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 3 All ER 816. Put another way, ""the right of the holder of the privilege not to have privileged material used in evidence against him or her [or it]"" is not affected by the disclosure of the privileged material by a party within the scope of the privilege but not entitled to control its exercise: MM at [38]. This is a natural consequence of the basic principle that only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Moreover, although not applicable in the present case (because the third party here is a corporation, which has no privilege against self-incrimination: Daniels at [31]), that preservation of privilege extends not only to legal professional privilege but also privilege against self-incrimination because the ASIC Act abrogates privilege against self-incrimination (s 68(1)) and then provides a ""use immunity"" to the examinee in relation to information obtained in a s 19 examination where the requirements of s 68(2) are satisfied: s 68(3) of the ASIC Act . Interestingly, unlike other Commonwealth legislation, the ""use immunity"" in the ASIC Act only applies to persons in relation to the making of an oral statement or the signing of a record and not to the production of documents: s 76(1)(d) of the ASIC Act ; see also Privilege in Perspective , ALRC Report No 107 (2007) at Ch 7 and in particular, paras [7.65] [7.69] and [7.103] and [7.104]."
Case876,cited,Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd (2008) 246 ALR 137,"In the course of argument, ASIC appeared to suggest there were qualifications to the general proposition that the ASIC Act did not abrogate legal professional privilege. The qualifications were, first, that the ASIC Act is silent as to whether a person other than a lawyer may refuse to give information on the ground that it would disclose a communication for which the person claims legal privilege. If that observation by ASIC was intended to provide support for a contention that an individual, not a lawyer, could be compelled by ASIC to disclose information for which the individual had a claim for legal professional privilege, then that contention is rejected. It is rejected because it finds no support in the Act and is contrary to authority ( Daniels ). There is no basis for distinguishing between a lawyer and an individual in the context of legal professional privilege. So much is made clear from the express words of s 69 of the ASIC Act . In the circumstances specified (which includes ASIC's powers of investigation, examination and information gathering in Pt 3) , a lawyer may refuse to comply with a requirement to give information or produce a book, where to do so would involve the disclosure of a privileged communication with the lawyer in their capacity as a lawyer "" unless ... the person to whom, or by or on behalf of whom, the communication was made consents to the lawyer complying with the requirement"" (emphasis added): s 69(2). In other words, consistent with authority, the section proceeds on the premise that the holder of the privilege (being the client regardless of whether the client is an individual or a body corporate) must consent to the disclosure of the privilege it holds. No other party is able to waive the privilege; it is the holder of the privilege (the client) that must act inconsistently with the maintenance of that privilege for privilege to be waived: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [17]. Any other result is contrary to the fundamental principles summarised in [21] and [22] above. 26 On the assumption that, at the outset of a s 19 examination, ASIC told an examinee that legal professional privilege may be availed of by that person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents that would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, then disclosure by an examinee or witness of information in which he or she holds the privilege would constitute an act inconsistent with the maintenance of that privilege and privilege would be waived: see Cadbury 246 ALR 137 at [13]. So much may be accepted. It is consistent with the established principles on waiver. 27 If ASIC's submission is intended to suggest that if that same person (for example, an employee, director, consultant to, but not a legal adviser of, a third party) was privy to the privileged communications of the third party, then ASIC could compel production of that privileged information, that contention should be rejected for the reasons outlined in [21] and [22] above."
Case877,cited,Commodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub [1985] USSC 102 ; 471 US 343 (1985),"If, however, ASIC meant to submit not that it could compel a person (here, an employee or former employee) to disclose a third party's (here, a company's) privilege by force of statute, but rather that the person may lack the standing to assert the third party's privilege, then that contention may be accepted. Just as an employee can only waive a corporation's privilege if he or she has authority to do so (typically, where the person is a current officer or director), so too may an employee only assert a claim of privilege belonging to a corporation if he or she has the requisite authority: Commodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub [1985] USSC 102 ; 471 US 343 , 348-49 (1985); In re Grand Jury Proceedings [2006] USCA1 234 ; 469 F3d 24 (1 st Cir 2006); Wrench LLC v Taco Bell Corporation 212 FRD 514 , 517 (WD Mich 2002) (collecting cases); see also S McNicol, Law of Privilege (1992) at 161-62 (citing Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 153 CLR 134 for the proposition that an employee cannot assert the privilege of self-incrimination on behalf of a corporation [at that time corporations were still thought to have such a privilege] because the privilege is personal to the holder). To put it another way, the ASIC investigator was legally correct when he told counsel for AWB that ""[n]either ... could [the employees] make the claim [of privilege on behalf of AWB] nor [could they] waive the claim..."": [12] above."
Case878,discussed,Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301,"However that may be, the fact of the matter is that ASIC now has possession of information which, at least in theory, could be subject to a valid claim of privilege by AWB. The question then is whether ASIC is entitled to make use of that information, notwithstanding the possible privilege claim, and the answer to that question is yes. As the Court of Appeal in Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 said (at [32]): [A]lthough it is now accepted that legal professional privilege is more than just a rule of evidence or procedure, it is clear that it is not to be characterised as a rule of law conferring individual rights sounding in damages or an injunction to restrain an apprehended or continued breach [ Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 565 (Gummow J)]. Consequently, once information in a privileged document has come into the hands of a party to litigation, even as a result of compulsive process which is later reversed, the fact that the document was and remains privileged does not of itself prevent that party from making use of the information [ Calcraft v Guest [1898] 1 QB 759, 763-4; Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 (Gibbs CJ, in diss ), 67, 80 (Mason J, in diss ) 101, 109-110 (Brennan J in diss ), 129 (Dawson J); Trevorrow v State of South Australia (No 4) (2006) 94 SASR 64 , 70 (Doyle CJ), 80 (Debelle J), 101 (White J); Heydon, Cross on Evidence , 7 th Aust Ed (2004) [25025]. 40 Secondly, equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained , especially where the information is used as a ""springboard for a claim or defence in litigation"": Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 at [15] - [17] . As Emmett J noted in MM , there is nothing to prevent the holder of a claim for privilege making a privilege claim prior to the tendering of evidence against the holder of any information obtained by ASIC in circumstances not giving rise to a waiver: eg ss 76 - 83 of the ASIC Act ; ss 118 and 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 3 All ER 816. Put another way, ""the right of the holder of the privilege not to have privileged material used in evidence against him or her [or it]"" is not affected by the disclosure of the privileged material by a party within the scope of the privilege but not entitled to control its exercise: MM at [38]. This is a natural consequence of the basic principle that only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Moreover, although not applicable in the present case (because the third party here is a corporation, which has no privilege against self-incrimination: Daniels at [31]), that preservation of privilege extends not only to legal professional privilege but also privilege against self-incrimination because the ASIC Act abrogates privilege against self-incrimination (s 68(1)) and then provides a ""use immunity"" to the examinee in relation to information obtained in a s 19 examination where the requirements of s 68(2) are satisfied: s 68(3) of the ASIC Act . Interestingly, unlike other Commonwealth legislation, the ""use immunity"" in the ASIC Act only applies to persons in relation to the making of an oral statement or the signing of a record and not to the production of documents: s 76(1)(d) of the ASIC Act ; see also Privilege in Perspective , ALRC Report No 107 (2007) at Ch 7 and in particular, paras [7.65] [7.69] and [7.103] and [7.104]."
Case879,applied,Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543,"It is settled that ""legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law which may be availed of by a person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents which would reveal communications between a client or his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services"": Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 at [9] and [11] and the authorities cited. 23 In the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, legal professional privilege may be availed of to resist the giving of information or the production of documents in accordance with investigatory procedures of the kind contained in s 155 of the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) (""the TPA""): Daniels Corporation [2002] HCA 49 ; 213 CLR 543 at [10] and [11]. Despite differences in language between the TPA and the ASIC Act , no different result ensues. There is no express provision in the ASIC Act abrogating legal professional privilege. Moreover, there is nothing in the ASIC Act supporting the contention that the abrogation of legal professional privilege is a necessary implication: see eg ss 1(1) , 1 (2), 1 (3), Pt 3 and, in particular, ss 68 and 69 . 24 In the course of argument, ASIC appeared to suggest there were qualifications to the general proposition that the ASIC Act did not abrogate legal professional privilege. The qualifications were, first, that the ASIC Act is silent as to whether a person other than a lawyer may refuse to give information on the ground that it would disclose a communication for which the person claims legal privilege. If that observation by ASIC was intended to provide support for a contention that an individual, not a lawyer, could be compelled by ASIC to disclose information for which the individual had a claim for legal professional privilege, then that contention is rejected. It is rejected because it finds no support in the Act and is contrary to authority ( Daniels ). There is no basis for distinguishing between a lawyer and an individual in the context of legal professional privilege. So much is made clear from the express words of s 69 of the ASIC Act . In the circumstances specified (which includes ASIC's powers of investigation, examination and information gathering in Pt 3) , a lawyer may refuse to comply with a requirement to give information or produce a book, where to do so would involve the disclosure of a privileged communication with the lawyer in their capacity as a lawyer "" unless ... the person to whom, or by or on behalf of whom, the communication was made consents to the lawyer complying with the requirement"" (emphasis added): s 69(2). In other words, consistent with authority, the section proceeds on the premise that the holder of the privilege (being the client regardless of whether the client is an individual or a body corporate) must consent to the disclosure of the privilege it holds. No other party is able to waive the privilege; it is the holder of the privilege (the client) that must act inconsistently with the maintenance of that privilege for privilege to be waived: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [17]. Any other result is contrary to the fundamental principles summarised in [21] and [22] above. 29 In other words, I accept the contention that although ASIC cannot compel the production of legally privileged communications of a person (ie the ASIC Act does not override or abrogate legal professional privilege), that does not mean that ASIC cannot receive such communications under any circumstances. As ASIC contended, legal professional privilege affords a person immunity from compulsory disclosure of its privileged communication ( Daniels ). That immunity does not prevent receipt by ASIC in the circumstances of the present case of legally privileged information from the examinees and the witnesses where they were not the holder of the privilege. 40 Secondly, equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained , especially where the information is used as a ""springboard for a claim or defence in litigation"": Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 at [15] - [17] . As Emmett J noted in MM , there is nothing to prevent the holder of a claim for privilege making a privilege claim prior to the tendering of evidence against the holder of any information obtained by ASIC in circumstances not giving rise to a waiver: eg ss 76 - 83 of the ASIC Act ; ss 118 and 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 3 All ER 816.

Case883,followed,JMA Accounting Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 274 ; (2004) 139 FCR 537,"Secondly, a government agency or authority (such as ASIC) in the exercise of its compulsory powers must provide the person the subject of the exercise of the power with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege on his or her own behalf: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd (1989) 20 FCR 403 , 414 and MM v Australian Crime Commission (2007) 244 ALR 452 at [35]-[36]; but see JMA Accounting Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 274 ; (2004) 139 FCR 537 at [10] - [13] . Given the arrangements put in place by ASIC (see [9], [11] above), there was no (and could be no) complaint that the examinees were not provided with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege on their own behalf. 36 I should also note that examinees were even given an opportunity to raise an issue as to a possible third-party privilege. No doubt this is the best policy, but whether it was required as a matter of law may be doubted: see Rochfort at 145-47 (noting that in general effort should be made to respect potential interests of the third-party lawyer but that there are various circumstances where the interests of justice will trump protection of those interests). In MM , Emmett J held that a person must be given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of others as well as himself or herself. In support of this proposition, his Honour relied on the Full Court's decision in Citibank ; however, that decision was disapproved by the later Full Court decision in JMA . Moreover, the conclusion in MM rested on a premise which may be in doubt. Emmett J reasoned (at [35]) that an examinee ""would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might reasonably be expected to exist in order to ensure that such a claim for privilege would not be lost ."" (Emphasis added.) In other words, his Honour found that the obligation to make a claim on behalf of others must exist in order to prevent waiver. However, as I have already noted, and as the parties in this case recognised from the start, only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Thus there is no possibility that the failure of an employee to claim privilege on behalf of the corporation would result in waiver or loss of the privilege (except perhaps where the employee is authorised to waive the privilege). To the contrary, it is precisely if a general duty to claim the privilege is imposed that a risk of waiver arises - that is, imagine that an employee under a duty was given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of the employer but failed to do so; under Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 that would be conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege and would mean that any employee, without the knowledge or authority of the corporate employer, could waive the corporation's privilege. For those reasons, it does not seem either necessary or wise to impose a general obligation on an examinee to claim privilege on behalf of a third party, nor to create a general obligation on behalf of the examiner to give the examinee a reasonable opportunity to make such a claim. While an employee may have an obligation in contract or equity to maintain the confidences of his or her employer ( NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley (2001) 80 SASR 151 at [16]-[19]), that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer's legal professional privilege."
Case884,referred to,Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408,"In early 2008, ASIC received a request from the Australian Federal Police (""the AFP"") that it disclose certain information, including the AWB Information, to the AFP. AWB's solicitors learned of the request from a current employee and three former employees who had been examined by ASIC. Those current and former employees had been contacted by ASIC about the AFP request. ASIC informed them that ASIC was considering whether to provide the transcript of their s 19 examination to the AFP and, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 , provided each of them with an opportunity to be heard and to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the proposed release of the transcript of their s 19 examination to the AFP. 4 Upon learning of the proposed disclosure by ASIC, AWB wrote to ASIC on 1 April 2008 seeking an opportunity to be heard and to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the proposed release of information to the AFP including the conditions of the release. ASIC responded on 11 April 2008. At that time, the request was limited to the transcripts of the s 19 examinations. ASIC outlined the terms of the AFP request, its proposal to release the transcripts of the s 19 examinations to the AFP and the conditions upon which that information was proposed to be released. ASIC expressed the view that: It is ASIC's view that the protocols that were applied during the course of the section 19 ASIC Act examinations to ensure that information subject to a valid claim of legal professional privilege was not disclosed were sufficient, and that no privileged information was disclosed during the course of any examinations. ... Further, in light of the conditions on which ASIC proposes to release the examination transcripts to the AFP, and the secrecy provisions imposed on employees of the AFP by section 60A of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 Cth [sic], ASIC does not consider that [AWB's] interests in the confidentiality of any information provided to ASIC by examinees will be adversely affected by the proposed release. Although it is ASIC's view that ... [AWB's] interests will [not] be adversely affected by any decision to release the information to the AFP on the limited basis identified in paragraph 5 above, ASIC proposes to give [AWB] an opportunity to make submissions in relation to the conditions to be imposed on the disclosure of the transcripts of examinations of current or former employees of [AWB] to the AFP under section 127(4) of the ASIC Act . 5 ASIC and AWB's solicitors corresponded for some months. By July 2008, the AFP request had extended to disclosure of the witness statements that had been provided voluntarily by the employees and former employees of AWB. 45 However, that is not the end of the enquiry. The disclosure of the AWB Information by ASIC to the AFP was subject to conditions imposed under s 127(4A) (see [7] above). ASIC's s 127 power to disclose is discretionary: Johns at 428 and 469. The conditions are important. When, as here, conditions are imposed they are enforceable as an equitable obligation. The AFP is affected by the terms on which it received the AWB Information: Johns at 429. The obligation (expressed as a condition) is enforceable, at least, by injunction: Johns at 429. 46 The question which then arises is whether the disclosure of the AWB Information under s 127(4) requires ASIC to observe procedural fairness not only towards the examinee but also a party in the position of AWB consistent with the principles set out in Johns v ASC [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408. The exercise of the statutory power is conditional upon the observance of the rules of natural justice ( Johns at 470; Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 , 591 and Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 , 598), but does that natural justice requirement extend to AWB? 47 First, it must be recalled that the AWB Information was protected by disclosure (s 127(1)) subject to the qualifications prescribed in ss (2)-(4). That antecedent right or duty is not determinative. However, it is a relevant factor affecting the exercise by ASIC of its discretionary statutory power to disclose the AWB Information to the AFP. Exercise of the authority conferred by s 127(4) was ""apt to affect adversely"" the interests of the examinees who are prima facie entitled to have the transcripts kept confidential: Johns at 430. It was for that reason, consistent with Johns , that ASIC observed the rules of natural justice and informed each of the examinees that it proposed to disclose the transcripts and gave each examinee an opportunity to oppose: Johns at 430-431. 48 The present case, however, concerns not the examinee but AWB, the employer or previous employer of each examinee. In Johns , McHugh J said (at 472) that ""the need to preserve the confidentiality of ASIC's investigation does not exclude procedural fairness, but reduces its content, perhaps in some circumstances to nothing"". Here, the question of whether or not ASIC was obliged to observe the rules of natural justice in the case of AWB did not arise. Although AWB was not told by ASIC of the proposed disclosures to the AFP, it learned of that fact, was ""given the opportunity to put submissions before [ASIC] relating to matters requiring the non-disclosure of information by [ASIC]"" ( Johns at 472) and took advantage of that opportunity by making numerous submissions opposing the disclosure. AWB might have persuaded ASIC to accept or adopt its submissions. It did not. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to pursue McHugh J's observation to its end to determine precisely how much the content of procedural fairness may have been reduced with respect to AWB; I need only find (and do find) that the opportunity to be heard that was given to AWB was sufficient. 49 It follows from what I have just said that none of AWB's grounds of review is made out. The specific grounds are disposed of as follows. 50 There was no and could be no constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction or an absence of power contrary to ss 5(1)(c) and (d) of the ADJR Act . AWB's contentions that ASIC was ""[not] empowered by the ASIC Act to obtain confidential and privileged communications from persons other than the holder of the privilege in circumstances where the holder has not expressly or by implication waived the privilege"" is too broad a proposition. ASIC is not empowered to compel production from the privilege-holder and did not do so. 55 In my view, there was no denial of natural justice. AWB was ""given the opportunity to put submissions before [ASIC] relating to matters requiring the non-disclosure of information by [ASIC]"" ( Johns at 472) and took advantage of that opportunity by making numerous submissions opposing the disclosure. As I have found, this opportunity to be heard was enough to satisfy any requirements of natural justice in the circumstances: see [47] above. Moreover, it is of the utmost importance to recall that in a proceeding of this nature it is neither necessary nor right to decide the merits of the decision. 56 For those reasons, I would dismiss the application and order the applicant to pay the respondent's costs to be taxed in default of agreement. I certify that the preceding fifty-six (56) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gordon.

In MM , Emmett J held that a person must be given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of others as well as himself or herself. In support of this proposition, his Honour relied on the Full Court's decision in Citibank ; however, that decision was disapproved by the later Full Court decision in JMA . Moreover, the conclusion in MM rested on a premise which may be in doubt. Emmett J reasoned (at [35]) that an examinee ""would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might reasonably be expected to exist in order to ensure that such a claim for privilege would not be lost ."" (Emphasis added.) In other words, his Honour found that the obligation to make a claim on behalf of others must exist in order to prevent waiver. However, as I have already noted, and as the parties in this case recognised from the start, only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Thus there is no possibility that the failure of an employee to claim privilege on behalf of the corporation would result in waiver or loss of the privilege (except perhaps where the employee is authorised to waive the privilege). To the contrary, it is precisely if a general duty to claim the privilege is imposed that a risk of waiver arises - that is, imagine that an employee under a duty was given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of the employer but failed to do so; under Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 that would be conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege and would mean that any employee, without the knowledge or authority of the corporate employer, could waive the corporation's privilege. For those reasons, it does not seem either necessary or wise to impose a general obligation on an examinee to claim privilege on behalf of a third party, nor to create a general obligation on behalf of the examiner to give the examinee a reasonable opportunity to make such a claim. While an employee may have an obligation in contract or equity to maintain the confidences of his or her employer ( NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley (2001) 80 SASR 151 at [16]-[19]), that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer's legal professional privilege. 37 But while there may be a question as to what obligations or abilities a person may have in respect of claims of privilege on behalf of third parties, it is clear that there is no requirement in the ASIC Act , which imposes an obligation on ASIC to afford a person or entity (other than the person the subject of the exercise of the compulsory power) (ie the third party itself): 1. an opportunity to intervene or interject in the exercise of the compulsory power over another in order to claim or assert legal professional privilege on behalf of itself: see, in particular Pts 3 and 7 of the ASIC Act ; or 2. notice that the exercise of its compulsory power in relation to another individual (such as an examinee) may result in that individual providing information that is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege by that third party. See by way of example, May v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 287 ; (1999) 92 FCR 152 at [31] , [36] and [38] and MM at [36] and [37]. 38 That is not surprising. If ASIC were under an obligation to notify a third party that the exercise of its compulsory power in relation to another individual (such as an examinee) may result in that individual providing information that is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege by that third party, by what criteria would ASIC determine when and in what circumstances it was required to notify a third party? Would ASIC be required to interrupt an examination upon becoming aware of the prospect of or the fact of information being provided by an examinee which might be the subject of a claim of privilege by a third party? How would ASIC determine if it was properly subject to a claim for legal professional privilege? The list of difficulties is endless and the possibility great that efficient and timely investigation of wrongdoing would be frustrated. 39 Moreover, there are measures that the third party can take to prevent disclosure of its privileged information even in the absence of a right to intervene. First, where an examinee is subject to the exercise of compulsory powers by a government authority and in possession of privileged information where the holder of the privilege is a third party, it is open to the holder of privilege to require or authorise the examinee to assert the holder's privilege to the authority: MM at [33] (cf s 122(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)). Of course, the efficacy of this strategy is likely to be limited in situations where the third party does not have prior notice of the examination or other exercise of power over another under the ASIC Act . 40 Secondly, equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained , especially where the information is used as a ""springboard for a claim or defence in litigation"": Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 at [15] - [17] . As Emmett J noted in MM , there is nothing to prevent the holder of a claim for privilege making a privilege claim prior to the tendering of evidence against the holder of any information obtained by ASIC in circumstances not giving rise to a waiver: eg ss 76 - 83 of the ASIC Act ; ss 118 and 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 3 All ER 816. Put another way, ""the right of the holder of the privilege not to have privileged material used in evidence against him or her [or it]"" is not affected by the disclosure of the privileged material by a party within the scope of the privilege but not entitled to control its exercise: MM at [38]. This is a natural consequence of the basic principle that only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Moreover, although not applicable in the present case (because the third party here is a corporation, which has no privilege against self-incrimination: Daniels at [31]), that preservation of privilege extends not only to legal professional privilege but also privilege against self-incrimination because the ASIC Act abrogates privilege against self-incrimination (s 68(1)) and then provides a ""use immunity"" to the examinee in relation to information obtained in a s 19 examination where the requirements of s 68(2) are satisfied: s 68(3) of the ASIC Act . Interestingly, unlike other Commonwealth legislation, the ""use immunity"" in the ASIC Act only applies to persons in relation to the making of an oral statement or the signing of a record and not to the production of documents: s 76(1)(d) of the ASIC Act ; see also Privilege in Perspective , ALRC Report No 107 (2007) at Ch 7 and in particular, paras [7.65] [7.69] and [7.103] and [7.104]. 42 It is well established that ""an administrative decision may be impugned if the decision maker was bound to take a factor into account in reaching his or her decision but failed to do so"": MM at [40]. If a statute states expressly the factors that must be taken into account that will be decisive. However, if the relevant factors are not expressly stated, they must be determined by necessary implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24 , 39-40; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 , 347-348."
Case889,cited,Onefone Australia Pty Ltd v One.Tel Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1188,"Section 127(1) of the ASIC Act imposes an obligation on ASIC to take all reasonable measures to protect the unauthorised use or disclosure of information given to it in confidence in performance of its functions: Onefone Australia Pty Ltd v One.Tel Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1188 at [7] . Section 127(4) provides an exception to that general principle. Where ASIC is satisfied ""particular information"" will assist, for example, the AFP, then disclosure of that ""particular information"" to the AFP will be taken to be an authorised use and disclosure of that ""particular information"". 19 The exercise of the power under s 127(4) of the ASIC Act is the exercise of an additional power in relation to the ""particular information"" identified by ASIC at the time of the request by the AFP. It necessarily will involve consideration of ""information"" that did not exist at the time of the examination (here, the questions and answers recorded in the transcript) or the taking of the witness statement (here, the statement). It will also necessarily involve the consideration of matters that did not exist at the aforementioned times, including the nature of the agency function or power (here, criminal investigation by the AFP) and the usefulness of the information to that exercise of power (here, the conduct of that investigation). Section 127(4A) of the ASIC Act provides that ASIC may impose conditions in relation to disclosure of the ""particular information"" under s 127(4). The conditions imposed by ASIC in respect of the AWB Information are those set out in [7] above. 20 In the present case, the dispositive issue (see [13] above) has two aspects to it. The two aspects to consider are: 1. whether, in exercising the power under s 127(4) , by deciding to pass the AWB Information to the AFP, ASIC failed to consider a relevant matter; and 2. a more basic question of power. For reasons which will become obvious, it is first necessary to deal with the question of power. 21 There is no factual foundation yet established that there is material in the AWB Information to which the legal professional privilege of AWB attaches. However, if the AWB Information does contain information to which the legal professional privilege of AWB attaches, ASIC would have power to pass on that material to the AFP. That conclusion requires development."

Case891,considered,Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 153 CLR 134,"If, however, ASIC meant to submit not that it could compel a person (here, an employee or former employee) to disclose a third party's (here, a company's) privilege by force of statute, but rather that the person may lack the standing to assert the third party's privilege, then that contention may be accepted. Just as an employee can only waive a corporation's privilege if he or she has authority to do so (typically, where the person is a current officer or director), so too may an employee only assert a claim of privilege belonging to a corporation if he or she has the requisite authority: Commodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub [1985] USSC 102 ; 471 US 343 , 348-49 (1985); In re Grand Jury Proceedings [2006] USCA1 234 ; 469 F3d 24 (1 st Cir 2006); Wrench LLC v Taco Bell Corporation 212 FRD 514 , 517 (WD Mich 2002) (collecting cases); see also S McNicol, Law of Privilege (1992) at 161-62 (citing Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 153 CLR 134 for the proposition that an employee cannot assert the privilege of self-incrimination on behalf of a corporation [at that time corporations were still thought to have such a privilege] because the privilege is personal to the holder). To put it another way, the ASIC investigator was legally correct when he told counsel for AWB that ""[n]either ... could [the employees] make the claim [of privilege on behalf of AWB] nor [could they] waive the claim..."": [12] above. 30 That conclusion sounds, at least at first blush, as harsh or unjust. Even Mason J, in holding that an employee could not claim privilege against self-incrimination on behalf of his or her corporate employer in order to resist a subpoena, accepted that ( Rochfort at 145): To acknowledge that the employee's possession [of privileged information] is sufficient in itself to sustain an obligation to produce, without reference to his employer, would be to disregard the employer's rights with respect to his documents. What is more it would deprive him of the privilege of objecting to produce a document on the ground that it has a tendency to incriminate him. However, closer examination reveals both why this result is not as harsh as it first seems and why it is necessary. 31 First, although the examination under s 19 of the ASIC Act is private, it is an examination where ""the inspector may give directions about who may be present during it, or during a part of it"": s 22(1). If a direction is made for a person to attend, that person is entitled to attend the examination: s 22(2). The ""person"" referred to in s 22 is not the examinee's lawyer. The right of the examinee's lawyer to attend and address the inspector is separately and expressly provided for in s 23. Who then could that person be? One obvious contender is the legal adviser of the examinee's employer in circumstances such as those outlined in the extracts of the transcript (see [10] above). But ASIC did not permit that to occur. The power to make directions must include directions not only about the identity of the legal representative who might be entitled to attend on behalf of the company at any examination, but also about the non-disclosure of the contents of the examination to any person or entity (including the entity seeking to protect its privileged communications). 32 Of course, there cannot be a general rule that a legal representative of the employer or the former employer of the examinee should be permitted to attend to protect the employer's privilege. There may well be circumstances where to do so would jeopardise the investigation: see eg Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at [35] , [38]; see also Rochfort at 145 (Mason J) (stating that request for the production of privileged information should generally be directed to the employer but ""the protection of the employer's interests [in the information] must give way to the public interest in the efficient administration of justice in case of collision between the two""). But in the absence of such a circumstance, the voluntary grant by ASIC of a limited right to be present in the manner outlined by counsel for AWB might have forestalled the issues raised in these proceedings. 36 I should also note that examinees were even given an opportunity to raise an issue as to a possible third-party privilege. No doubt this is the best policy, but whether it was required as a matter of law may be doubted: see Rochfort at 145-47 (noting that in general effort should be made to respect potential interests of the third-party lawyer but that there are various circumstances where the interests of justice will trump protection of those interests).

Case894,cited,SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162,"On 19 April 2004, I gave directions in the proceeding, including a direction that the applicant file and serve any amended application, with proper particulars of the grounds relied upon. I also granted a certificate pursuant to O 80 of the Federal Court Rules , so that the applicant could receive legal advice from a barrister. Counsel who ultimately appeared for the applicant accepted the referral. An amended draft order nisi was filed, in which prohibition was sought against the Minister, and certiorari and mandamus against the Tribunal, although the Tribunal was still not named as a respondent to the proceeding. Remedies cannot be sought against the Tribunal unless it is named as a respondent, so it will be necessary for me to make orders adding the Tribunal as a respondent, with consequential amendments to the documents filed. See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162 . 6 By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Migration Act '), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied that Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms 'Refugees Convention' and 'Refugees Protocol' are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967. It is convenient to call these two instruments, taken together, the 'Convention'. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who: 'owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country'. 7 Section 91R of the Migration Act provides relevantly as follows: '(1) For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person, Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol does not apply in relation to persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned in that Article unless: ... (b) the persecution involves serious harm to the person; and ... (2) Without limiting what is serious harm for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the following are instances of serious harm for the purposes of that paragraph: (a) a threat to the person's life or liberty; (b) significant physical harassment of the person; (c) significant physical ill-treatment of the person; (d) significant economic hardship that threatens the person's capacity to subsist; (e) denial of access to basic services, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist; (f) denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist.'"
Case895,followed,Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641,"Counsel for the Minister argued that, at least as to part of the relief claimed, the application was out of time under the High Court Rules 1952 ('the High Court rules') and, unless the Court extended the time, that relief could not be granted. As I have said, the relief sought against the Minister is prohibition. The High Court Rules contained no time limit in respect of an application for prohibition. Counsel for the Minister contended that it was inappropriate to seek prohibition against the Minister; once the Tribunal decision has been made, if it is not set aside, the Minister has a statutory obligation to remove the applicant from Australia. While this argument may be correct, it is of no consequence in the present case. It is conceded that, as against the Tribunal, the remedy of certiorari was sought by the filing of the application in the High Court within the time limit then fixed by O 55 r 17(1) of the High Court Rules. The application to the High Court was not filed within the two-month time limit, fixed by O 55 r 30 of the High Court Rules, in respect of an application for mandamus. In Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641 at [73] , after examining some of the authorities, I expressed the conclusion that the better view is that, once the High Court has remitted an application for an order nisi to this Court, the time limits applicable in that court are no longer of any consequence. I remain of that opinion. 22 In any event, there was an amended draft order nisi filed in this Court. Although the use of an amended draft order nisi was perhaps not the most convenient procedure, it was of itself sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, conferred by s 39B of the Judiciary Act , afresh. On the assumption that the Tribunal's decision is affected by jurisdictional error, and is consequently not 'a decision...made...under this Act' for the purposes of the definition of 'privative clause decision' in s 474(2) of the Migration Act , the time limit then fixed by s 477(1) was inapplicable. On that assumption, there was no time limit fixed for invoking the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s 39B of the Judiciary Act , in respect of the Tribunal's decision. See Applicants M16 at [74]. 23 If it were necessary to enlarge the time limit for the application for mandamus, to give the applicant a constitutional entitlement to seek certiorari as an adjunct to mandamus (certiorari being a remedy not mentioned in s 75(v) of the Constitution ), then I should not hesitate to do so in the present case. There has been no undue delay. The proceeding was commenced within the time limited for an application for certiorari. The delay is not, in any event, gross. The Minister has not claimed to have suffered any prejudice by reason of the delay. The applicant's claim is one that has merits. 24 An alternative view is that certiorari might be a remedy available to the applicant, pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), in a proceeding in which the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked validly by the remittal by the High Court of the application for prohibition against the Minister, even if the applicant could not succeed in obtaining that remedy against that respondent. 25 For all these reasons, it is unnecessary to consider the issue of the time of the commencement of the proceeding any further. 26 The applicant's case included a number of facts which, if accepted, distinguished him from most, if not all, of the people dealt with by the Egyptian authorities as a result of the activities at the nightclub. At the time of the events, the applicant was not a teenager, but was in his mid-twenties. He was not merely attending the events at which what were regarded as satanic rituals were taking place, but was facilitating those events, by making videotapes, and ensuring that the memory of the events was kept alive, by selling the videotapes to the participants. It was perhaps true to say, as the Tribunal did, that he was not an 'organiser' of the events, but he was certainly not in the same category as the ordinary participants."
Case896,distinguished,Award Simplification Case (1997) 75 IR 272,"Counsel also argued that I should look at the earlier award in 1965 which was ""simplified"": see Award Simplification Case (1997) 75 IR 272.

Case903,cited,St George Bank v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147,"The relevant principles in relation to preliminary discovery were summarised by Hely J in St George Bank v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at [153]-[154]. These indicate that O 15A r 6 is to be beneficially construed and given the fullest scope that its language will reasonably allow, with the proper brake on any excesses lying in the discretion of the Court in the light of the specific circumstances. Each of the elements in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of r 6 must be established. The test for determining whether the applicant has ""reasonable cause to believe"" as required by r 6(a) is an objective one. There is no requirement for the applicant to make out a prima facie case, but a mere assertion that there may be a right to obtain relief is not sufficient. There must be more than suspicion or conjecture. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application in so far as it is based on that cause of action. 15 In relation to r 6(b), the authorities indicate that the question is whether an applicant has sufficient information for the limited purpose of making a decision as to whether to commence proceedings in the Court. It is permissible for an applicant to obtain discovery to determine what defences are available to the respondent, and the possible strength of these defences, but discovery is not available to an applicant so that it may exhaust every possible line of defence. The question as to whether sufficient information is available requires an objective assessment to be made."

No doubt inspection of the documents referred to in Alphapharm's application would assist it in taking that decision, but I am of the view that it already has reasonably sufficient information to enable it to decide. Another way of expressing the matter is to say that Alphapharm has not, after making all reasonable inquiries, come up against an obstacle consisting of the lack of key information which it reasonably needs to enable it to decide whether to commence a proceeding; rather, it hopes to be comforted in taking the decision which it already has sufficient information to enable it to take .'

Case906,cited,C7 Pty Limited v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864,"These remarks, particularly at [50], are apposite to the present case. It is necessary for an applicant to show more than a mere assertion that there is a case against a prospective respondent: see C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 at [39] . The purpose of preliminary discovery is not to produce material which will strengthen or enhance a decision to commence proceedings but rather to provide what is reasonably necessary to enable the decision to be made. 20 The respondents resist the application and submit that the application must fail because essential elements which must be established under r 6(a) to (c) in order to found jurisdiction in the Federal Court have not been made out. In addition, the respondents submit that as a matter of discretion, the Court should refuse to grant the discovery sought on the basis that it is oppressive and so broadly cast as to encompass what are likely to be a substantial number of irrelevant documents. 21 In relation to r 6(a), the respondents submit that, objectively approached, there is no reasonable cause to believe that the applicant may have a right to obtain relief in the Federal Court. This is because the elements of the prospective cause of action advanced by the applicants which might attract federal jurisdiction, namely, a claim for misleading and deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), are not present on the evidence. It is said that as an objective conclusion, it has not been established that the elements of such an action can be made out. For present purposes the respondents do not dispute that there may be a cause of action in contract, but say this is not sufficient to ground jurisdiction for the grant of preliminary discovery because it lacks the necessary federal element to satisfy r 6(a) so that there is a right to relief in the Federal Court. Unless there is reasonable cause to believe there is a federal cause of action, it is said that the preliminary discovery application must be refused for want of jurisdiction."

Case910,referred to,Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589,"The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court, SZFMW v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1274 , in which Driver FM dismissed his application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') handed down on 11 December 2003 ('the Tribunal decision') on the basis of Anshun estoppel. The Federal Magistrate's orders were interlocutory (rule 44.12(2) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth)). The applicant therefore requires leave to appeal to this Court (ss 24(1)(d) and 24 (1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)). The first respondent opposes the application on the basis that Driver FM's judgment is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant leave to appeal being granted and no substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted. 6 His Honour said that, while the issue was not raised in the earlier court proceedings, the principle of res judicata would still probably apply and that, even if it did not, there was no reason why the issue could not have been raised in the earlier legal proceedings. His Honour said that the applicant was simply seeking to take advantage of a recent Court decision that appeared to favour an argument that could have been raised previously. In his Honour's view, the circumstances gave rise to an estoppel in accordance with the principles in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 and Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 51 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10. His Honour said at [5]: ' Applicants cannot continue to agitate concluded litigation when new court decisions are made that appear to be to their advantage ' and dismissed the application. 11 The applicant, who appears in person assisted by an interpreter, was unable to point to any error in Driver FM's decision to dismiss the application on the basis of Anshun estoppel. He reiterates the difficulties with his previous legal representatives and relies upon his lack of appreciation of what could have been advanced before Smith FM. 12 There is no evidence of whether the applicant or his legal advisers were or were not aware of the possibility of reliance upon s 441G of the Act at any time prior to the decision of SZIZO . Even if that section could apply in the present case, a later change to the law does not affect the fact that no jurisdictional error was found in the Tribunal's decision. In Wong the Full Court of the Federal Court applied Anshun in the context of judicial review of administrative action. The Full Court stated at [37] that: In essence, where the issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time, it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceeding between the parties."

He points out that s 441A(4)(c)(ii) of the Act provides that the Tribunal may give a document to a person by posting it to the last residential or business address provided by the recipient in connection with the review. The Minister says that the postal address disclosed in correspondence satisfies the requirements of that section. On that basis no breach of s 441G of the Act could be made out as the Tribunal sent the correspondence to the authorised recipient at the postal address disclosed in correspondence between the authorised recipient and the Tribunal in respect of the review of the applicant's application."

His Honour noted at [5] that the Court documents disclosed: ... an arguable case in that, while the Tribunal appears to have corresponded with the applicant's authorised recipient at the postal address of the authorised recipient disclosed in correspondence, the Tribunal has apparently not corresponded with the authorised recipient at the office address stipulated in section C of the review application completed by the applicant. 12 There is no evidence of whether the applicant or his legal advisers were or were not aware of the possibility of reliance upon s 441G of the Act at any time prior to the decision of SZIZO .

Case915,applied,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190,"In SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at 1196, para 18, in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ, the following passage appears: if the reason why the tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting ""information"" within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 424A (1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the Appellant's evidence failed to disclose a convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute ""information."" Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 that: The word ""information"" does not encompass the tribunal's objective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identify gaps, defects or lack or detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc. 9 And then the High Court continued: If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons, but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly ""information"" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. 10 There is both an evidentiary as well as a legal characterisation question involved in an allegation that s 424A has been breached. For present purposes, the evidentiary element is resolved against the Appellant in the sense that it is patent that the Tribunal sent to him a letter dated 3 August 2007, which at least purported to comply with the obligation the Tribunal apprehended it had under s 424A. When one examines the terms of that letter as a matter of legal characterisation, it is apparent that the Tribunal has complied with, and perhaps even exceeded, the obligations which fell on it pursuant to s 424A , having regard to what was said by the High Court in SZBYR . 11 The Tribunal has, at some length in the letter, highlighted particular inconsistencies, which it apprehended, having regard to statements made by the Appellant, either to the Department or in evidence at the hearing the Tribunal conducted. Having so done, the Tribunal, in its letter of 3 August 2007, stated that: The inconsistent statements are relevant to the review, as they indicate that you may not be a truthful witness, and that you may have not told the truth in the information provided to, and the statements made to, the Department and to the Tribunal in support of your protection visa application. 12 The Tribunal then, in its letter, invited the Appellant to give comments in writing on the information it had set out in the letter. The Appellant did not respond to this invitation. The learned Federal Magistrate concluded that in the circumstances, there had been no breach by the Tribunal of s 424A. His Honour noted that, at para 83 of the Tribunal's reasons, the Tribunal had come to a conclusion that the Appellant was not a truthful witness. His Honour made reference (at para 15) to a portion of the Full Court's reasons for judgment in VAF , quoted by the High Court in SZBYR , a passage I have already cited. I respectfully agree with the learned Federal Magistrate that no breach of s 424A is evident."
Case916,cited,NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264,"When asked to elaborate upon this ground in oral submissions, the Appellant replied, ""no comment"". Again though, out of considerations of fairness and humanity, it seems to me that with an appellant whose primary language is not English and for whom these processes must seem quite strange, it seems to be preferable to consider this ground on its merits, rather than to treat it in light of the oral submission made as having been abandoned. One finds in the Federal Magistrate's decision at para 17 what in my respectful opinion is an apt summary of principle pertinent to this ground of appeal as given by Moore, Tamberlin and Allsop JJ in NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 at para 115: By and large fact finding is a task within jurisdiction, though factual error is not necessarily mutually exclusive of jurisdictional error Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ex parte Applicant S20 of 2002 198 ALR 9 where fact finding has been conducted in a manner which can be described as here as in substantial respects unreasoned and mere assertion lacking rational or reasoned foundation at times is plainly and ex facie wrong and is selective of material going one way. These conclusions may found a conclusion that the posited fair-minded observer might or indeed would, reasonably apprehend that the conclusions had been reached with a mind not open to persuasion and unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly. How else the fair-minded observer might ask can one explain the largely unreasoned rejection of documents as vague when they plainly were not and it's not saying the appellants were Catholics when expressly or impliedly they did. And how else does one explain not dealing with answers which revealed an apparently detailed knowledge of the Christian religion and the Christian faith when a conclusion is drawn that persons are not Christian based on weighing some answers to questions of less than central importance. The answers to these questions might be that the tribunal lacked an appreciation of the need to weigh all the material. If that were the case, it would itself support a conclusion of jurisdictional error. The answer might also be the lack of an ability or willingness to deal with the material before it with a mind open to persuasion barely evaluating all the material. 14 One sees in the Tribunal's reasons a very comprehensive rehearsal indeed of the basis upon which the Appellant sought a protection visa and of the various statements which he had made both to the department and later to the Tribunal. Having so done, under the heading ""Findings and Reasons"", one finds in the Tribunal's reasons what seems to me, as it seemed to the Federal Magistrate, a logical and reasoned analysis of the ramifications of particular inconsistencies there detailed by the Tribunal. That analysis culminates in the following paragraphs in the Tribunal's reasons which capture not only the bases of the Appellant's claim for a protection visa but also why the Tribunal concludes that the claim lacks a factual foundation: [83] On the above evidence and for the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that the applicant is not a truthful witness and his statements, both to the Department and the Tribunal, lack credibility. Also for the above reasons, and as the Tribunal has found that the applicant is not credible, the Tribunal also finds that the applicant: was not a member of an underground church, was not involved with Mr Lin in religious activities, was not involved with a Mr Lin, who was or was claimed to be Taiwanese spy by Chinese authorities, did not provide ""waste paper"" with government stamps to Mr Lin, was not warned by Chinese authorities to not go to bible study meetings, was not advised by Chinese authorities to attend ""big church"", was not arrested in August 2006, his shop was not searched and closed by police at the end of October 2006, and he did not go into hiding at the end of 2006. 15 Having made these findings, the Tribunal then found: [84] Although the applicant has knowledge of Christianity and may be a Christian, the Tribunal finds that he would not be persecuted in the reasonable foreseeable future if he returns to the Peoples Republic of China for his religious or imputed religious beliefs, as the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant is a member of an underground church. Further, for similar reasons, the Tribunal finds that the applicant would not be persecuted in the reasonably foreseeable future if he returned to the Peoples Republic of China, his opinion or imputed political opinion, as the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant was involved with Mr Lin, who was or was claimed to be a Taiwanese spy by Chinese authorities or he provided ""waste paper"" with government stamps to Mr Lin. 18 In SZKLK v Minister For Immigration [2008] FCA 1125 , I had occasion to review various authorities touching upon the administrative law error ground of bias. I shall not repeat what is there stated. One way in which a claim for bias might be made out, in a way which intersects with unreasonableness, is that stated in the passage which I have quoted from in NADH of 2001 . That basis is not made out here. The conclusions reached by the Tribunal are objectively able to be seen as referable to logical consequences of credibility findings reasonably open to the Tribunal. There is not a scintilla of evidence which would support a conclusion of actual bias on the part of the Tribunal. However one approaches the case, the result is nothing more than a consequence of conclusions the Tribunal reached in light of inconsistencies that it found. That result is undoubtedly disappointing to the Appellant, but again, I remind myself that it is no part of my role to descend into the merits of whether the claim should be accepted. There is no error, in my opinion, in the Federal Magistrates rejection of ground 3."
Case917,cited,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405,"The findings which the Tribunal made were reasonably open to the Tribunal. It is not the role of the Federal Magistrates Court, and much less is it the role of this Court, to make value judgments as to the factual merits of a claim for a protection visa, or in respect of the credibility of the applicant for such a visa. A principled restraint is called for on the part of those exercising judicial power in relation to such matters in these types of cases. Credibility findings are, in the ordinary course, findings of fact par excellence: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405. 17 Again, it is evident from the Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment that his Honour adopted just such an approach. Further, like his Honour, I do not apprehend from the Tribunal's reasons any error on its part in applying the so-called ""real chance"" test. In this regard, it suffices for me to endorse, respectfully, the observations made by the learned Federal Magistrate at para 20 of his reasons for judgment. On the findings which the Tribunal made, it was quite reasonably open to conclude that the Appellant did not face a real chance of persecution were he to be returned to the Peoples Republic of China."

Case919,cited,SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 ; (2008) 247 ALR 451,"Though this was not advanced as a ground of appeal, the Minister very properly drew my attention to a recent decision of a Full Court, SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 ; (2008) 247 ALR 451 , which had considered the meaning and application of s 91R. In that case, the Full Court construed s 91R(3) as capable of sensible application, only once primary findings of fact have been made. In other words, conduct must first be shown to have taken place before it could be disregarded. It is evident from the passage which I have quoted from the Tribunal's reasons that conduct, namely attendance at church in Australia, was found. The Tribunal was entitled to make the finding that it did concerning the motivation for that attendance. 21 Further, the Tribunal was obliged, having made its findings, to disregard the attendance, and whatever ramifications it may have had in relation to a claim for a protection visa, in light of s 91R(3). The Tribunal's reasons do not disclose any error of the kind highlighted in SZJGV . 22 For these reasons then, the appeal must be dismissed.

Case920,affirmed,Nathan v Capital Finance Australian Ltd [2007] FMCA 1503,"appellant, Mr Kailai Nathan, appeals from a judgment of Burchardt FM, in which his Honour dismissed Mr Nathan's claims concerning alleged contraventions of ss 52 and 60 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (""the Act ""); see Nathan v Capital Finance Australia Ltd [2007] FMCA 1503. Mr Nathan's amended statement of claim in the proceeding below traversed many issues, however his Honour struck out all aspects of it other than those concerning ss 52 and 60 of the Act . In his reasons for judgment, Burchardt FM said at [10]: ""I did ... make it clear that the trial would be restricted to the issues involving alleged contraventions of s 52 and s 60 of the Act ."" The aspects of the amended statement of claim dealing with other issues were the subject of interlocutory decisions of the primary judge in respect of which Mr Nathan did not seek leave to appeal. The events the subject of the claim under s 52 of the Act occurred in May 2001. Mr Nathan's case was essentially as follows: &#8226; on 24 May 2001 he visited the premises of James Lane Motors in Coburg; &#8226; at that time he was employed as a casual psychiatric nurse by a nursing agency; &#8226; he spoke to a Mr Gavin Fernandez at James Lane Motors about purchasing a motor vehicle; &#8226; on 28 May 2001, he returned to James Lane Motors and spoke to a Mr Cameron McCredie; and &#8226; Mr McCredie told him that the loan arrangement for the purchase of the vehicle included ""loan protection cover"" for the monthly payments. The respondent's case on the s 52 issue was essentially as follows: &#8226; Mr Nathan might be confused about loan protection insurance on the car because he had taken out a personal loan with the respondent in September 2001 which included a sickness, accidental injury or involuntary unemployment insurance policy, as part of that personal loan; &#8226; no such loan protection cover was included in the car loan or any representation made to that effect; &#8226; it is not possible to obtain such insurance cover in favour of a debtor; and &#8226; if such a representation was made by Mr McCredie, he was not authorised to do so by the respondent."
Case922,applied,Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118,"findings of fact, referred to above, on the s 52 issue were strong and decisive ones, aided by the primary judge's observations of the evidence given by Mr Nathan and by Mr McCredie. Grounds one, three and seven of the notice of appeal dealing with the s 52 issue challenge certain findings of fact made by the primary judge. Those findings include his Honour's categorisation of Mr Nathan as an unimpressive witness with a propensity not to tell the truth. Those are not matters on which this Court is any better placed than the court below to assess, nor is a review of the factual findings the Federal Magistrate made a proper exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court; see Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 125-126 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The only substantive legal challenge to the s 52 aspect of the case as dealt with below is the allegation in ground two of the notice of appeal that Mr Nathan was denied natural justice by his Honour's alleged failure to give proper effect to s 52. That ground is related to ground eight which alleges that the primary judge failed to consider whether the alleged representation induced Mr Nathan into error. Those grounds are untenable. Section 52 precludes a corporation, in trade or commerce, from engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. His Honour found that no such conduct occurred. That finding was open to him on the evidence before him. No appealable error has been identified on this aspect of the appeal. Ground five of the notice of appeal contains the allegation that the primary judge erred in his approach to the allegations of harassment and coercion made under s 60 of the Act . Section 60 of the Act provides: A corporation shall not use physical force or undue harassment or coercion in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer . On the topic of the alleged breach of s 60 by the respondent, the primary judge said at [69]: It only remains now to deal with the issue of harassment asserted by Mr Nathan. The endeavours made by the Respondent to repossess the car and to otherwise pursue legal avenues against Mr Nathan were all, in my view, entirely reasonable and do not begin to approach what might be said to be harassment within the meaning of s 60 of the Act ."
Case923,considered,O'Sullivan v Parkin [2007] FCAFC 98,"the primary judge published his reasons for judgment on 10 September 2007 he did not make any orders. The current appeal was, to that extent, premature; see O'Sullivan v Parkin [2007] FCAFC 98. No orders were made until 18 September 2007 when his Honour dismissed the application and ordered costs against Mr Nathan on an indemnity basis. Mr Nathan has not sought to appeal from the judgment which contained the operative orders in respect of which he seeks relief. However, despite this, I have dealt with his appeal as if the judgment of 10 September 2007 contained an order dismissing his application. This is the most practical commonsense way of dealing with the controversy between the parties, especially as Mr Nathan does not have the benefit of legal representation. It is also necessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal enumerated in Mr Nathan's notice of appeal. Ground four contains a new allegation of bias against the primary judge and has not been substantiated by Mr Nathan. The allegation concerned a disclosure made by his Honour of a shareholding in the parent company of the respondent. Mr Nathan conceded that he did not raise any issue of bias at the time his Honour made the disclosure and therefore acquiesced in his Honour hearing the application. However, Mr Nathan referred in his oral submissions today to comments made in transcript by the Federal Magistrate at an interlocutory hearing. Those comments showed that the Federal Magistrate was keen to bring the proceeding to finality. That does not mean that he was biased in any way against Mr Nathan or that there exists any basis for a reasonable apprehension of bias against his Honour. Ground six is: ""Did the learned Federal Magistrate err in law in assuming the terms of the Loan Protection insurance in the absence of the policy itself..."". This ground is based on an incorrect premise that the primary judge assumed the terms of an agreement when it was proved that no such agreement existed. That ground also fails. The Court will order as follows: 1. The appeal is dismissed. 2. The appellant pay the respondent's costs of the appeal. I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.

Case924,discussed,Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510,"Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said (544-545 [83]-[85]): ""As Guo makes clear, even if the Tribunal is not affirmatively satisfied that the events deposed to by an applicant have occurred, the degree of probability of their occurrence or non-occurrence is a relevant matter in determining whether an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution. The Tribunal ""must take into account the chance that the applicant was so [persecuted] when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of future persecution"" . However, given the nature of the prosecutor's claim, the Tribunal was entitled &#8212; indeed bound &#8212; to start its inquiry by considering her claim that she had been arrested by government officials for political reasons. ... Once the Tribunal was unable to find that she had been arrested as claimed, her further claims of detention and rape became logically irrelevant. The Tribunal, having found that it could not rely on her evidence of arrest, was not then required to act on her allegations of detention and rape, allegations which were dependent on her claim of being arrested and taken into custody for reasons of political opinion. The Tribunal was not bound therefore to make any express finding as to whether she had been raped. Nor given the nature of her claim and the Tribunal's finding that she was not a credible witness was it required, as it might have been in other circumstances, to determine whether there was a real chance that she had been arrested as she claimed.""

Case925,referred to,Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353,"the appellant submitted that the Tribunal's result was so unreasonable that the Tribunal must have proceeded under a misconception which amounted to jurisdictional error.

Case926,cited,AZAAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Another [2008] FMCA 1533,"is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: AZAAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Another [2008] FMCA 1533. On 14 November 2008, that Court made an order that the appellant's application for constitutional writs directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") be dismissed. The appellant is a national of Egypt. He arrived in Australia on a student visa on 10 May 2005, having left Cairo on 9 May 2005. On 23 June 2005, the appellant made an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa (""protection visa""). On 30 September 2005, a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused the appellant's application for a protection visa. On 2 November 2005, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision. On 28 January 2006, the Tribunal decided to affirm the delegate's decision not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. The appellant made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court for constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal. By consent, the Federal Magistrates Court issued constitutional writs setting aside the Tribunal's decision and it remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be determined according to law. On 5 February 2008, the Tribunal (differently constituted) once again decided to affirm the decision of the delegate not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. The appellant again made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court seeking constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal and it is the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court on that application which is the subject of the appeal to this Court."
Case927,followed,Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389,"appellant submits that the approach of the Tribunal member involved jurisdictional error and that the federal magistrate erred in law in failing to so conclude. He referred to the well-known passage in the joint reasons for judgment of Gummow and Callinan JJ in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 ("" Dranichnikov "") (at 394 [26]): ""At the outset it should be pointed out that the task of the tribunal involves a number of steps. First the tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention. That determination in part at least involves a question of law. If that question is answered affirmatively, the next question, one of fact, is whether the applicant is a member of that class. There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear, whether the fear is well-founded, and if it is, whether it is for a Convention reason."" The appellant submits that the Tribunal member failed to determine at the outset whether the following particular social groups, or one of them, existed for the purposes of the Convention: (a) a family of Coptic Christians with prominent members that proselytise Muslims in Egypt; and (b) Coptic Christian proselytisers of Muslims in Egypt. The Tribunal member rejected the suggestion that merely being a Coptic Christian could give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution and, as I understand it, it is not suggested that jurisdictional error arose in relation to that conclusion. The Tribunal member reached the same conclusion after he added to the appellant's status as a Coptic Christian the activities of his grandfather and uncle. The Tribunal member also rejected the appellant's account of his proselytising activities. As the Tribunal member said, he rejected ""various constituent details of [the appellant's] account"" and he was not satisfied that the appellant faced or faces significant relevant harm from Muslim fundamentalists in his community. As far as the two particular social groups set out in [45] above and on the assumption in relation to the group identified in (a) that the appellant is one of the prominent proselytisers, the Tribunal member approached the matter by going straight to the second question, namely, whether the appellant was a proselytiser of Muslims. He found that he was not. In those circumstances, it was not necessary for the Tribunal member to formulate and consider a precise social group because an element of each formulation is that the appellant was a proselytiser of Muslims. The Tribunal member did make a reference to whether proselytisers of Muslims in local Christian communities could face persecution by reason of those activities, but he did not directly address the first question identified by Gummow and Callinan JJ in Dranichnikov . Nevertheless, for the reasons I have given, that did not lead to jurisdictional error. It is not clear to me whether the appellant is submitting that the Tribunal member failed to address, as an alternative to his principal claim, a claim that he feared persecution not as a result of his own activities, but as a result of his membership of his family and the activities of his grandfather and uncle. If he is making that submission, I would reject it because I think the Tribunal did address that possibility. The appellant's own claim that his problems did not begin until 2003-2004 meant either that his family was not a relevant particular social group or, in the circumstances, membership of it did not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. The second ground of appeal is linked to the first. It is that the federal magistrate erred in not concluding that the Tribunal member erred by addressing the wrong question in that the Tribunal member concluded that the appellant had not been drawn into the conflict involving his uncle and that he was not significantly affected by his grandfather's situation or his uncle's situation. I do not think the Tribunal member erred in approaching the matter in that way. He was saying no more than that the appellant's membership of his family, which included his grandfather and uncle, did not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. That was a finding open to the Tribunal member on the evidence."
Case928,discussed,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559,"""what if I am wrong test"" was discussed by Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 576. ""It is true that, in determining whether there is a real chance that an event will occur or will occur for a particular reason, the degree of probability that similar events have or have not occurred or have or have not occurred for particular reasons in the past is relevant in determining the chance that the event or the reason will occur in the future. If, for example, a Tribunal finds that it is only slightly more probable than not that an applicant has not been punished for a Convention reason, it must take into account the chance that the applicant was so punished when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of future persecution. In the present case, however, the Tribunal appears to have had no real doubt that its findings both as to the past and the future were correct. That is, the Tribunal appears to have taken the view that the probability of error in its findings was insignificant. Once the Tribunal reached that conclusion, a finding that nevertheless Mr Guo had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason would have been irrational. Given its apparent confidence in its conclusions, the Tribunal was not then bound to consider whether its findings might be wrong."" In Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said (544-545 [83]-[85]): ""As Guo makes clear, even if the Tribunal is not affirmatively satisfied that the events deposed to by an applicant have occurred, the degree of probability of their occurrence or non-occurrence is a relevant matter in determining whether an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution. The Tribunal ""must take into account the chance that the applicant was so [persecuted] when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of future persecution"" . However, given the nature of the prosecutor's claim, the Tribunal was entitled &#8212; indeed bound &#8212; to start its inquiry by considering her claim that she had been arrested by government officials for political reasons. ... Once the Tribunal was unable to find that she had been arrested as claimed, her further claims of detention and rape became logically irrelevant.

Case929,referred to,N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 21,"refer also to N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 21 at 34-35 [43]-[49]. In my opinion, there are two answers to the appellant's submission. The first is that the Tribunal member did not, it seems to me, have any real doubt about his conclusions. He found that, even making allowance for the appellant's medical condition, he was not a witness of truth. He made the point on a number of occasions in the course of his reasons that he did not believe the appellant's account of events and that he found particular claims made by the appellant to be inconsistent and implausible. The second answer to the appellant's submission is that the Tribunal member did address the ultimate questions of whether the appellant faced or faces significant relevant harm from Muslim fundamentalists in his community and whether he faced a real chance of persecution in Egypt (see [19] and [22]). The second submission in relation to grounds three and four is that it is said that the Tribunal member's reasoning in the following passage is illogical: ""The Tribunal accepts as genuine the death certificate pertaining to the Applicant's father. The Tribunal accepts that the Applicant's father died at home at 49 years from a 'brain haemorrhage' or stroke. The Tribunal is prepared to accept in principle that a person could die hours after a serious beating from internal bleeding, for example, in the head or in the torso. On the evidence before it, the Tribunal does not accept the claim that the Applicant's father died as a result of police brutality or that he was detained and mistreated by the police shortly before dying. On the evidence before the Tribunal, the claimed circumstances of the Applicant's father's death are concocted. This is to a significant extent because the Tribunal does not accept as factual the key events that led to the Applicant going into internal exile, or the circumstances in which he returned to the farm, or the facts about how he obtained his passport. The Tribunal does not accept the Applicant's claim that the authorities adopted a stance or pattern of detaining and beating his father to get to or at him, the Applicant, or to extract information about him. The Tribunal also finds that in view of the Applicant's overall credibility problems up to this point, it does not accept that the authorities, supposedly acting in the interests of violently angered fundamentalists, adopted a stance or pattern of detaining and beating the Applicant's father to punish him for his own actions or to deter him from similar actions in the future."""
Case930,discussed,NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264,"connection with this submission, reference was made to NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 ("" NADH "") and, in particular, to Allsop J (with whom Moore and Tamberlin JJ agreed) at 286-287 [129]-[136]. I do not think that there is anything illogical in the Tribunal member's reasoning. In essence, the conclusion is reached that the story is concocted by the appellant because key elements of his account cannot be accepted. The fifth ground of appeal is not pressed by the appellant. Secondly, the appellant submitted that the conduct of the review and the findings made by the Tribunal member should lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal was guilty of apprehended bias. The appellant referred to NADH at 266-285 [10]-[125], a case in which the Full Court of this Court held that the Tribunal was guilty of apprehended bias. A singular feature of that case was that a number of letters and documents were in effect put to one side by the Tribunal member as not establishing any fact without any real reasons being given for adopting that course. For example, a number of letters were dismissed by the Tribunal member as being of no weight on the grounds that they were vague or did not establish certain matters without any real reasons being given for those conclusions."
Case931,discussed,NAQS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1137 ; (2003) 77 ALD 424,"the appellant submitted that the conduct of the review and the findings made by the Tribunal member should lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal did not conduct the review required by the Act. The appellant referred to NAQS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1137 ; (2003) 77 ALD 424 , a case in which Hill J reached the conclusion that the Tribunal had not conducted the review required by the Act. Without being exhaustive, features of that case which led to that conclusion were a refusal by the Tribunal member to allow the applicant to call a witness, the Tribunal member acting in a rude manner and the Tribunal member cutting the applicant off in the course of his answers and refusing to hear explanations from the applicant."
Case932,referred to,The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100,"the appellant submitted that the Tribunal's result was so unreasonable that the Tribunal must have proceeded under a misconception which amounted to jurisdictional error. The appellant referred to Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360 per Dixon J and The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 120 per Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ."
Case933,cited,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273,"Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 ( Teoh ), the High Court held (McHugh J dissenting) that procedural fairness required that if a relevant decision maker proposed to make a decision inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention, procedural fairness required the decision maker to inform the person affected and provide to that person the opportunity of presenting a case against the taking of such a course. The reason was that ratification by Australia of an international convention engendered a ""legitimate expectation"" that administrative decision makers would act in conformity with that convention. Mr Karp has drawn attention to the fact that the expression has perhaps fallen into disuse since Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 , see especially at [61]-[64] and [81]-[83] per McHugh and Gummow JJ, [121] per Hayne J, [148] per Callinan J. In view of the way in which the present case was argued, I need say no more of this. Quite apart from Teoh , the Direction provided a basis for a legitimate expectation that the Minister would treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration when deciding whether to cancel Mr Rinka's visa. This expectation was created by the fact that the letter of 20 February 2006 notifying Mr Rinka of the Minister's intention to consider cancelling his visa stated that the decision-maker would have regard to the Direction in coming to a decision. I will first address the question whether the best interests of Mr Rinka's children were in fact treated as a primary consideration by the Minister. Briefing Paper The briefing paper to the Minister, headed ""Issues for Consideration of Possible Cancellation of a Visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 "", was structured by reference to the Direction. Since it was plain that Mr Rinka failed to pass the character test, there was little discussion of that matter. The Minister's ""Discretion"" was considered under the headings ""Primary Considerations"", ""Other Considerations"" and ""Other International Obligations"". Three Primary Considerations were discussed: ""Protection of the Australian Community"", ""The Expectations of the Australian Community"" and ""The Best Interests of the Child""."

Case935,distinguished,Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 ; (2001) 107 FCR 133,"Rinka submits that the Minister failed to identify what the best interests of the children indicated she should decide with respect to the cancellation of Mr Rinka's visa, and that the Minister therefore did not treat the best interests of the children as a primary consideration in reaching her decision. In making these submission, Mr Rinka relies on Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 ; (2001) 107 FCR 133 ( Wan ) (see, particularly, [26]-[27], [31]). Mr Rinka submits that the concept of the best interests of the children involved consideration of their relationship with Mr Rinka. He submits that the Minister had before her the older son's letter saying that he misses his father and speaking of his exploits at soccer, yet she did not refer to this material in her statement of reasons. Counsel for Mr Rinka accepts that this alone does not show jurisdictional error, but submits that, in combination with the ""speculative"" comments made by the Minister in para 81 of her statement of reasons, it does suggest that she did not give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the material that was before her. If she did not, it would follow that the best interests of the children also could not have been given proper, genuine and realistic consideration. Consideration Wan , on which Mr Rinka relied, concerned an appeal to the Court from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) affirming a decision of the Minister to refuse to grant a permanent residence (general-spouse) visa on character grounds. It was also a ""best interests of the child"" case. There were provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) governing the procedure of the AAT that have no relevance in the circumstances of the present case. Nonetheless, the Full Court's holding in Wan that in order to treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration, a decision maker must identify what those interests indicate the decision should be, is applicable. The Full Court held that the AAT did not do so. An alternative ground for the Full Court's decision was that the conclusion was inescapable that the AAT had not treated the best interests of the child as ""a primary consideration"". As indicated earlier, although the Minister's statement of reasons does not say in terms that ""the best interests"" of Mr Rinka's children dictated that his visa not be cancelled, that is the effect of para 83. Moreover, the Minister did say that she was treating the best interests of Mr Rinka's children as a primary consideration, and it is not shown that her statement to that effect should not be accepted. In the result, in my opinion the Minister's statement of reasons shows that the Minister treated the best interests of Mr Rinka's two children as a primary consideration, as she said she did in the first sentence of para 80."
Case936,cited,Lamb v Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 201,"On 26 February 2007 I made orders in the following terms: 1. The applicant is to file and serve a substituted statement of claim on or before 26 March 2007. 2. The respondents are at liberty to provide to the applicant on or before 12 March 2007 information by way of letter or disclosure of documents or by an affidavit sworn by their solicitor upon instructions, setting out: (i) their respective functions as members of the Hog's Breath group of companies in Australia; (ii) their respective roles in the use of the Hog's Breath Works as defined in the statement of claim and/or the registered trade marks referred to in the statement of claim; (iii) the ways in which the Hog's Breath Works and/or the registered trade marks have been used by them in respect of the classes of goods and services to which they relate. I also made orders relating to the costs of the respondents' strike out motion and adjourned the directions hearing to 11 April 2007: Lamb v Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 201. 4 In argument prior to the delivery of that judgment counsel for Mr Lamb said that he did not have a clear picture of the respective functions of the respondent companies within the Hog's Breath group. In the original statement of claim it was said that HB Investments Pty Limited (HB Investments) held registered trade marks and that the principal case against it was that it had authorised infringement of Mr Lamb's copyright in the Wave Hog Work by licensing to the other corporate respondents the right to use those trade marks. What trade marks were licensed to which respondents did not appear. A significant obstacle in the way of a more precise pleading on Mr Lamb's part was the absence of information about which of the companies took that role within the Hog's Breath group and which was responsible for the production and marketing of the various articles said to bear infringing productions of the work or of a substantial part thereof. As noted in that judgment want of knowledge does not of itself excuse a pleading which does not identify which cause of action is raised against which respondent or which fails to identify the material facts constituting each such cause of action. Although O 15A of the Federal Court Rules may well have been available to enable Mr Lamb to identify the persons against which he might have a cause of action, or the causes of action he might have, it was not availed of. 5 A substituted statement of claim was filed on 10 April 2007. It was a much more substantial document than its predecessor and was settled by senior counsel. It identifies Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (Hog's Breath Company) as the master franchisor, since 24 October 2006, of a franchised chain of restaurants around the world known as ""Hog's Breath Cafes"". A list of Australian franchisees is scheduled to the statement of claim. Hog's Breath Cafe (Australia) Pty Ltd (Hog's Breath Cafe (Australia)), the second respondent, is identified as the master franchisee of the Australian franchisees since at least 24 October 2006. HB Investments is said to be the registered owner of Australian registered trade mark numbers 701388 and 1013512, both of which involve the image described, inter alia, as ""Hog, cartoon wears sunglasses &amp; crossed bandages, adhesive on body"". Hog's Breath Clothing Co Pty Ltd (Hog's Breath Clothing) is said to be the owner and operator of a business selling merchandise under the name ""Hog's Breath Clothing"" through a website and through the Australian franchisees. The fifth respondent, Mr Algie, is said to be a director, secretary and majority shareholder of Hog's Breath Company and to have been a director of Hog's Breath Cafe (Australia) between September 1995 and April 2000. He is also said to be a director, secretary and majority shareholder of HB Investments and a director, secretary and majority shareholder of Hog's Breath Clothing. 6 Paragraphs 7 to 12 assert subsistence and ownership of copyright in the Wave Hog Work by Mr Lamb. Paragraphs 13 and 14 plead and particularise Mr Algie's access and exposure to the Wave Hog Work and his knowledge that the respondents are not, and have not, been the owners of copyright in that work. It is alleged that the work depicted in Schedule B to the application is a reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the Wave Hog Work ([15]). Paragraphs 16 to 21 deal with the conduct of the Australian franchisees asserting, inter alia, that they have displayed the infringing work on restaurant signage and on banners and have distributed or offered for sale or exhibited to the public various items depicting that work. These items are set out in a schedule to the substituted statement of claim. 7 The substituted statement of claim then sets out the bases of Mr Lamb's copyright claim against Hog's Breath Company ([22]-[38]), Hog's Breath Cafe (Australia) ([39]-[54] inclusive), HB Investments ([55]-[66] inclusive), Hog's Breath Clothing ([67]-[83] inclusive) and Mr Algie ([84]-[103] inclusive). There are allegations of a common design entered into by the various respondents ([104]) and pleading of facts relied upon to support a claim for additional damages under s 115(4) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) and conversion damages under s 116(1) of that Act ([105]-[106]). Moral rights claims are also raised against the respondents ([107]-[175]). The substituted statement of claim concludes with allegations that the registration by HB Investments of the Australian registered trade marks was and remains unlawful."

Case941,cited,Bourke v State Bank of New South Wales (1988) 22 FCR 378,"Bourke v State Bank of New South Wales (1988) 22 FCR 378 (at 394), Wilcox J held that the expression "" the interests of justice "" in s 5(4) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 (Cth) ought to be read widely. His Honour referred to the need to consider all aspects of a matter including both substantive and adjectival matters and concluded by saying: It is not in ""the interests of justice"" to adopt a course, in relation to those matters, which places unnecessary burdens and delays upon the parties to the litigation. These ideas, although not directly applicable, are nevertheless apt to be applied in the present case. In summary, it seems to me, there is in reality no connection at all with New South Wales. There is nothing else which can fairly be weighed in the balance in favour of keeping the proceedings in this Registry of this Court. There are, on the other side of things, substantial reasons based upon the cost and inconvenience to individual litigants which would justify a transfer to the Queensland District Registry of this Court and I propose to make an order accordingly. It seems to me that the applicant was entitled to resist the application in the form in which it was pressed because the primary order sought was an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of Queensland. The third respondent has not persuaded me that such an order should be made. On the other hand, the applicant did resist the making of any orders. In those circumstances each of the relevant parties has experienced some success and some failure. It seems to me that the appropriate order as to the costs of the motion for transfer brought by the third respondent is that those costs be costs in the proceedings."

The Court went on to say (19 FCR at 162): Ultimately the test is: where can the case be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all the parties, the ends of justice in the determination of the issues between them, and the most efficient administration of the Court. It cannot and should not, in our opinion, be defined more closely or precisely. Other sources of the power to transfer a proceeding to another Registry of this Court are O 10 r 1(2)(f) and O 30 r 6 of the Federal Court Rules . The relevant guiding principles are the same under the Rules as under s 48 of the Act."
Case944,cited,Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550,"seems to me that the approach of the High Court in Miah, and indeed in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550, which was applied in Miah , makes this all too plain a case of a breach of the rules of procedural fairness.

Case945,referred to,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57,"fundamental objection, however, was that the point had no merit and would not succeed. In my view, the point does have merit, and in the very unusual circumstances of this case, it seems to me that an amendment should be permitted along the lines read onto the record by the solicitor for the appellants. The argument has merit based upon the decision of the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57, where in very similar circumstances, (that is, a change of position in the country of origin prior to the decision due to reliance by the delegate on new material and the appellant being given no opportunity to respond), the High Court had no difficulty in finding that there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. The main issue in that case was that by then there had been amendments to the Act which enabled an argument to be put that there was then a code for dealing with the situation and that the ordinary common law natural justice rules did not apply. That argument is not available in this case, because the amendments had not been made, so the common law rules clearly do apply. The answer which is made on behalf of the Minister is that in this case, all the issues raised in the later material to which reference was made by the Tribunal member were traversed in the earlier material and that the late material really amounted to pieces of evidence which were not required to be put forward for particular comment. There is also, I might say, always the argument that it is the visa applicant's case, and if circumstances change in the country of origin, then it is up to the applicant to keep on top of things and keep the Tribunal informed. It seems to me that the approach of the High Court in Miah, and indeed in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550, which was applied in Miah , makes this all too plain a case of a breach of the rules of procedural fairness.

Case946,followed,Re Magna Alloys and Research Pty Ltd (1975) 1 ACLR 203,"The question for the court was succinctly stated by Bowen, CJ in Eq in Re Magna Alloys and Research Pty Ltd (1975) 1 ACLR 203 at 205. His Honour noted that an applicant who came seeking relief bore an onus of establishing that the general policy of the legislature laid down in an analogue of section 206B ought be made the subject of an exception in his or case. His Honour continued: 'The court in exercising its discretion will have regard to the nature of the offence of which the applicant has been convicted, the nature of his involvement and the general character of the applicant including his conduct in the intervening period since he was removed from the board and from management. Where, as here, the applicant seeks leave to become a director and to take part in the management of particular companies the court will consider the structure of those companies, the nature of their businesses and the interests of their shareholders, creditors and employees. One matter to be considered will be the assessment of any risks to those persons or to the public which may appear to be involved in the applicants assuming positions on the board or in management' 10 In this case, the two offences I have described appeared to me, as they did to both the applicant and the Chief Judge of the District Court, to differ in character. The offence involving the false statement about the company not being a party to any legal proceedings is one which, in its true context, does not appear to me to involve any serious issue of lack of probity or anything other than a clear and wrong, but, in all the circumstances, unfortunate slip by the applicant in filling in and signing a form on advice. 11 The other conviction, which was the one that attracted the more serious penalty, is of a different order and involved an attempt, on one view, to avoid paying a substantial sum of money due to the State by making a false statement that there were no outstanding liabilities. I have considered the evidence on this matter and the applicant's attitude that he has now clearly set out to resolve this issue and to pay what is due to the State Authorities subject to, what seems to me to be not unreasonable, trying to find from the State Authorities any offsetting amounts that might be due back to Aluform. The evidence before me shows that Mr Lahood has made some considerable efforts to ascertain from the relevant New South Wales Authorities the amount of registration moneys which ought be refunded but has not even received the courtesy of a reply to any of his attempts to find this information out. Hopefully that situation will remedy itself in the period allowed in the proposed orders. 12 I have formed the view that the applicant is genuinely contrite and remorseful for the errors which he committed and recognises that what he did was wrong. It seems to me to be a lapse in an otherwise clean and good record. The applicant has managed these companies with his family for over 20 years. The transport industry is one which is notoriously difficult in economic terms and yet the evidence shows that the companies in the Transtar Group have over 70 employees and also engage something in the order of about 10 contractors. They appear to be otherwise well managed. There are no matters which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('the Commission'), which intervened in the proceedings, was able to bring to attention as to the business practices of the applicant or the Transtar Group which might give any rise to concerns that there was a risk to the public or to those in the companies from the applicant being allowed to be a director, once again, as he seeks. 13 At the conclusion of the oral evidence I inquired of counsel for the Commission whether it was the Commission's position that the disqualification should remain and that there be no leave granted. Counsel, on instructions, said that that was not the Commission's position and that the Commission considered that appropriate conditions could be imposed."
Case947,referred to,Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Comalco Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 510,"The discussion by the High Court in Thompson v Australian Capital Television [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 186 CLR 574 of subordinate dissemination is of particular interest (see Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 585 590, Gaudron J at 591 596 and Gummow J at 617 620). That case concerned the liability of a television station that took to air a direct ""feed"" of a live current affairs show from another television station. The argument that it was a mere conduit failed. Emphasis was placed upon the choice made by that station to take a live current affairs program likely, to be controversial, directly to air without any editing or scrutiny. For an earlier, brave but unsuccessful, attempt to argue that a television station which puts a debate to air is not responsible for statements by participants see Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Comalco Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 510."

The principal claims were based on infringement of copyright by a website that facilitated the free downloading of certain sound recordings. The first respondent was the registered owner and operator of the website. It contained hyperlinks to thousands of sound recordings which were located on remote websites and downloaded directly from those websites to the computer of the Internet user. The music file was not sent to, downloaded on, transmitted through or saved to the first respondent's website. The second to fifth respondents hosted the website and were responsible for maintaining the connection to the Internet. They were unaware of the contents of the website and took no steps to inform themselves of that content. Tamberlin J held that the first respondent infringed copyright by authorising the infringing acts of Internet users who accessed the website and the owners or operators of the remote website from which the infringing recordings were downloaded. He permitted and approved the infringements and had sufficient control over his website to prevent the infringements (150 FCR 1 at [77] [102]). The second to fifth respondents infringed the copyright by authorising the infringing acts (150 FCR 1 at [103] [132]). They had an active role in relation to the website, were aware of the content of the website and had the power to prevent the infringing acts.

In that case, the defendants carried on business as an Internet Service Provider and received and stored on their news server an article, defamatory of the plaintiff, which had been posted by an unknown person using another service provider. The plaintiff informed the defendants that the article was defamatory and asked them to remove it from their news server. They failed to do so and it remained available for some 10 days until its automatic expiry. It was held that the defendants were liable at common law as the publisher of the posting they were not merely the passive owner of an electronic device through which postings were transmitted but actively chose to receive and store the news group exchanges containing the posting which could be accessed by their subscribers and could have chosen to obliterate the posting complained of, as they later did. The critical portion of the judgment was as follows ([2001] QB at 208 209): ""In my judgment the defendants, whenever they transmit and whenever there is transmitted from the storage of their news server a defamatory posting, publish that posting to any subscriber to their ISP who accesses the newsgroup containing that posting. Thus every time one of the defendants' customers accesses soc.culture.thai and sees that posting defamatory of the plaintiff there is a publication to that customer. The situation is analogous to that of the bookseller who sells a book defamatory of the plaintiff: see Weldon v 'The Times' Book Co. Ltd (1911) 28 TLR 143 (the case about the books on Gounod); to that of the circulating library who provided books to subscribers: see Vizetelly v Mudie's Select Library Ltd [1900] 2 QB 170 (the case about the book on Stanley's search for Emin Pasha in Africa: see in particular the judgment of Romer LJ pages 178 181); and to that of distributors: see Bottomley v FW Woolworth &amp; Co Ltd (1932) 48 TLR 521 (the case about the article in Detective Story Magazine headed 'Swindlers and Scoundrels. Horatio Bottomley, Editor and Embezzler') and Sun Life Assurance Co of Canada v WH Smith &amp; Son Ltd (1933) 150 LT 211 (the case about newspaper posters announcing 'More grave Sun Life of Canada disclosures'). I do not accept Mr Barca's argument that the defendants were merely owners of an electronic device through which postings were transmitted. The defendants chose to store soc.culture.thai postings within their computers. Such postings could be accessed on that newsgroup. The defendants could obliterate and indeed did so about a fortnight after receipt."" 29 In Kaplan v Go Daddy Group [2005] NSWSC 636 White J, in an interlocutory decision, speaking of comments disparaging of a business posted on a website said (at [32] [33]): ""There is also a serious question to be tried that he was the author of the other headings and comments on the site to which I have referred.

Godfrey [2001] QB 201 was distinguished. 32 The ability to prevent publication or the continuance of publication in the context of defamation as applied in Godfrey [2001] QB 201was based in part upon Byrne v Deane [1937] 1 KB 818. That case concerned liability of a golf club for a defamatory note on the golf club notice board. That principle, as it applied in defamation, was analysed with some care by Hunt J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Urbanchich v Drummoyne Municipal Council (1991) Aust Torts Reports 81-127. It was concluded that it was necessary for the plaintiff to establish that the defendant had, in fact, accepted responsibility for continued publication by consenting to, approving of, adopting or promoting or in some way ratifying the continued publication. Such accepted responsibility could be established by inference. That case involved someone else's defamatory statement being attached to the defendant's property.

That case concerned the liability of a television station that took to air a direct ""feed"" of a live current affairs show from another television station.

The principal claims were based on infringement of copyright by a website that facilitated the free downloading of certain sound recordings. The first respondent was the registered owner and operator of the website. It contained hyperlinks to thousands of sound recordings which were located on remote websites and downloaded directly from those websites to the computer of the Internet user. The music file was not sent to, downloaded on, transmitted through or saved to the first respondent's website. The second to fifth respondents hosted the website and were responsible for maintaining the connection to the Internet. They were unaware of the contents of the website and took no steps to inform themselves of that content. Tamberlin J held that the first respondent infringed copyright by authorising the infringing acts of Internet users who accessed the website and the owners or operators of the remote website from which the infringing recordings were downloaded. He permitted and approved the infringements and had sufficient control over his website to prevent the infringements (150 FCR 1 at [77] [102]). The second to fifth respondents infringed the copyright by authorising the infringing acts (150 FCR 1 at [103] [132]). They had an active role in relation to the website, were aware of the content of the website and had the power to prevent the infringing acts. Those findings were substantially upheld on appeal, although an employee of the Internet service provider was let out ( Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 ; (2006) 156 FCR 380 particularly per Branson J at [28] [52], [61] [65] and Kenny J at [136] [165])."

Considerations relevant when deciding whether leave to appeal should be granted are: whether in all the circumstances the judgment of the primary judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court; and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision were wrong. In the present proceeding it is not considered that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attendant with sufficient doubt to warrant leave being granted. Nor is it considered that the Applicant would suffer substantial injustice. His application for a protection visa has been considered on its merits by both a delegate of the Minister and by the Tribunal. His application filed with the Federal Magistrates Court has been carefully considered and no legal error discerned. No injustice is exposed in such circumstances. The Federal Magistrate, in his reasons for decision, recounted the facts relevant to the Applicant's claim for a protection visa. Those reasons record that "" [n]o supporting evidence "" for the claims being advanced by the Applicant was provided to the Department and also record the rejection of the claim. Those reasons further record that the Applicant was subsequently invited to attend a hearing before the Refugee Review Tribunal but that he declined that invitation. Express reference is made by the Federal Magistrate to some of the findings made by that Tribunal. Albeit not set forth expressly in his reason for decision, it is relevant to note that the Tribunal further stated: [36] The applicant did not attend the Tribunal hearing. The applicant only made the briefest of claims. The applicant claims he belongs to a minority group in Pakistan, the 'Mohanjir' community who are Muslims by religion. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to accept that he belongs to the 'Mohanjir' community. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to be satisfied that he and his family have been persecuted by the majority community in Pakistan for several years. ... [37] I am required to consider the situation if the applicant, a Pakistani citizen from Sialkot, were to return to Pakistan now or within a reasonably foreseeable future. ... But the independent evidence before me ... does not suggest that the applicant would not receive the protection of the Pakistani authorities or that such protection would be ineffective, if the applicant were to be harmed. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to be satisfied that if he returns to Pakistan he will be killed, harmed or persecuted for a Convention related reason. The mere fact that a person claims fear of persecution for a particular reason does not establish either the genuineness of the asserted fear or that it is ""well-founded"" or that it is for the reason claimed. [38] I do not accept there is a real chance the applicant will suffer harm now or in the foreseeable future if he were to return to Pakistan and I am not satisfied the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention related reason. Given the paucity of the material submitted in support of his claim and the paucity of the material apparently available to the Tribunal, and the decision of the now Applicant not to accept the invitation extended to him to attend a hearing before the Tribunal, these conclusions were perhaps not unexpected. The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate then outline the manner in which he approached his task. The Federal Magistrate observed that "" the applicant's original application made unparticularised contentions of ' gross violations of the Regulations and the Act '..."". An amended application was apparently filed from which the Federal Magistrate discerned "" four essential points ""."

McHugh J said, at 480: [Order 60 rule 6] provides that a court or a justice may enlarge the time appointed by the Rules for doing an act upon such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require and that the enlargement may be ordered although the application is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or fixed for doing the act. The grant of an extension of time under this rule is not automatic. The object of the rule is to ensure that those Rules which fix times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice. The discretion to extend time is given for the sole purpose of enabling the court or justice to do justice between the parties: see Hughes v National Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co of Australasia Ltd [1978] VR 257 at 262. This means that the discretion can only be exercised in favour of an applicant upon proof that strict compliance with the rules will work an injustice upon the applicant. [40] There are two relevant matters concerning whether the Court should exercise its discretion to extend time. The first is whether a sufficient explanation for the delay has been forthcoming; the second is whether the proposed appeal would enjoy any prospect of success, such that it ought be allowed to proceed.

Case974,considered,SZNFR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 408,"before the Court is an Application for Leave to Appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: SZNFR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 408. That Application seeks both leave to appeal and "" an order that compliance with Order 52, subrule 5(2) be dispensed with "". Leave to appeal is required because the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application before that Court pursuant to Rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth). Rule 44.12 provides as follow: Show cause hearing (1) At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause, the Court may: (a) if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed &#8212; dismiss the application; or (b) if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed &#8212; adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court; or (c) without making an order under paragraph (b), make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application. (2) To avoid doubt, a dismissal under paragraph (1) (a) is interlocutory. The dismissal of an application pursuant to Rule 44.12(1)(a) is, accordingly, an interlocutory decision and s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the 1976 Act) imposes the requirement to obtain leave before any appeal may be entertained. In addition, and as the Application itself recognises, the Application as filed in this Court was filed outside the time prescribed by O 52 r 5(2) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). Rule 5 provides as follows: Time for filing application (1) This rule applies only to applications where an appeal from the judgment lies to the Court only with leave. (2) An application shall be filed within 21 days after: (a) the judgment was pronounced; or (b) a later date fixed for that purpose by the court or judge who pronounced the decision. (3) Where an application is not filed within the time limited by subrule (2), an order shall be sought in the application that compliance with subrule (2) be dispensed with."
Case975,cited,Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1,"material before this Court includes the respondent's statement of facts and contentions before the Tribunal. This document at [27] advanced the contention that 'Great Bamboo Pty Ltd was not an eligible business because it was not a business in the necessary sense' . In support of this contention it made reference to Mason J's consideration in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 of the meaning of 'business' in a phrase such as 'carrying on a business' . There his Honour stated that in the context of the rating provisions of the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW) the phrase 'carrying on a business' denoted activities 'engaged in for the purpose of profit on a continuous and repetitive basis' (at 8-9). The respondent's statement of facts and contentions before the Tribunal argued that Mr Koosasi's business did not appear 'to have been carried out on an ongoing or repetitive basis' . At [28] the same document advanced the alternative contention that Great Bamboo was not an eligible business because it did not meet any of the requirements listed in the definition of 'eligible business' in s 134(10). In support of this contention the document made reference to the absence of evidence that Mr Koosasi had developed business links with the international market. It also noted that Great Bamboo had not created and was unlikely to create employment, that it had not introduced new or improved technology into Australia nor had it increased commercial activity or competitiveness in the Australian economy. At [39] of its written reasons for decision the Tribunal conflated the two submissions of the respondent identified above, noting: 'The respondent also submits that the business is not an ""eligible"" business as it has only completed four export transactions since its registration in January 2003 and such limited number could not be considered continuing or repetitive ... there is no evidence the company has developed links with international markets; and the company has not created employment; exports of wheat, flour and juice has not introduced any new or improved technology to Australia.'

Case976,referred to,AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234,"18 September 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment in this proceeding and adjourned the matter to Monday 25 September 2006 for any argument as to the orders that should be made to give effect to my reasons: AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [251] . These reasons for decision are directed to the final orders that I have determined to make, having heard submissions from the applicant and the respondents yesterday. The issues that separated the parties narrowed considerably during the course of yesterday's hearing. The remaining differences relate to the form of declaratory relief that is appropriate and the costs orders that should be made. AWB submitted that, where I have determined that documents attract privilege, wholly or partly, the Court should make a declaration to that effect. On the other hand, AWB submitted that, where I have determined that documents over which AWB claimed privilege do not attract privilege or that any privilege has been waived, I should not make a declaration to that effect. It submitted that any such declaration was unnecessary and would lack utility. Senior Counsel for AWB said, from the bar table, that the documents in question were being produced to the Commission. The relevance of this is dubious, as it follows the delivery of my reasons for judgment and, presumably, anticipates that final orders will be made that give effect to those reasons. AWB also pointed out that the Commonwealth had not mounted any cross-claim for declaratory relief in its favour."
Case977,followed,Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 ,"making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the Court's discretion: Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-439 per Gibbs J; and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 ( 'Ainsworth' ) at 581-582 and 596-597. As a matter of substance, the dispute that AWB submitted to the Court for its adjudication was whether legal professional privilege did, or did not, attach to the documents in AWB's further revised list of privileged documents dated 7 August 2006 (as supplemented by letters from AWB's solicitors to the Court dated 25 August 2006 and 5 September 2006). In my opinion, any declarations made by the Court should reflect the final outcome of this case with certainty and precision. Moreover, it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court."
Case978,followed,Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564,"making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the Court's discretion: Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-439 per Gibbs J; and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 ( 'Ainsworth' ) at 581-582 and 596-597.

In my opinion, any declarations made by the Court should reflect the final outcome of this case with certainty and precision. Moreover, it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court. I have concluded that the Court should make a declaration, reflecting my reasons for judgment, that legal professional privilege attaches to specified documents, and does not attach to other specified documents. Declaratory relief in this form is appropriate because it determines the legal controversy that was before the Court: see Ainsworth at 582 and 596-597; and Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 at 355-356. As AWB's application makes clear, the controversy includes the question whether the documents at issue are protected from production to the Commission by legal professional privilege. This controversy is only likely to be quelled, completely and finally, by making a declaration in the form I propose."

Case980,considered,Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4,"submitted that the circumstances do not warrant any departure from the usual approach that an applicant who achieves substantial success should have the costs of the proceedings. AWB relied in particular on the following passage from Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 ( 'Cretazzo' ) where Jacobs J said at 16: 'But trials occur daily in which the party, who in the end is wholly or substantially successful, nevertheless fails along the way on particular issues of fact or law. The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues, however doubtful, which might be material to the decision of the case. There are, of course, many factors affecting the exercise of the discretion as to costs in each case, including in particular, the severability of the issues, and no two cases are alike. I wish merely to lend no encouragement to any suggestion that a party against whom the judgment goes ought nevertheless to anticipate a favourable exercise of the judicial discretion as to costs in respect of issues upon which he may have succeeded, based merely on his success in those particular issues.' In short, AWB submitted that it achieved substantial success and that it should have the costs of the proceeding, notwithstanding its failure on the issues of waiver and the fraud exception. The Commonwealth submitted that AWB should pay its costs of the proceedings. It argued that success in this case cannot be measured purely in numerical terms; rather a judgement ought to be made as to which party has had substantial success in the case, having regard to the significance of the issues decided by the Court in favour of one or other party. It added that a finding that privilege subsists in a large number of technical or peripheral documents cannot be weighed in the same scale. The Court's discretion to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is unfettered, except that it must be exercised judicially. The usual order as to costs is that a successful party will have its costs paid on a party and party basis by the unsuccessful party: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234. As the passage from Cretazzo indicates, the mere fact that a substantially successful applicant fails on particular issues of fact or law along the way may not afford an adequate ground for depriving that applicant of some or all of its costs. On the other hand, it lies within the Court's discretion to make a costs order that reflects the degree of success attained: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234-235 [11] and 236 [15].

Case988,cited,Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261,"many cases, these principles can only be applied sensibly by taking a broad view of the results of the case and the issues that were litigated. An allocation of costs in a case of mixed results can rarely if ever be done with mathematical precision: Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261 at 272 per Gummow, French and Hill JJ. Taking a broad and overall view of the outcome of this case, I consider that both AWB and the Commonwealth achieved a substantial measure of success. I cannot agree with AWB's submission that, in material respects, it was the successful litigant. The Commonwealth succeeded on a number of very important issues. It established that privilege did not attach to numerous documents that are likely to be material to the issues being investigated by the Commission. AWB did not merely fail 'along the way' to prove particular issues of fact and law which, in the end, did not prevent it achieving substantial success; rather, AWB lost some of the most substantial issues that were litigated. Those issues involved more than half of the hearing time occupied by this case. In all the circumstances, I consider that the just and appropriate order is that there be no order as to the costs of the proceeding. The result will be that AWB and the Commonwealth must each bear its own costs. I do not consider that there is any substance in the criticisms that AWB directed towards the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was entitled to put AWB to the proof of its privilege claims. Nor do I agree with AWB's assertion that the description of the documents in AWB's lists was generally sufficient to enable the Commonwealth to form a view about the provenance of each document and the grounds upon which privilege was claimed. AWB also sought the costs of its notice of motion dated 19 June 2006 and the first respondent's notice of motion dated 24 July 2006. I have concluded that there should be no order as to the costs of these notices of motion."

Case993,cited,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129,"addition to the question of construction of the relevant provision of the Act, his Honour also turned to some of the affidavit material and the facts reflected in those affidavits. At [10] of the primary judge's reasons in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129 on 12 February 2009, the primary judge said this: The evidence lead on behalf of Neo Rock on the application is noteworthy for its absence of reference to the overall financial position of that company. There is no evidence which touches upon the assets and liabilities of the company generally, its profit and loss, its balance sheet, or its solvency, either having regard to the debt as it presently stands (which has its origins in that which supported the statutory demand) or otherwise howsoever. The focus of the affidavit material which has been read is on dealings as between Neo Rock and the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO) in the context of an as yet unresolved audit of that company's taxation affairs by the ATO. The primary judge noted that the company had engaged a chartered accountant, Mr Vicca, to assist the company with the task of bringing its business activity statements up to date. Mr Vicca expressed certain opinions about the balance debt due to the Deputy Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner in response filed affidavit material which suggested that the present indebtedness of the company to the Deputy Commissioner and therefore payable as a debt due to the Commonwealth was $24,132.01. The company contests aspects of that assertion and did so before the primary judge. The primary judge also noted at [13] that the company had failed to lodge income tax returns for the financial years ending 30 June 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The primary judge concluded at [14]: It is not a satisfactory state of affairs for a company, faced with an application for its winding up in respect of a debt which it has not contested in the way provided for when a statutory demand was issued, to seek an indefinite adjournment of a winding up application on the strength of what is, in substance, an assertion unfocussed on the subject of proof of the solvency of the company."

Case997,followed,Autodesk Inc. and Another v Dyason and Others (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300,"considering the substance of the applicant's claims, it is to be observed that ordinarily the Court cannot revisit its findings. In Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council and Others [1982] HCA 41 ; (1982) 149 CLR 672 at 684 Mason ACJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:- ...the circumstances in which this Court will reopen a judgment which it has pronounced are extremely rare. The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution. Generally speaking, it will not be exercised unless the applicant can show that by accident without fault on his part he has not been heard. Similarly, Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc. and Another v Dyason and Others (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 303 said that the power of the Court to reconsider judgments would not be exercised for the purpose of ' re-agitating arguments already considered by the Court ', nor ' because the party seeking a rehearing has failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might have been put '. While such authority refers to a basis for reviewing an earlier decision where the Court, still possessing jurisdiction in a proceeding, later considers its decision to be erroneous, this Court considers that the principle referred to in Autodesk and McMullin applies generally and should guide this Court in the present circumstances. Is forfeiture dependent upon conviction or commission of a criminal offence?"
Case998,referred to,Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427,"applicant relies upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Dimella Constructions Pty. Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215 in which the Court at 221-222 considered the meaning of the word 'contravention'. Additionally, the applicant submits that the principle of interpretation that Parliament is not taken to deprive persons of property rights without expressing its intention in unmistakable and unambiguous terms applies: see Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437-438. The applicant also relied upon the rule of construction that dispossession of a valuable property right without compensation cannot be imputed to Parliament unless expressed in unequivocal terms incapable of any other meaning: see Coco v R at 437-438. The applicant submits that the word 'contravention' used in s 261A of the Migration Act should be construed narrowly and confined, in accordance with the Second Reading speech of the Act inserting s 261A into the Migration Act , to those cases where forfeiture of the vessel occurs as a penalty in relation to 'people smuggling' criminal offences and not in respect of those instances where persons seek asylum."
Case999,referred to,Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Air Canada [1991] 2 QB 446,"answer to the applicant's submissions lie the words used in s 261A of the Migration Act . The words providing for the forfeiture are clear and unequivocal. The principles relied upon by the Commonwealth concerning forfeiture of property are not in contest, and the concept is clearly recognised: see for example Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Air Canada [1991] 2 QB 446. In that decision the Court upheld the validity of a forfeiture of an aircraft which was involved in the carriage of cannabis resin, even though the owners of the aircraft were unaware of that fact. Whilst the law providing for forfeiture may appear harsh, that is the necessary consequence of its operation regarding property rights. In the present circumstances forfeiture occurred when the vessel was used or involved in a ' contravention of this Act '. Such contravention occurred by the bringing in or coming into Australia of one or more persons who were or became unlawful non-citizens, contrary to s 42 of the Migration Act . The text of s 261A of the Migration Act is unambiguous. In these circumstances the authorities relied upon by the applicant have no scope for application. The Refugee Convention"
Case1000,applied,Dimella Constructions Pty. Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215,"applicant relies upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Dimella Constructions Pty. Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215 in which the Court at 221-222 considered the meaning of the word 'contravention'. Additionally, the applicant submits that the principle of interpretation that Parliament is not taken to deprive persons of property rights without expressing its intention in unmistakable and unambiguous terms applies: see Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437-438. The applicant relies upon the decision of Dimella Constructions , in which the Court was asked whether s 21(5) of the Builder's Licensing Act 1967 (SA) would apply to a builder even if a charge under ss 21(2) or (11) could be defended by the common law defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. Section 21(5) stated that: Where a person has carried out or undertaken, or submitted a bid or tender, to carry out any building work in contravention of this section, he shall not be entitled to claim, or recover in any court, the amount of any fee or charge for any building work... Section 21(2) imposed a penalty on a person who held himself or herself out as having a building licence without having a licence and s 21(11) imposed a penalty for constructing a building for a fee without a licence. The conduct of the charged party satisfied the descriptions of such offences, but the Court found that he was adequately protected by the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact because he believed himself to be licensed. Bray CJ (with other judges agreeing) found at page 221 that: I think a man does not transgress a law if he is legally innocent of breaking it and entitled to acquittal if charged with a breach of it, nor, in such circumstances, does he go counter to it or come into conflict with it. At 222, Bray CJ concluded: If it is a characteristic of any contravention that it could result in a penalty after conviction for a punishable offence, then e converso when there can be no penalty, because there can be no convention because there is no punishable offence, there is no contravention. The meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '"" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with""' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293. The word has been defined in various UK statues as ' failure to comply ': see, for example, ss 5(1) and 37(1) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (UK); s 53(1) Food and Safety Act 1990 (UK). In view of the applicant's further submissions, the decision in Dimella Constructions and the preceding discussion, the Court finds itself unable to ignore the judicial findings which have had the result that all those charged with offences under the Migration Act have been acquitted. Contravention may not always equate to a criminal offence. However, due to the structure of the Criminal Code it must follow that a failure to find criminal responsibility must also lead to finding that a contravention of the relevant provisions of the Migration Act creating offences does not exist. The defence upon which the acquittals or discontinuances of the charges against the applicant and others was based, namely sudden or extraordinary emergency as provided by s 10.3 of the Criminal Code , applies equally to any offence with which the applicant or any other person on board the ship could be charged. As has been stated, the relevant question is whether the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that a contravention of the Migration Act has occurred. The Court can no longer be so satisfied that contraventions have occurred in respect of any offences under the Migration Act . Contravention of s 42 of the Migration Act"

Case1004,cited,Mutual Pools &amp; Staff Pty. Limited v The Commonwealth of Australia [1994] HCA 9 ; (1994) 179 CLR 155,the reasons in Tran No. 1 at [50]-[54] the Court reiterates that no compensation is payable since s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution does not operate in respect of the forfeiture. The ship was validly forfeited. No question of payment of compensation arises where the forfeiture results from the incidental exercise of power under the Migration Act since s 51(xxxi) ' applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms ': see Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited and Another v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another [1997] HCA 38 ; (1997) 190 CLR 513 per Gummow J at 595; see authorities referred to in Tran No. 1 at [51]-[53]; see also Mutual Pools &amp; Staff Pty.

The concept that compensation might be payable in circumstances where forfeiture has resulted from a contravention of a Commonwealth statute is incongruous: see Theophanous v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 18 ; (2006) 225 CLR 101 at [55] - [61] ; Re Director of Public Prosecutions; Ex parte Lawler and Another [1994] HCA 10 ; (1994) 179 CLR 270 at 289.
Case1005,discussed,NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161,"was submitted by the applicant that by virtue of Australia being a signatory to the Refugee Convention and following from the judgment of Kirby J in NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161 at [89] , the Court ought to read s 261A in a way which conforms with Australia's international obligations and should not be read to punish refugees. There are two primary problems with this submission. As the Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ found (at [15]) in NAGV , ...the Convention is an example of a treaty which qualifies what under classical international law theory was the freedom of States in the treatment of their nationals; but the Convention does not have the effect of conferring upon the refugees to which it applies international legal personality with capacity to act outside municipal legal systems. [footnotes omitted] Crucially, their Honours said at [17], ...Gibbs CJ and Brennan J in Mayer and Stephen J in Simsek v Macphee pointed out that the determination of the status of refugee is a function left by the Convention to the competent authorities of the Contracting States which may select such procedures as they see fit for that purpose. [footnotes omitted] It follows that the legal concept of 'refugee' is a status which is not conferred upon a person merely by the existence of circumstances sufficient to support such a claim. This status must positively be found, and it must be found according to the standards set by the particular state, in this case, Australia. Such concept is consistent with international law only having effect within Australia by virtue of its positive adoption into municipal law. Accordingly, the passengers on the ship were not refugees until such time as they were granted that status from the Australian authorities pursuant to s 36 of the Migration Act (dealing with protection visas), and that was not until well after the facts giving rise to the contravention had occurred. At their time of entry into Australia (and thus the time when the forfeiture occurred) the ship's passengers were no more than unlawful non-citizens by force of s 14 of the Migration Act . Therefore it could not be said that forfeiture of the ship would punish the applicant as a refugee, because at the relevant time he was not a refugee, and nor was anyone else on the ship. After the fact events such as the granting of refugee status cannot affect the validity of the forfeiture. Secondly, the passage relied upon by the applicants at [89] of NAGV states, ' where the words of a statute are susceptible to an interpretation that is consistent with international law, that construction should prevail over one that is not .' The key word is ' susceptible '. Section 36 is clearly intended to operate subsequently to s 261A because s 261A will occur automatically the moment a vessel enters Australia. There is nothing in s 261A that suggests that it should be limited in its operation by s 36 of the Migration Act so that it has no application to people to whom s 36 applies. Whether s 36 applies to an unlawful non-citizen may not be known until years after a vessel's entry in Australia, and s 261A is phrased as to operate instantaneously. Reading s 261A in the way the applicant submits completely ignores the wording of the section. It must therefore be concluded that it is not a provision which can be said to be ' susceptible ' in the manner discussed by Kirby J. Compensation"
Case1006,referred to,Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited and Another v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another [1997] HCA 38 ; (1997) 190 CLR 513,the reasons in Tran No. 1 at [50]-[54] the Court reiterates that no compensation is payable since s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution does not operate in respect of the forfeiture.

Case1008,followed,Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth and Another [2004] FCAFC 262 ; (2004) 143 FCR 449,"appeal (see Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth and Another [2004] FCAFC 262 ; (2004) 143 FCR 449) the Full Court explicitly adopted the findings of French J that forfeiture under s 106A of the FMA took place without conviction for any offence. As to the condemnation procedure provided by s 106B to s 106G of the FMA, the Full Court in Olbers [2004] FCAFC 262 ; 143 FCR 449 , adopting the reasoning in Whim Creek Consolidated NL v Colgan [1991] FCA 467 ; (1991) 31 FCR 469 at 477-478, determined that such provision enabled the recording of the forfeiture having already occured: see Olbers [2004] FCAFC 262 ; 143 FCR 449 at [16] - [17] ; Tran No. 1 at [43]."
Case1009,followed,Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia and Another [2004] FCA 229 ; (2004) 136 FCR 67,"Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia and Another [2004] FCA 229 ; (2004) 136 FCR 67 at 79, French J, referring to s 106A of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (Cth) ('the FMA'), addressed the question whether a conviction for an offence was necessary before forfeiture could occur under the provisions of that section. Such section provides for the forfeiture to the Commonwealth of boats, traps and other things used in offences against various provisions of that Act. His Honour said at [79]: It was contended for the applicants that before s 106A could operate to effect forfeiture of a boat or its equipment or catch it was necessary that there be a conviction for one or more of the offences upon which such forfeiture was said to arise. As a matter of construction this proposition cannot be sustained. Where there has been a conviction for an offence forfeiture can be ordered by the convicting court under s 106. Section 106A does not require any judicial determination to give effect to the forfeiture for which it provides albeit a judicial determination may be made if the occurrence of the forfeiture is contested in later proceedings. In such proceedings a civil court may make a finding whether the boat has been used in one of the specified offences. Absent the institution of such proceedings within 30 days of a notice of seizure under s 106C the asserted forfeiture will be put beyond question by operation of s 106E. That process requires no conviction to have been recorded. I reject the contention that s 106A depends for its application upon a conviction for one or more of the offences mentioned in it."
Case1010,distinguished,Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Valuer General (No 2); Trust Co of Australia Ltd and Another v Valuer General (No 2) [2007] SASC 340 ; (2007) 99 SASR 251,applicant drew the Court's attention to Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Valuer General (No 2); Trust Co of Australia Ltd and Another v Valuer General (No 2) [2007] SASC 340 ; (2007) 99 SASR 251 as supporting its proposition that the findings in Tran No. 1 could be reconsidered. In that decision Debelle J found that such principle that findings cannot be reconsidered should not ' apply to an interlocutory judgment determining a question of statutory construction ' where no evidence had been led and where the assumptions upon which the preliminary questions were argued were later found to be erroneous.
Case1011,referred to,R v Ampi Hungan [2000] NTSC 84,"this conclusion, the Migration Act has nevertheless been contravened by the applicant because of a breach of s 42 of the Migration Act , as was found in Tran No. 1 at [48]. In Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa (1997) 139 FLR 265 Angel J said at 270: They intended to so enter without a visa. Thus they intended to enter in contravention of the Migration Act , not in the sense of being in breach of an express provision to do so I note s 42 relates to travelling to Australia without a visa rather than entering Australia without a visa but in the sense of disregarding the visa requirements of the Act. The Sri Lankans did not in fact commit any offence created by the Act, nor did they intend to commit any offence created by the Act. They nonetheless intended to contravene the Act in the sense I have mentioned, that is, to enter in disregard of the visa requirements of the Act. Angel ACJ expressly refused to follow one aspect of Rutu in R v Ampi Hungan [2000] NTSC 84 , however, that aspect of Rutu is irrelevant for current purposes. His Honour's finding in relation to s 42 is unambiguous and the Court respectfully follows the finding of Angel J. As has been stated, s 261A does not require a section of the Migration Act creating an offence to have been contravened for forfeiture to occur. All that it requires is that the Migration Act be contravened in such a way as to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Travelling to Australia without a visa is a contravention of s 42 of the Migration Act , and such act in the circumstances constituted a convention sufficient to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Pursuant to the text of s 4A of the Migration Act the defences under the Criminal Code only apply to offences under the Migration Act , and thus cannot apply to a contravention of s 42 which is not framed as an offence."
Case1012,referred to,R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273,"can be no doubt that the Criminal Code was intended to provide a principled and logical analytical regime for Commonwealth criminal law and thus substantially remove inconsistencies found in the common law. For example, the defence of necessity at common law did not apply to murder: see R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273. However, the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency is not so limited in the Criminal Code and it applies to all Commonwealth offences. The Criminal Code codified a basis for criminal responsibility distinct from that at common law as discussed in R v Oblach [2005] NSWCCA 440 ; (2005) 65 NSWLR 75. Spigelman CJ said of the structure of the Criminal Code (at [28]): Criminal responsibility under the Code arises from the combined effect of the presence of the elements in Pt 2.2 [General Principles of Criminal Responsibility] and the absence or failure of the elements in Pt 2.3 [Circumstances in which there is no Criminal Responsibility]. This structure differs from the position at common law in which it is appropriate to treat certain matters as ""defences"", for example, self defence is ""exculpatory"". ( Zecevic (at 658-659)).

Case1015,referred to,Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341,"meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '"" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with""' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293.

Generally, authorities show that in ascertaining the meaning of the word the most important consideration is the statutory framework within which the word operates. For example, in Centennial Coal , Barrett J defined contravention as conventionally meaning that which was mentioned above, but went on to say: In the present context, however, ""contravention"" must be accepted as having a wider meaning. Section 1322(4)(a) is a remedial provision and the word ""contravention"" must, therefore, ""be read in a very wide sense""... Can one contravene an offence section if a defence is available?"
Case1016,referred to,Re Director of Public Prosecutions; Ex parte Lawler and Another [1994] HCA 10 ; (1994) 179 CLR 270 at 289,the reasons in Tran No. 1 at [50]-[54] the Court reiterates that no compensation is payable since s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution does not operate in respect of the forfeiture. The ship was validly forfeited. No question of payment of compensation arises where the forfeiture results from the incidental exercise of power under the Migration Act since s 51(xxxi) ' applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms ': see Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited and Another v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another [1997] HCA 38 ; (1997) 190 CLR 513 per Gummow J at 595; see authorities referred to in Tran No. 1 at [51]-[53]; see also Mutual Pools &amp; Staff Pty. Limited v The Commonwealth of Australia [1994] HCA 9 ; (1994) 179 CLR 155 per Brennan J at 177; The Commonwealth of Australia v WMC Resources Limited [1998] HCA 8 ; (1998) 194 CLR 1 per Brennan CJ at [10]-[13]; Gaudron J at [75]-[79]. The concept that compensation might be payable in circumstances where forfeiture has resulted from a contravention of a Commonwealth statute is incongruous: see Theophanous v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 18 ; (2006) 225 CLR 101 at [55] - [61] ; Re Director of Public Prosecutions; Ex parte Lawler and Another [1994] HCA 10 ; (1994) 179 CLR 270 at 289.
Case1017,referred to,Re Venice Nominees Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager appointed) (In liquidation) (1992) 108 FLR 237,"word 'contravention' may mean a breach of the law, but 'contravention' ' does not necessarily involve the commission of an offence unless the Act or law otherwise makes it so ': see Re Venice Nominees Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager appointed) (In liquidation) (1992) 108 FLR 237 at 242 referred to in Tran No. 1 at [28]. Conduct may be proscribed by Parliament, and the finding that such conduct has occurred may lead to the conclusion that a contravention of the law has occurred without an offence having been committed. However, facts may exist to satisfy a court that conduct constitutes not only a contravention, but simultaneously an offence. The text of the relevant statute must be considered in order to decide whether contravention means merely a breach of its provisions or commission of an offence. The applicant invites the Court to find that because the word 'offences' is used in the heading of s 261A, the conclusion must be reached that the word 'contravention' used in s 261A should be limited only to a contravention of those sections of the Migration Act which create offences. Pursuant to s 15AB(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act extrinsic material can be considered as an aid to interpretation where the text of the provision itself is ' ambiguous or obscure '. By s 13(3) the heading to a section does not form part of the statute. However, by s 15AB(2)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act the headings to sections comprise extrinsic material. Therefore, the pivotal consideration is whether the text of s 261A is ambiguous or obscure, so as to enable the Court to refer to the heading of s 261A when interpreting that section. The meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '"" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with""' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293. The word has been defined in various UK statues as ' failure to comply ': see, for example, ss 5(1) and 37(1) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (UK); s 53(1) Food and Safety Act 1990 (UK)."
Case1018,followed,Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa (1997) 139 FLR 265,"this conclusion, the Migration Act has nevertheless been contravened by the applicant because of a breach of s 42 of the Migration Act , as was found in Tran No. 1 at [48]. In Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa (1997) 139 FLR 265 Angel J said at 270: They intended to so enter without a visa. Thus they intended to enter in contravention of the Migration Act , not in the sense of being in breach of an express provision to do so I note s 42 relates to travelling to Australia without a visa rather than entering Australia without a visa but in the sense of disregarding the visa requirements of the Act. The Sri Lankans did not in fact commit any offence created by the Act, nor did they intend to commit any offence created by the Act. They nonetheless intended to contravene the Act in the sense I have mentioned, that is, to enter in disregard of the visa requirements of the Act. Angel ACJ expressly refused to follow one aspect of Rutu in R v Ampi Hungan [2000] NTSC 84 , however, that aspect of Rutu is irrelevant for current purposes. His Honour's finding in relation to s 42 is unambiguous and the Court respectfully follows the finding of Angel J. As has been stated, s 261A does not require a section of the Migration Act creating an offence to have been contravened for forfeiture to occur. All that it requires is that the Migration Act be contravened in such a way as to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Travelling to Australia without a visa is a contravention of s 42 of the Migration Act , and such act in the circumstances constituted a convention sufficient to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Pursuant to the text of s 4A of the Migration Act the defences under the Criminal Code only apply to offences under the Migration Act , and thus cannot apply to a contravention of s 42 which is not framed as an offence."
