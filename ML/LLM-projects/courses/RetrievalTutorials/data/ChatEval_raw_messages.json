If I add in a opportunity stage look up and only filter by Closed Won opps, the renewal data is correct but the revenue data is funky, if I DONT filter by the Closed Won look up, the revenue data is correct but the renewal dates are showing in the past? Apparently it's something to do with how Planhat categorise 'ongoing' licenses but I can't work out how that would impact the license having the wrong data on it. Does this make any sense....?

You are also able to narrow the scope of field mappings so that you are able to manage scaling into the sync. We run on enterprise for both platforms and have been able to manage 90% monthly accuracy. What I can call out with enterprise is that the limit accepted by Salesforce is 1,500 API calls per 15 minutes which comes out to the ability to sync about 300 records in that 15 minute cycle.\n\nIn short, using both platforms isn't a challenge as long as your team is familiar with managing multiple integrations.\n\nIMO, I would let your team run with what they are comfortable with. One last recommendation, make sure to build a culture of documenting processes and workflows in both systems. It'll save you from growing pains down the line.",

We also have an internal database that stores all of the data we need to power our software. As a result, we have unique records in this database that represent the same accounts &amp; contacts that exist in Salesforce, a scenario I'm sure is common across software companies.\n\nWe're now at a point where we'd like each entity (a single account or a single contact) matched across systems so that we can start pulling data together between the two systems.\n\nA simple example would be to show me user engagement (internal DB) for our top 10 accounts by revenue (Salesforce). Right now, because we don't have a link across the two systems, we'd have to pull a quick report in Salesforce to see the top accounts, then build a report in AWS Quicksight and manually select those accounts. I think what we need is a way to maintain a table of IDs across these 2 systems (and any others we want to include), dump all the data we need from both systems into AWS, then build combined reports insight of Quicksight.\n\nWould love to chat to anyone with strong recommendations or insights on this topic. Thanks in advance!",

Helps a lot with tracking.\n3. *Control Who Sees What:* Keep the MultiYear Opps limited to the people who really need to see them, like your RevOps team.\n4. *Use Salesforce for Reports:* Get creative with Salesforce reports to keep an eye on these multi-year deals.\n5. *Keep Data Tidy:* Make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page about how to enter contract details.\n6. *Keep Tweaking:* Always look for ways to improve the process.\nBut, like <@Ud9a555e> said, this may end up causing issues further down the line and given your needs, a CPQ is probably your best bet.\n\nI may be bias, but <http://DealHub.io|DealHub.io> seems like a great option as it natively integrates with Salesforce and makes managing complex deals a whole lot smoother. Best of all, implementation takes weeks rather than months and there's no six figure implementation with a third party required.\n\nWorth checking out if you're juggling a bunch of multi-year contracts. Keep it flexible and adapt as you go, If you are interested in learning more, feel free to lmk!",

        "text": "<@U45bf13a> Usage based is similar, although maybe the nuances are slightly different. For example with Brex and Ramp, I believe customers tell them how much money in transactions they make in a specific period, which maybe they commit to. Then there\u2019s ramping up spend of those customers to get to full commitment/utilization, and the details of how reps are comped or clawed back on that level of spend onboarding. These are the details I\u2019m looking to learn more about, or if it\u2019s done very different from what I described.\n\nI\u2019m guessing there\u2019s no such nuance for usage based like Snowflake, Fivetran, Twilio, etc. where there would be an expected usage. But I would be curious to see how reps get paid when there\u2019s no consistent recurring revenue and how deals/opportunities are captured in Salesforce.\n\nIf my questions above are relevant, mind if I reach out?",

The main differences are limited scope and time.\n\nBut agree with you and it makes sense to go with option 2.\n\nI just have a few follow-up questions, I hope that is okay.\n1. Are you able to share some examples how your company are registering Pilots under different record types? \n2. Next question is related to pipeline mgmt., - Do you agree to below process? \nIf a paid pilot is agreed, we will mark the \u201ccustomer\u201d as won with the tag \u201cPilot\u201d and register the bookings under lets said Pilot subscription.  We also register a new opportunity in pipeline and mark as won or lost depending on the customers decision. And then evaluate the conversion rate of pilots.\n\nThank you so much for your help and guidance \u2013 I really appreciate it!\n\nBR Mikkel",

        "text": "1. I would add specific record types to the opportunity, record and account record with values for \u201cpilot\u201c and probably have to manually select this every time once one comes through. Reason is you might have difficulty automating this process given you don\u2019t necessarily know when Customer would like a pilot or not unless there is something you can automate already. Advantage of doing this as well is that you can create your own set of fields and layout for pilots as they usually require a specific process in itself and more easily segment when reporting.\n2. I do generally agree with this approach. The only thing I would ask you to think about is if you want that pilot opportunity to be marked as closed won already or left open Until the pilot actually completes. It really highly depends on your process here as I have seen customers do it both ways, but you should be fine either way. The advantage of leaving it open is that once it does actually convert into an opportunity you don\u2019t have to create another record and it might be easier to count conversions from stage to stage rather than record to record. On the other hand, you could still easily do that with some excel or SQL, and maybe even salesforce itself.",

Currently &gt;95% of our business is inbound driven, SMB and lower MM, and the sales team is based out of India.\n\nOur biggest goal is to reduce CAC since inbound lead gen costs are insanely high. So we have newly constituted an outbound team based in the US.\n\nMy challenge is around finding a model that would fit this. The Field team is taking up a fairly high target for the year. If I were to keep inbound and outbound separate swimlanes, I foresee a lot of conflicts around lead ownership, and resolution through double comp that might not entirely solve the problem of reducing CAC.\n\nIf I were to split it by the org/opp size, I see operational challenges around passing on lead ownership which can be solved through tight sales processes and handoffs but given the high target for the Field team, I want to ensure they have a fair share of the pie to go after.\n\nHas anyone had experience in solving for an ROE model similar to this?

Over my first year at Minitab I've built out a full RevOps team that handles commissions, tech stack, territory/account management, misc. project management, sales enablement, channel ops, etc. As my team is ramping up, I am looking towards the evolution of my role where I'll be focused more on supporting our CRO and senior sales leaders with different strategic initiatives and improvements.\n\nSince I will be getting out of the day to day and a lot of the general project management, I am looking to build systems to create the right visibility and accountability with my team. One of the tools I've deployed for my team is Asana, knowing this evolution of the team was inevitable (task management / project management).\n\nHas anyone gone through a similar transition from building/doing to leading and supporting larger initiatives? I'm curious what sort of system they've put in place to allow for the proper visibility, accountability, and resource management for proper delegation with a global sales ops team. It will likely be a combination of meetings, reports, and muscle memory with asana, but I'm hoping to focus on the right things at the right time now that I'm ready to get out of the weeds a bit more.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have this type of organizational experience - I'd love to learn from those of you that have effectively built out teams like this from the ground up.",

It has been causing us a lot of issues due to how similar SLED  accounts are that are located in the same area.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say we have 5 accounts in our salesforce instance.\n1. Broward College South Campus\n2. Broward College North Campus\n3. Broward College\nAll 3 of these are in the same state and city and all use the same city and state, use the same email domains and websites. Unless it\u2019s a exact match on a company name, it\u2019s really hard to make sure leads are matched properly to accounts.\n\nWe have similar issues with State/Local/Fire Accounts as well.

Same goes for expansions, but the counter argument here is that the sales team have a more \u201csalesy\u201d personality and are better \u201csuited\u201d for that, so sometimes CSMs own the renewals and expansions belong to AEs.

For user inserted data I try to minimize the inputs to what I actually need to measure and give them the easiest means of writing said data as I can. You can validate truly needed fields but I would also create a clean your room dashboard for the rest. Automate every thing that isn\u2019t of key importance. Most of the time data entry issues are caused by there being too much of it.\n\nFor cpq fields like discounts and stuff I would focus on creating a highway, 90% of traffic should get through while only true outliers get flagged. For outliers have an established review process. The goal here should be to minimize the review and streamline. Again have a dashboard to track outliers.\n\nCreate a semimonthly data review meeting with leadership to go over where things are working and where they aren\u2019t. 30 minutes keep it tight, and just bring light to the dark places.

For mid-market, it may be fine to make changes except for the first/last three business days each month.\n\nFor ESMB, there be less concern about accurate instrumentation &amp; risk mitigation and more focus on time-to-value. These organizations should include time-to-value estimates and risk reviews for requests to make changes to CRM to be effective the first or last week of any month.\n\nThis might look like a benefit estimate from the requestor, an expense and duration estimate from the delivery team that is laid out on a project board to gauge capacity impacts and gain buy-in from stakeholders to make the change with visibility to the trade-offs and targeted outcome.",

If you are unemployed and you have time to do it, do it, but keep a keen eye on what that says about their culture. For example, where I had that experience what it (should have) told me was no one can make a decision about a damn thing, theres no accountability, and unclear stakeholders. The exact same pain points that caused me to leave the company.\n\nI was in enterprise SaaS for a long time, left to do consulting, and co-founded a SaaS company where I'm now COO. Happy to chat with you and if I can help in your job search happy to do that!",

Once you have this narrative, it should drive your marketing strategy, influence how you think about building your brand, and educate bdr/sales on how to deliver a strong experience through a discovery and sales process \n\n\u2022 What core challenges do your customers typically face\n\u2022 How do they become aware of those challenges \n\u2022 How do they educate themselves on achieving outcomes related to those challenges (what channels, communities, mediums of content)\n\u2022 How do they like to be engaged with\n\u2022 how do they become aware of your firm, or other marketing services firms\n\u2022 What are the decision criteria they think about when deciding to partner with a vendor like your firm \n\u2022 what is the experience they have first engaging with your firm? Is it educational? Are you selling to them? Providing free thought leadership? Are they being cold called? \n\u2022 what does the discovery process look like - how are you aligning with them on understanding the pain they\u2019re experiencing and positioning your servicss as THE solution\n\u2022 What\u2019s the process to align on a joint impact plan (SOW in your case) \n\u2022 what does the buying committee look like? Is it just the head of marketing + cfo/budget holder? Is broader consensus required? How do they sell ROI internally on your behalf ",

For example, when I worked in the building materials industry our commission was 2% of profits - an average rep sold around 20 million a year, at a 20% profit margin which is 4 million, and 2% of that is 80K. Fast forward to the mobile crm business where it would range from 8-12% of the total sale, 12% being New ARR that was self-sourced and 8% for Renewal ARR. That being said with the little bit of info above, its hard to give you any type of going commission. From my experience within tech it can be anywhere between 5-30%.",

However, there are some challenges with the approach like companies being headquartered somewhere else from the workforce) - Ikea=Liechtenstein, Stellantis=Netherlands (Jeep, Chrysler, Citroen, Peugeot, Fiat\u2026).\nWhat do you guys use as criteria to \u201cbox\u201d the regions?",

Is entity you are selling to independent and different to the one you already have? Then its a new opportunity with a new account and contract. So VW automotive for example is one, porsche would be another but porsche might have a subdivision you might want to sell to. If that is the same as the billing entity you already sold to, I would class it as upsell. If the entity has a different billing and buying process, then I would class it as new",

How frequent are you updating your data? weekly/bi-weekly/bi-monthly? (are you updating both existing data or new accounts/contacts/leads only, or both)\n3. Which critical fields are you updating (industry, employees)\n4. Which tools do you use to make sure your contacts are up-to-date in terms of COMPANY and TITLE? ",

Most of the answers to your questions are dependent on your business and whats important for you. Having said that, I usually run update batches quarterly or semi-yearly as most account data does not change significantly in a short period of time. Contacts is different as it changes more often. I update only when a significant potion is detected as outdated to avoid wasting credits. Primarily update existing and new contacts and then accounts as a priority. Leads you can leave for BdRs to qualify and update\n3. industry, employees, address, size band, seed round depending, this highly varies\n4. Same as the one I pointed out in point 1.",

We have job changes alerts setup in the platform so when someone changes title or company, it will update them and we can even notify the rep.\n\nAs a secondary layer for enrichment for imports, we use Clay to source data from multiple sources such as Clearbit, Apollo and Clay's other included data sources. It has rules for what we determine is most accurate for data enrichment, but honestly, we end up leaning towards Apollo data because Apollo uses a network of one million data contributors including LinkedIn, email engagement tools, public data crawling, and vetted third-party data providers.\n\nFor data points, we push everything Apollo gives us and only overwrite Job Title, Last Funding info, Annual Revenue, Number of Employees and any other fields that we expect to change as times goes on for a company and contact\n\nIn short, Apollo can do all of it and it's more affordable than a lot of the other options. We've even seen that it can enrich 20% more data than Clearbit. We have enrichment running on our forms in Clay and we can clearly see that Clearbit can't find about 20% of the people who fill out the forms, but Apollo finds them and the data is accurate.",

        "text": "<@U45c5592> - As you probably found out, you can't move Lifecycle Stages backwards in workflows unless you clear the Lifecycle Stage which completely wipes the native conversion dates for each stage. This is why we use custom conversion timestamp fields so this doesn't get wiped out. However, when it comes to combining lifecycle stage conversion with attribution, we are running into a lot of challenges using only custom fields. I'm thinking of using a Custom Object to report on conversion so we can have a record of each conversion, the source, the timestamps, and it's 100% flexible, can scale up or down with custom fields, has a pipeline for visualizing the movement, and can be utilized in cross-object reporting. This provides a much more robust method to what is natively in HubSpot and circumvents a lot of the challenges with data remediation.\n\nOf course, I use custom coded actions to do the associations between other objects such as tickets and deals, so that does become important. You can use other platforms such as Make, n8n, etc to do these as well, but it's more cost effective running those in the HubSpot platform. Maybe one day I'll make this into an app for the marketplace. lol",

If you do cut headcount determine which functions or people are ESSENTIAL. Cutting these folks would seriously impact the business's ability to operate\n4. Loop in leaders and establish non disclosure policies\n5. If the company feels democratic around the process it will do a bottoms up submission list. Managers submit who will stay.\n6. Top down review of the submitted list will actually help reach the cost cutting target\n7. HR reviews list for any potential violations or lawsuit risk (i.e. disproportionately firing one legally protected group over another, such as firing all females or all LGBT employees)",

Otherwise, it will become a primary reason why plan is being missed, why your FLMs have a hard time hiring external candidates, why you're seeing regrettable rep attrition\n    a. Why is it important for the business\n    b. How does it tie to corporate objectives / shareholder and Exec priorities\n    c. Why was it translated to sales comp plans in this fashion\n    d. What alternatives were considered, and why was this the best option\n2. Both sales leadership and central ops / exec team need to articulate the same message to the broader sales org and give unified responses to push back\n3. Rev Ops / enablement needs to develop materials for the reps to understand the rational for the change, what revenue is, how it's calculated, how it's different from prior core KPI (presumably bookings), and *what it means for their individual compensation.* If they repeat last year's performance this year, will they earn more? Less? the same? Same but over a longer period? \n*Administering the change internally*\n1. Jeff highlighted some of the key items you'll need to think about. Delivery services could be based on % completion, when delivered, or linear over time of the engagement. Software is over the lifetime of the engagement. Partner products may be recognized gross or net of COGS (agent vs principal accounting)\n2. Are you administering this at a deal level? If so, do you lock FX rates or do they change? Does it matter if the deal is booked in HQ versus a subsidiary that has a functional currency different from your parent company? \n3. How do you account for writeoffs and bad debt provision accrual? What if something is written of and subsequently collected?\n4. When will accounting be hard closed on revenue monthly? How about at year end? Will this impact the lead time to take final revenue results and run them through the payroll calcs? \n5. Do unbilled accruals impact revenue for ICs?\n6. What, if any, accounting adjustments done topside will affect revenue for an IC?\n7. How will you get revenue details into SF? Your CRM is not the source of truth for revenue, your ERP is. You could 'hack' a revenue calculation in the CRM as a proxy, but it won't directly reconcile to the revenue number your accounting team comes up with. Is the ELT OK with that? If not, how are you going to bring accounting adjustments into the CRM at a deal level when a lot of the revenue adjustments don't happen at that level of granularity",

Do the reps really want a long how-to handbook or do they want sharing of how others do it, what makes some successful at CRM and others not. \n\nLast point, consider a looser term like a framework/playbook, similar to the checklist comments. Your CRM will adapt over time so you need something that is flexible and easy to digest to get a single answer. My sales team prefers the term playbook as it implies less intense \u201cdo it this way\u201d but \u201cthese are the best practices\u201d\n\nOtherwise, definitely take it chunk by chunk and get buy-in along the way (from sales leaders, SDRs, AEs) so you know you\u2019re on the right track before a larger roll-out \n\nGood luck!!",

If the company has been going for a couple years you can identify this through looking at the overall customer base and identifying common threads to develop your ICP, but if the company is just getting started, it may be a bit more tricky and may take further consulting to determine the right firmographics.\n\nWe can also make some assumptions as well if the company is just getting started based on available resources and research. Typically companies with a greater chance of loan repayment have common attributes that speak to their overall financial stability.\n\nSo you're looking for companies that have a lower amount of employees (5-50 employees), with greater longevity (company started 5-10 yrs ago vs 1-4 years ago), and higher annual revenue ($5M+), and also look for industries that typically have more stable financials (Healthcare, Accommodations, Agriculture).\n\nYou can use <https://www.apollo.io/|Apollo >to source companies and leads for the above scenario.\n\nThere's a great article on Forbes about this topic: <https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-loans/small-business-loan-statistics/>",

Currently, when a new contact is added to a Company who is a current customer of ours (Lifecycle Stage = Customer), we have an automation that moves them through automatically through all of the lifecycle stages (from Subscriber to Customer) since we want to be able to identify that they're already a customer.\n\nHowever, this messes up our reporting since it can sometimes inflate our MQL / SQL numbers and also looks odd in funnel reporting since it looks like they moved through the lifecycle super quickly. Would it be best to skip all of the previous lifecycle stages and go straight to customer in this case? Has anyone dealt with a similar scenario in the past?",

If they never became a Lead via conversion on a form and sales never pursued them, then they should also not be a lead. Not every contact associated to a company has to be in the LS flow.\n\nAs you probably are finding out, HubSpot's native lifecycle stage infrastructure is not optimal. I've worked for both Elite and Diamond HubSpot partner agencies specifically as a developer and consultant and ran into LS challenges often.\n\nHow I  circumvent the issues:\n1. Use custom timestamp properties and lock adjustments to Super Admins.\n2. Turn of all native LS automations.\n3. Use customer journey report vs funnels (funnels require that contacts have touched either all or the starting stage so it removes a lot of contacts from the reporting.)\nThe customer journey reporting shows me the dropoff, and conversion from stage to stage but it's not required that contacts have touched every stage.\n\nAlso, I'm more interested in Lead to C/W conversion on the RevOps side.\n\nHow many leads did either marketing or sales generate, did they convert to a demo (if in SaaS), then opportunity, then did they close. We don't care about the other contacts in the CRM right. We care about accurate conversion. So be very picky on who you include in your LS funnel reports.\n\nQuality over quantity,",

        "text": "I\u2019ve typically seen something in between the two.  I\u2019ve always used it as a prediction of how much revenue can I expect out of the current qualified pipeline per day or month. So separating each piece of the equation into what\u2019s open vs what historical metrics can help inform what will happen to what is open is how I view it.  You can determine how much revenue was brought in over a historical time period based on closed deals, which is why I don\u2019t like to use closed & open deals in the first part of the equation. It\u2019s a known historical entity.  With this formula you\u2019re trying to forecast out what will happen based on your current open pipe \n\n(Num qualified open deals * avg historical deal size * win rate) / (historical days to close post qualification) \n\nThe historical deal size, win rate, and time to close should all be calculated over the same time period\n\nThere are also a bunch of dependencies depending on your pipeline hygeine.  If you\u2019ve got a bunch of aged deals that reps refuse to close and are going no where it will swing this number.  You may want to build in exclusions for aged open deals. (Although I hate doing this in the metric and would rather convince people on the pipeline hygiene front) \n\nIn terms of the conversion vs win rate.  I\u2019m a pretty firm believer to use your method of closed won / (closed won + qualified closed lost).  \n\nI won\u2019t lie though.  I like to look at the individual pieces far more than one big number.  If you have a low sales velocity, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you have an underperforming sales team, it could mean you have an understaffed sales team.  They don\u2019t have the resources to move through the leads coming in.  \n\nDepending on your business as well. Doing this all up for the business could get dicey.  I\u2019d want to look at it based on some segmentation of your sales.  Enterprise vs smb, industry. Or a combination of other things.  I\u2019ve seen large enterprise deals completely sway these metrics especially in the average deal size and time to close and hide a ton of issues in quicker moving deal segments. ",

It would be useful to share what types of requests can be actioned without manager approval (e.g. list builds) and what types require higher authority. Or perhaps you limit who can submit a ticket, but depending on the size of your org and your team's remit that may not be possible.",

What I mean by that - we don\u2019t check if the opp has not been touched in the last X days. Instead the rep marks when the next action needs to happen and few days before that we leave a reminder notification. This was helpful because when we sent out notifications based on if an opp had no activity in last X days, a lot of times we heard from the rep that it\u2019s because they asked us to circle back 3 weeks later and they still had time. So it ended up frustrating the rep more than anything. When we started to send alerts based on when the next action was scheduled, reps found the alerts genuinely helpful ",

You cannot find these records when going to build a report unless something has changed in the last year.\n\nI would still double check with support or in recent updates, but I believe that is it for activity capture.",

The folks that do that are dedicated technology professionals who can attract, organize, and inspire the caliber of people needed to deliver at that scale.\n\nHappy to chat more if you're interested, <@Uc185c71>",

        "text": "Hi Team,\n\nEach AE in our organization manages approximately 100 accounts that align with our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and were selected through analytical methods. Our Salesforce system integrates with tools like 6Sense, Apollo, LinkedIn, and Google Calendar. However, we're *facing challenges with duplicate activity records in SFDC*, leading to inaccuracies in account activity tracking. We use Clari too and while Clari offers account-level engagement metrics, sales managers prefer using SFDC for monitoring.\n\nTo address these issues, I have two key questions:\n1. Q1: Best Practices for Inspecting AE's Account Activity:\n    \u25e6 Can anyone share effective practices for monitoring AE account activities within a specific tool (preferably SFDC)? How do you ensure accuracy and avoid duplication in activity tracking?\n2. Q2 : Recent Benchmarks for Outbound Activity:\n    \u25e6 What are the recent benchmarks for outbound activities (e-mails, phone calls, LinkedIn messages, social posts) required to penetrate accounts effectively? While we have conducted a bottoms-up analysis to set expectations and goals, additional insights into industry benchmarks would be valuable. I don't remember but perhaps I saw something on Linkedin by Jeremy or some other member\nThank you in advance!",

        "text": "Really good questions - I\u2019ll tackle #1 first:\n\n1. check to make sure you have <https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-activities/|shared activities enabled> - when enabled Salesforce (and most email tools) will log 1 activity and relate multiple contacts\u2026instead of logging an activity per contact on an email thread\n2. most tools that sync activities to Salesforce have unique identifiers or syntax to help you determine what tools are syncing these Tasks. If you don\u2019t know where the duplicates are coming from, you should start here to see if it\u2019s multiple tools or in fact one. If it\u2019s just one tool, then maybe shared activities solves the problem! If it\u2019s multiple, then you\u2019ll want to investigate those tools to turn off activity syncing.\n3. If you want to invest time in cleaning up historical duplicate activity data, just know it will be very manual. You could probably take a first pass at matching: assigned, date, subject, description. But you\u2019re going to need to be careful about the \u201cRelated To\u201d field because some records could look like dupes, but the same activity was logged to multiple contacts\n4. Create a one pager or video for your GTM team that\u2019s syncing activity to show them how to enable activity sync properly - include as a checklist item in your new hire onboarding",

Currently, data snapshots are available in Google Sheets so that would certainly get around problem #1. For problem #2 as long as you can built a report in a spreadsheet and refer back to the different data import tabs in your formulas, you can use Coefficient successfully to solve this. We also have AI functionality to help you build your formulas as well!\n\nIt's completely free to try (and is just an extension/add-in for your spreadsheet).

        "text": "Hey <@U000e2d8> yeah happy to share\n\n*First - my  philosophy on account scoring / ICP:*\n\nAccount scoring should be a proxy for two underlying metrics which describe an account's \"propensity to buy\" and their \"propensity to remain a customer\" - Acquisition cost and Lifetime Value. If you focus the GTM org on accounts that have the highest lifetime value while taking into account the cost to land a customer of that type, that's how you optimize your GTM motion. Applies equally to marketing as it does sales and BD.\n\n*Execution:*\n\nStep 1: enrich your CRM with whatever data you can obtain with a reliable degree of accuracy:\n\u2022 Industry & subindustry\n\u2022 $ revenue & # employees\n\u2022 Country\n\u2022 Number of target personas at the company (from linkedin sales insights, for example)\n\u2022 Technographic info (from third party sites, CRM notes, call recordings, win/loss analysis)\n\u2022 Marketing engagement (website traffic, content downloads if gated, attendance of virtual or live events, etc)\nStep 2: To solve for LTV - do historical analysis on net retention and average landed dealsize based on various combinations of the above datapoints, and assign a score (out of 10 or 100, for example). We landed on scoring by segment, by industry (with separate score per segment), and by country (with separate score per segment.\n\nStep 3: Gather whatever CRM data you have available on historical opptys:\n\u2022 Win/loss rate\n\u2022 Number of touchpoints required to book first meeting\n\u2022 Number of meetings required to close the deal\n\u2022 level of internal support/resources required to close the deal\n\u2022 Level of marketing engagement. Was it an ABM account? How many pieces of content did they download? How many events did they attend pre/during the deal cycle?\nStep 4: To solve for CAC - evaluate how much effort is required to close opportunities per segment, industry, geography, possibly based on which persona you first made contact with, and assign a score (out of 10 or 100 for example)\n\nStep 5: optional - factor in intent scoring from a platform like 6sense or demandbase to account for companies that may not be a top scoring account but are high intent / decision or purchase stage\n\nStep 6: Decide which parameters you're ultimately going to use for account scoring, and what weights to attribute to each.\n\nStep 7: run the scoring model over your enriched account data, sync the scores to your CRM.\n\nStep 8: Build a workflow in the CRM to enable either revops/ops or sales FLMs to drop and add accounts at scale based on the score of existing rep territories versus the scoring that you cam up with from your model",

Quick question,\n\u2022 We're currently dealing with an organization in 2 different regions, let's call them ABC UK and ABC US.\n\u2022 ABC UK &amp; ABC US both became our customers at separate points in time, with different stakeholders, contracts, billing cycles, plans, etc. associated with them. As such, we've been managing them as two entirely separate customers. \n\u2022 Now, after years, due to a change in their internal dynamics, they've decided to merge into one entity. They've cancelled the ABC UK contract and confirmed an upsell on the ABC US contract such that users that were previously under ABC UK can continue using the tool.\n\u2022 How would you manage the revenue from these customers? If we count ABC UK as churned and ABC US as upsold, it would impact our LTV calculations as well as our target setting for 2024, since it would throw off our forecasts. Any ideas on how we would solve for this?\nThanks in advance! :slightly_smiling_face:",

Quick question about how to approach inbound and outbound call outcomes :slack_call:\n\nWhat fields/values would you set up in your dialer when you have both a sales team handling outbound &amp; inbound calls and a customer support team handling inbound calls?\n\nAt the moment we tell our reps to input who is calling (prospect, customer, partner, etc.) and the reason they\u2019re calling (whether they\u2019re calling for help on pricing, product, etc). But when they call outbound, we ask them to add a disposition (busy, voicemail, connected etc) and a sentiment if connected (demo scheduled, no interest, timeline, etc).\n\nI think there is a broader question here as to what is important to know when someone is calling and when we\u2019re calling someone.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s complexity for the sake of it and can probably be much simpler with a maximum of 2 fields.

Or because they actually wanted to customize the email asking for more information? Or something else?\n\nFor example we're building a AI-enabled proposal automation platform (taking company information / pitch decks / prior proposals, and using it to help write a great first draft proposal automatically) and we're hyper-aware of some of the underlying motivations that users may have to our software (usually \u2014 \"will it take our jobs\", even if not explicitly said). We have to address this upfront and make it clear that it's an enabler instead of a replacer, and in fact will make their outcomes even better.\n\n_Generally_ speaking, most of the sales teams I've worked with (across being an investor, within the team, or with sales teams as customers) are primarily driven by desire to maximize sales and commissions, so to the extent that you are able to drive \"small wins\" and prove that it directly led to them making more money will certainly get them interested and bought in.

My goal is to use RevOps tools (e.g., Hubspot, Mixpanel, etc.) from companies that have products installed or I will implement them.  Should I consider a financial arrangement or treat it as an unpaid internship?\n\nThanks in advance for advice on my journey.",

This review is in conjunction with our Finance team - at the top of the hour they present our P&amp;L info, profit per client and at each consultant level (jr/mid/sr/director/etc) as well as how each project did for the month prior and in comparison to the year before. In the second half of the hour, I present our sales pipeline, what it is today, how it compares to last year this time and what the mix is (amount, deal mix, new biz vs extension vs expansions). The meeting attendees is a mix of sellers (2-4 ppl), account directors (6-8 pp), executives (3-4 ppl) and bizops (finances, staffing and hr, 4-5 ppl). The data I present is available all the time via a live HubSpot dashboard I created with all necessary reports. So all these people have access to this material all the time but probably don't review it outside of this meeting.\n\n*I'd like to make my insights more actionable but there are many audiences, I'm almost not sure where to turn my insights.... I end up with a general \"here's what happening\" but struggle with how to make it more actionable (or..for whom it could be more actionable). I think I worry about the actual value add of what I (my team) is contributing to this meeting.*  \n\nDigging deeper in any area (for sellers, for account directors for execs) might take the whole group down a rabbit hole that's only useful for some.\n\nAny insights on:\n(a) what you see the value of what we're offering at this meeting is 'as-is' and/or what it could be with some tweaks\n(b) what I might add to my analysis/insights to be more actionable\n(c) who you would prioritize in in the insights\n\nThanks all!

If the stakeholders in this meeting want to get more indepth they will ask.\n\nAn example of too in the weeds might be:\n\u2022 Our pipeline forecast accuracy is down YoY because AEs are not setting close dates to early in the sales process. We will implement validations rules, create documentation around forecasting, and have managers spend more time reviewing their AEs pipeline.\nInstead I would do this:\n\u2022 Our pipeline accuracy is declining YoY and is due to X% of our current opportunities forecasted to closed X days faster than our current average sales cycle. We need to set expectations with AEs on forecasting appropriate close dates.\nThis meeting is a good opportunity for accountability across the go to market functions and an opportunity for you to showcase that you are critically thinking about what the metrics mean for the business.",

Not everyone is able to read patterns and anomalies either - so they won't get the same out of it that you do.\n\nThe insights I would point out in the meeting align with Matt. Focus is: where are we compared to where we should be this time of the quarter is key and where we are short. Sales tends to pay little attention to pipeline - it makes sense because they are focused on closing - but good sales managers will know it's critical to build now to close later.\n\nFor more nuanced observations, I'd go to each business unit leader and explain you want to learn how to provide more value and would like to have some dialog about what you see. This way it's more of an open conversation. I always made it clear to them that they have context I'm missing, but I'm also in the weeds with the data - so can offer a different perspective. Not everyone will take you up on it (which is their loss IMHO) but you'll learn a ton in these conversations and gain confidence. This will help flag what's important to everyone and worth raising in the larger setting eventually.",

Is there industry-specific messaging that you could roll out? Is there a new product that could create new leads? Should you review closed lost deals to see if you can bring any back into your sales cycle?\n\nAlot of that type of planning and action depends on how you segment your pipeline.\n\nIn terms of closing more, that can be more of a sales action, internally you could bring up a spiff program for example. Also, other ideas to close deals faster could be discounting, trials, proof of concepts, getting execs more involved in the sales motion, asking a more senior AE to help out a junior AE etc.\n\nLong story short, I'd try to present ideas that partner with your marketing team to drive lead gen, and ideas partnering with your sales team to close more deals.",

We put together our sales strategy and plan this *knowing* we'd still need the old tactics. They make up about 30% of the plan (honestly, it will likely be higher but we're ambitious lol). The switch won't be automatic from a people or revenue perspective so we're just planning for it. Give the folks a solid transition plan!",

That all said, I have built a separate type of \"sales process status\" field on Opportunities to streamline actions that need to take place...instead of creating multiple reports for them:\n\nExample:\n\u2022 if Close Date < TODAY...Sales Process Status = \"fix close date\"\n\u2022 if Amount is still default value $ at Stage x...Sales Process Status = \"update amount\"\n\u2022 if Forecast Category = Pipeline and Close Date = This month...Sales Process Status = \"fix close date\"\n...etc etc sometimes multiple reasons can be present and you just need to think through how you want to display/report/action that. The nice thing about having actual values for these is that you can build more granular reporting and or escalations paths on actions that need to take place.",

Not sure what else is in your stack in terms of automation / matching / de-dupe, but worth vetting to make sure that if you have any tool that do Person to account matching or de-dupe, they can create ACRs\n\nSome of this can be combatted by adding and exposing more info on the ACR (which some of these tools can read) - but this definitely has the potential to be a gotcha. One other thing that most likely is critical to include - some concept of \u201crole\u201d or \u201crelationship\u201d a person may have one relationship with one biz, but a more supporting with a second biz.\n\nFrom a people lens - enablement is KEY - if you don\u2019t really really focus on enabling your end consumers of SF data (people directly engaging with the accounts &amp; contacts) to the benefits.

        "text": "Quick question in regards to marketing event attribution. We tie campaigns to contacts which are associated to opportunities which is how we evaluate campaign performance. This works pretty well, but with longer deal cycles we sometimes have trouble waiting the 1+ years it takes for a deal to close to see the closed won ARR actually come in.\n\nContacts are associated perpetually to a campaign so we often have marketing wanted to claim credit for deals that came in long after any interaction with one of their marketing campaigns. Is there a typical window people are using to associate opportunities to a campaign? I\u2019ve proposed 30 days prior to campaign (from pre-event reach out efforts) and up to 4 months after the campaign based on the data I\u2019ve seen. Does anyone have something that\u2019s worked better or additional insights? TIA!",

For example, events could have a longer attribution window and be goaled on influenced closed/won deal count/$. SEM ads could have a tighter attribution window and have a goal of demos or qualified opportunities. Group the channels based on the stage of funnel they should drive, and align with the marketing team on the appropriate attribution window for these. It's not perfect, there are more scientific ways of doing it, but sometimes going from 0 to 1 is just as valuable as going from 1 to 100.",

We recognize these opportunities as sourced by the campaign and we can just stamp them and monitor closed won as they come in from that opportunity creation cohort.

If it\u2019s a current client you should have the AE or CSM reach out to initiate the survey for the product team or who will handle it. Depending on the relationship between your reps/csms and current/former clients you will definitely get friction/encouragement from the sales team.

There were certain blockers we had at the time like no SOC2 and another huge one was we didn't even have SSO to offer our clients, those aren't impossible to get around and if you aren't targeting finance, legal, and HR companies you should be okay to get around those blockers. The issue wasn't the product as a rep from that company is was really a sales issue and product was confused why they prioritized certain features in the past but enterprise deals still weren't closing. Product was going crazy and it wasn't because of the product and the features they updated/added it was a sales process issue. The lack of knowledge in the sales team led to deals being lost and product was able to find that out from talking to clients that were paying for our best features that would save them hours but no one had made them aware. We were a small start-up so our CSM/onboarding was unfortunately very hard to cover for the technical product it was.",

Was trying to come up with a good metric for the state of their sales processes (oppty stages) and came up with this KPI:\n\nProcess Utilization (%) = Average Number of Stage Changes for Won Deals / Available Stages\n\nI've been asking other ops and admin friends on if they could gather this number for their org so I can get a good discipline wide baseline to compare. Would anyone here by willing to contribute the study?\n\nSome data I've gathered so far (companies anonymized):\n$6B B2B Consulting firm: 88%\n$300M B2B Consulting firm: 31%\n$9B B2C Products / B2B wholesale company: 80%\n$15M B2B Products/Tech company: 46%\n$11B B2C Products/ B2B Tech Company: 65%\n\nPS: If you are interested in how to create a report to get this out of your SFDC org, here is how I and others been doing it:\n\n1. Create an Opportunity History Report\n\n2. Create a row grouping of \"Won\"\n\n3. Create a Summary formula with the following:\nName: Number of Stage Changes\nOutput: 1 Decimal Number\nFormula: RowCount/OPPORTUNITY_ID:UNIQUE\n\n4. Add your org's equivalent of the following filters:\nShow Me: All Opportunities\nOpportunity Close Date: Last 120 Days (or wtvr recency you think makes sense)\nInclude: Closed\nOpportunity Record Type: not Renewal (we have cross sells/new/upsells)\nTo Stage: not equal to Closed Lost, Closed Won\nStage Change: equals True\n\n5. Hide Details from your table\n\nUse the number from the Won= True group, and divide by your total number of stages (not incl won/lost)\n\nExample screens attached",

Our BDR team recently moved off it  from Salesloft and we're are having trouble restricting net new account creation from Apollo. If you have solved a similar issue please read on and LMK your thoughts! :pray:\n\nRequirement:\nWe are prospecting to a predefined TAM and want to push new contacts from Apollo to Salesforce without pushing any net new accounts to Salesforce. I.e. only new contacts on existing Salesforce accounts are of interest.\n\nConstraints:\nWithin Apollo it is possible to toggle off pushing new accounts to Salesforce. However, this does not completely prevent account creation from Apollo to Salesforce. Reason being when you push new contacts to Salesforce if the account does not exist in Salesforce, Apollo will create it regardless of the push new accounts to Salesforce settings.\n\nAttempted Solution:\nI was advised in implementation that I could created a validation rule in Salesforce preventing account creation except via lead convert. However, in practice this is causing intermittent unexpected sync errors when trying to push contacts to existing Salesforce accounts. I have raised with Apollo but they are struggling to provide a solution.\n\nIf you have solved this issue please LMK how you did it! Thank you!",

But First touch includes response activity with the Contact at any level. This means the contact has responded and or engaged with clear line it was from a marketing campaign or person.

For example, we have an AE who will be going out on maternity leave in June. She will be out all of Q3 and likely some of Q4. We want to put language into the commission plans that addresses these type of scenarios. Our AEs have annual quotas and also quarterly quotas (not evenly divided by quarter). And how are commission splits handled, if for example, the AE started the deal but then went out on leave before it was closed so another AE took over? Would appreciate your best practices and examples. Thank you.",

Are you using a tool right now to auto-convert and route?\n\nAll I can tell you is my own experience:\nAt my previous company, we had a contact\u2019s only crm, but it caused issues with matching and routing. Some tools are much better with matching when it\u2019s a lead to account, rather than a contact to account.\n\nBut it all depends on your Sales Process. Do you have a team of SDR\u2019s/BDR\u2019s that need to vet a lead before giving it to an AE?\n\nAnd creating personal Accounts, or even a holding account, is also an issue we were dealing with at my last company and why we moved to using Leads.",

Right now we need to either look at 2 reports in salesforce, one for leads and one for contacts or move to a BI tool and join the tables in order to get the full picture.

For example, if you have stages with loose qualification early on, you will likely see a low win rate since you are going for \"At Bats\" vs. optimizing your sales resources to revenue. You can also use it as a diagnostic for velocity if you look at deals generated by month by stage (eventually, all deals should either be won/lost so you can see deals dragging)\n\nI have measured Won/Lost as more of a forecasting tool since you are looking at outcomes for a given period without factoring in time to close.  This tends to play better with leadership as there is less context to account for, but you end up digging into the above view to understand what's happening. (How many deals have we generated, how quickly are they closing, and how many deals are won after we have done a demo? ect ect)\n\nHope this helps.",

        "text": "So I think it\u2019s a lot easier conceptually than it is practically. And a lot more useful conceptually than practically. First of all, how do you define CRM hygiene? There are a lot of different components to \u201cgood\u201d data in a sales role, and listing all of them in one clause would get unwieldy. Something like requiring all Deals to be inputted into the CRM to get paid is more doable, but that\u2019s only a small part of the adoption equation. It\u2019d be a decent stopgap measure if there was an issue of multiple Deals straight up not existing in the CRM, but it wouldn\u2019t solve for the overall problem which is low adoption/utilization. \n\nBut then you have the unintended side effects . There is a very real risk that tying pay into administrative functions (depending on how substantial) will cause a noticeable decrease in the time reps are spent selling. Obviously that is not an ideal outcome. \n\nThen there\u2019s the possibility that if you get too granular, people will find ways to circumvent processes and do what they want anyway. Which worst-case-scenario could end in completely inaccurate data you don\u2019t even realize is inaccurate. If you require properties X Y and Z to be filled out to get commission, what\u2019s stopping someone from theoretically just putting in whatever\u2019s fastest? How would you even know if something like that happened? I remember hearing a story about an org in which call time was one of the primary sales KPIs. Instead of resulting in longer, more thorough sales calls, the reps just called phone trees and 1800 numbers. \n\nMy LinkedIn friend Nick wrote a great post on the subject a few days ago actually: <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-bryner_salesforce-activity-7159633772856958976-HiuX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios|https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-bryner_salesforce-activity-7159633772856958976-HiuX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios>\n\nTL;DR: In a limited capacity, policies like this might be able to alleviate serious, immediate concerns with data hygiene (keyword is might). But as a long-term way to drive adoption, my opinion is that it\u2019s too complicated and not effective enough to be viable. ",

Now you know who to tag when you're ready for a team plan:grin: (:heavy_plus_sign:Absolutely agree on the even credit due whether target account or not)\n\nIn my scenario here, ABM/ABS applies on Outbound &amp; Inbound(routing), and I'm more so exploring the comp incentive differentiation via level of inbound intent, so \"you're rewarded for that increased effort engaging &amp; driving a meeting with someone who would have otherwise still been in a TOF awareness level.\"\n\nMy proposed _why_ stems from seeing mktg teams over time struggle to accurately say 'Event A was better than Event B' because SDR teams didn't feel fired up to 'work that massive attendee list' of lower intent leads as part of the integrated campaign play. SDR feedback loop was often around the fact that they were comped the exact same as decision/purchase stage handraisers. So the results of 'Event A vs Event B' in #attributed meetings or $pipeline volume ends up more like apples-to-oranges.\n\nAnyways that's where my thoughts have taken me thus far, will share some interesting scoops if I end up launching an experiment in the near term!\n\n<@Ua0e35b9> Dogs, leaf blowers, Bart trains, you name it! It's actually free so totally recommend you give it a whirl and let me know what you think:ok_hand: Intent tooling exploration likely 2H for me, glad to learn about <@U36fab25>'s solution though.\n\n<@Ud37c1cb> Agree on that immediate warm actioning! I've experimented at another company with fully automating highest-intent/warm IB straight to AE calendars and we saw a (form submit-to-meeting scheduled) jump around ~12-15%. But to your point about that _*sometimes_ higher quality, I think there is still value in SDR IB qualification so (meeting held-to-opp created) C% doesn't tank and time isn't wasted. In this thread's scenario, I'm pondering if a flat monthly/quarterly SLA $kicker suffices to cover Warm-IB. So team is technically comped much less there vs Cold-IB or OB, but they earn guaranteed $ if they properly qualify the hand raisers within \"# bus. hour(s)\" for example. Unsure if that's enough risk mitigation against our warmest IB waiting too long though.",

Currently, our reps create opportunities on the partner account itself, but this disrupts our pipeline creation metrics, which they're measured on. The partner team suggests creating 'dummy accounts' that will be updated later, but there's concern these may never get updated. Any thoughts or alternative solutions?\n2. *Ownership:* Who should own the opportunities? Currently, the opportunities are managed by a specific MSP team, but they're under the ownership of the regional new logo rep. This setup is mainly for regional forecasting, and the reps receive quota credit on the deals despite minimal involvement. Any advice on how to streamline ownership and ensure accurate attribution?\n3. *Parent Account IPs:* Has anyone dealt with selling to MSPs in IP blocks? For instance, they may purchase 1 million IPs per year with a goal to increase that block year over year. They have autonomy over how they allocate the IPs, and we may lack insight into that. Any experiences or strategies to share?\n",

Assuming annual terms, 30,60,90 day out clauses are not common in SaaS for several reasons:\n\u2022 potential clawback and/or delay of sales credit and commissions for any cust opts out, which sales hates.\n\u2022 you have to delay revenue recognition (close won --&gt; close lost) or accept the churn, which finance and CS both hate. \n\u2022 These are the top 2 I know about, and there are probably more.\nIf the product is able to be implemented in a fast time period where a 30,60,90 out would provide ample time to evaluate, I think companies typically try to figure out how to offer a paid or free trial, POC, or sandbox.  Or, they have the brand recognition to not need a trail or opt-out.\n\nAs an aside, paid trial and opt-out are basically just semantics, but I think it makes it easier for the business to set up separate processes, commissions, etc. so they are handled differently.\n\nHope this helps!",

With a custom object, you are also able to create custom fields, validation rules, &amp; use flow automation to create new records on a cadence. Example: every 3 months, create a custom QBR record and notify the owner that it's due in 7 days.",

Small scale relative to number of companies detected in the same window but still, great for precision.\n\nHere's a breakdown I just posted of intent data: <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/evanpdunn_3rd-vs-2nd-vs-1st-party-intent-whose-side-activity-7162879551021252609-nzDt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop|https://www.linkedin.com/posts/evanpdunn_3rd-vs-2nd-vs-1st-party-intent-whose-side-ac[\u2026]551021252609-nzDt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop>\n\nI think the future of 1st party intent is twofold:\n1. buy both company level and contact level - the former for coverage (Clearbit, 6sense, etc.) the latter for precision of follow up. Follow ups on company level data work great, as evidenced by quite a few tests, but always good to cover what individuals you can.\n    a. If you do get a contact level provider (<http://Customers.AI|Customers.AI>, <http://Retention.com|Retention.com>, SimplyIntel, Leadfeeder are all working on offerings here) then recommend piping it through <http://Clay.com|Clay.com> so that if a contact doesn't have an ICP title or ICP company (this is a complex table to build, haven't done it yet), then find someone else with the same last name in the same city/geo and check for ICP title and ICP company.\n2. buy an engagement layer. We call this an \"<https://www.linkedin.com/posts/evanpdunn_what-is-allbound-first-video-in-a-while-activity-7161462299772239872-8v00?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop|allbound\" platform>. - you need a way to engage these 1st party intent sources with sales. Not just retargeting for ads (don't need a tool for that anyway just a pixel, or a series of pixels), but sales engagement on-site with chat, and follow-up via sequences.\n\nTo your q - market leader on 1st party intent for a long time has been Clearbit Reveal. Some niches consider Leadfeeder the leader. But it's still very much up in the air as evidenced by this new wave of 1st party intent _sources_ and _engagement_ platforms.",

This part is all working fine.\n\nWe are reporting on this by week and the issue I am having is creating Salesforce reports that allows for weeks where there has been no contribution to the target to still show, and not just be removed from the report entirely.

Recycled Reason = Lost - Budget OR Competitor OR whatever you want your lost reason to be\n3. Good fit, not ready to buy\n    a. MQL &gt; SQL &gt; Recycled\n        i. Timeframe (number field in Months)\n            1. You could have another formula field that takes the recycled date + timeframe and that gives the date to put it back in the funnel\n        ii. Recycled Date\n        iii. Recycled Reason = Good Fit - Timing OR Budget OR whatever reason they are not ready\n4. Bad fit, never going to buy\n    a. MQL &gt; Disqualify\n        i. Disqualify Date\n        ii. Disqualify Reason (if you want) = Spam OR Not a fit OR whatever. \nIf leadership asks, \u201cHow many leads did we generate last quarter that are good fits, but don\u2019t have opportunities right now and why?\u201d Report can be, give me all MQLs generated last quarter, where recycled reason \u2260 NULL. On top of this you can give your sales team a report of contacts/accounts where the timeframe for follow up is in the next 90 days to start warming that account back up.\n\nAnyway hopefully this helps.",

The stages and probabilities should align to the assumptions in the operating plan for the fiscal year.  That would mean that you have conversion rates for each stage, as well as cycle times, to forecast when the opportunities convert to bookings.   Typically, you would work back from a cumulative conversion rate of ~25% for New, ~50-60% for Expansion, and at least 70% for a Renewal.  In addition to validating what is in the operating plan, I would suggest backtesting with the most recent 6-12 mos of data.  Doing that last bit of work will tell you where the greatest risk, or opportunity, in execution lies.\n\nOne key question I would have is this: Is the probability-weighted forecast going to be THE forecast the CRO or Head of Sales delivers to the CEO and CFO each week?  If not, then all of this work on stages and probabilities might be a somewhat futile effort.",

        "text": "I have never seen, in 18 years using salesforce the value in Probability based forecasting. Why.  because if you have clearly defined stages ( less than 10) and you consistently your track milestones along the way. As an opportunity moves up through the process and for example you get to a Proposal stage. You at that point know what the exact value is of the deal.  Sure the final negotiated price may change but you are still moving forward if you are negotiating and at a point where actual Terms/contracts' are under review, you will ether win or loose it.  In additional as you get the deals on the closing process your close date should get more accurate. Everything before a formal proposal has less than a 50% potential. But you can feed yourself on potential.  Have very well defined stages with expected milestones defined that are clear to the selling teams. as an example of they don't know who the signor or the signing process it can not be greater than a 50% stage value, not revenue value.  Over time you should be able to determine Win rate of created qualified Opps that are at least at a stage 1 or 2. Secondly you know what your average deal size is.  All qualified deals start there and then are adjusted through the process so by the time your at 50%-80% you should have a more  exact amount. Finally what your average closing time.  I've see all kinds of math gymnastics, my guide is Keep it simple consistent and Mange your team from the actual Opps in the CRM  with less voodoo guestimation. Its half art and half science  enjoy",

        "text": "I used to feel this same way, however I made a change to our weighted forecast amount formula and it has been very, very close to final results for the past few quarters.\n\nWhat I did was run historical win rates on count _by stage_ first, then historical win rates on amount by stage next, and lastly I ran the same thing with historical win rates by Forecast Category. To pull these reports, we had to have history tracking on the stage, forecast category, and amount fields.\n\nThen, I incorporated these rates into the end formula. I'll be honest, I didn't expect a much better result, because logically it just never made sense to me that we'd close 'x'% of the amount just because the deal got to a certain stage, but I've been single digits away from our finish several times now.\n\nI've also found it interesting that the forecast my VP of Sales has been submitting weekly is almost within a few percentage points off of the weighted forecast value. Now, I'll never just rely on this formula alone, but it's at least direction after going through the above process :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n*edit: Wanted to quickly clarify one thing, when I say 'win rates by stage,' I mean how many of our deals that got to stage 2 (for example) ended up going to closed won. Same thing for amount, then same thing for forecast category :bulb:",
