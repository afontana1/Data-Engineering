During upgrades, DealHub sets up new subscriptions and manages transitions and credits seamlessly.\n\n*Data Mirroring in Salesforce:* Salesforce acts as a mirror for subscription data from NetSuite, allowing DealHub to access the necessary info without any complex logic in Salesforce.\n\n*Data Quality Monitoring:* We use Snowflake to monitor data quality, ensuring consistency and accuracy across Salesforce and NetSuite.\n\n*Minimal Customization:* The focus in Salesforce is on data mirroring for subscription management, keeping customization to a minimum.\n\n*Self-Service Amendments:* DealHub allows customer-driven changes during subscription terms, facilitating an easier amendment process.\n\n*Subscription Management:* We handle upsell and downsell processes initiated in Salesforce, communicating these changes to NetSuite for subscription amendments.\n\n*NetSuite as Primary Record Keeper:* While Salesforce stores a mirrored version of subscription data, NetSuite remains the system of record.\n\nThis approach simplifies the integration process, maintaining data integrity and ease of use between Salesforce and NetSuite.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions or need more details <@U80d1dc9>!\n---End Of Response---",

What I can\u2019t say, is that Pardot is a rather clunky tool and if not properly done can generate more confusion, then help. I think HubSpot is still better as a marketing solution and this also means that you don\u2019t necessarily have to also get the CRM, you can have salesforce as your CRM and HubSpot, just for marketing. In your case, I think you should be fine going down this path.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nHubspot really is excellent but $$$$$ add up real fast once you want functionality.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nalso very true\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI have experience with both. The only note here is you might run into challenges with the HubSpot to SFDC sync in the future. I'm currently running on a two platform process and have experienced growing pains in processing data between platforms when processing 1,000+ records per hour. It has been slowing down our speed to lead automation, leading us to start investing in SFDC flow builds.

Pick Lists, Text, Dates, and Booleans transfer over nicely. You are also able to narrow the scope of field mappings so that you are able to manage scaling into the sync. We run on enterprise for both platforms and have been able to manage 90% monthly accuracy. What I can call out with enterprise is that the limit accepted by Salesforce is 1,500 API calls per 15 minutes which comes out to the ability to sync about 300 records in that 15 minute cycle.\n\nIn short, using both platforms isn't a challenge as long as your team is familiar with managing multiple integrations.\n\nIMO, I would let your team run with what they are comfortable with. One last recommendation, make sure to build a culture of documenting processes and workflows in both systems. It'll save you from growing pains down the line.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nHubspot over Pardot any day.\n\nI used to manage Pardot for Zoom and it was great for basic needs, but didn\u2019t scale well for the company.

We also have an internal database that stores all of the data we need to power our software. As a result, we have unique records in this database that represent the same accounts &amp; contacts that exist in Salesforce, a scenario I'm sure is common across software companies.\n\nWe're now at a point where we'd like each entity (a single account or a single contact) matched across systems so that we can start pulling data together between the two systems.\n\nA simple example would be to show me user engagement (internal DB) for our top 10 accounts by revenue (Salesforce). Right now, because we don't have a link across the two systems, we'd have to pull a quick report in Salesforce to see the top accounts, then build a report in AWS Quicksight and manually select those accounts. I think what we need is a way to maintain a table of IDs across these 2 systems (and any others we want to include), dump all the data we need from both systems into AWS, then build combined reports insight of Quicksight.\n\nWould love to chat to anyone with strong recommendations or insights on this topic. Thanks in advance!\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI've done this a couple of times. Have you looked at Syncari?

I have done months of research on this and this cannot be solved without tools like Celigo. Even with Celigo it's not super duper easy, and pretty expensive. The way I handled this, at the end, was to use a combination of tools like Metabase, Coefficient, Zapier, etc. and make patches, reports wherever possible, and fix stuff manually.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nThe other option is to build something. I've built something similar using Python and GCP\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYou could use the Simple-Salesforce package in Python.

If you go forward make sure you have a good roadmap created with buy-in from engineering.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nGot it. Let's just say 5,000 rows in AWS. Then 20,000 rows in SFDC. That's a fairly small lift which can be done with a custom Python script.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nHow are you matching the accounts between your databases? Domain?

Are they going to be exact key pairs or do you have to fuzzy match?\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nAt a previous startup I built this from scratch with Python. The only thing is that you're incurring technical debt and knowledge in a few people, therefore creating a single point of failure.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nWhat you could do is get the architecture up and running with a *build* offering. Prove the value of it and then develop a groundswell for getting a budget. I'd think you'd need $10K total for an ETL + DW setup. But if you add in a reverse ETL to the mix then you're looking at double or triple that depending on who you go with.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSo we have 2 different account types - corporate (representing companies) & buildings (representing physical locations). One of the issues is that there are a non-trivial amount of dupes (which probably needs to be solved first), so we need a manual way to correct any mismatches.\n\nI built a matching process that worked ok with Zapier, Sheets & Salesforce, but it's very brittle, error-prone, and is a pain to manage.\n\nI really like the idea of utilizing that Python library to build something that works well enough and then decide whether a tool is worth the cost later down the line.\n\nAll great suggestions, thanks <@U5eb4daf>\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nInteresting.

Then in the long run you can pump all that data out into a data warehouse for better visualization and reporting. \n\nIt gets muddied with a PLG model but still maintainable. \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI can connect you with someone on my team who knows how to connect AWS to Salesforce for this.

Then we have our own billing platform and NetSuite as our ERP and Sigma for BI.

I like having the RevOps process send the newly c/w account to the product for creation (and including the id there).\n\nIf you need your product data in your SF -- consider a Data Warehouse layer in between to manage that data flow.\n\nIf you don't have the bandwidth or the expertise to tackle any of these pieces -- let me know I can help.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nwe have a pipeline built in house that connects our warehouse and salesforce - using airflow (schedule the jobs) + python (send data through sf API) + dbt (create data models in our dwh) - all of them are open source.\n\nWe write daily to the account, contact and lead objects with info from admin. We have created several models in our warehouse that basically push the entire dwh table to the CRM (the column name in our ddbb = salesforce api endpoint), this way we don't need engineering work to add more fields into salesforce etc.\n\nwe just need to create the field in the SF object and add the new column in our dwh and it will be synced and pushed during the next pipeline run.\n\nFor leads and contacts we use the email field as key. For accounts we have an internal ID that match salesforce accounts to admin accounts.\n\nall these dwh models will be used to push info into other integrations as well, this way we ensure consistency of data across systems. \n---End Of Response---",

Are you able to share some examples how your company are registering Pilots under different record types? \n2. Next question is related to pipeline mgmt., - Do you agree to below process? \nIf a paid pilot is agreed, we will mark the \u201ccustomer\u201d as won with the tag \u201cPilot\u201d and register the bookings under lets said Pilot subscription.

I would add specific record types to the opportunity, record and account record with values for \u201cpilot\u201c and probably have to manually select this every time once one comes through. Reason is you might have difficulty automating this process given you don\u2019t necessarily know when Customer would like a pilot or not unless there is something you can automate already. Advantage of doing this as well is that you can create your own set of fields and layout for pilots as they usually require a specific process in itself and more easily segment when reporting.\n2. I do generally agree with this approach. The only thing I would ask you to think about is if you want that pilot opportunity to be marked as closed won already or left open Until the pilot actually completes. It really highly depends on your process here as I have seen customers do it both ways, but you should be fine either way. The advantage of leaving it open is that once it does actually convert into an opportunity you don\u2019t have to create another record and it might be easier to count conversions from stage to stage rather than record to record. On the other hand, you could still easily do that with some excel or SQL, and maybe even salesforce itself.\n---End Of Response---",

I recommend looking at the economics (OTE vs quota, # deals required at your average dealsize and # booked meetings required to hit target) to see if it\u2019s actually reasonable \n\u2022 in SMB and with high CAC, you won\u2019t be able to afford double paying. Suggest you set up an inbound sales office and give them 2-3x quotas\n\u2022 Give the SMB/mm reps a territory of 300 accounts that they can prospect into. Any inbounds outside those territories goes to the inbound sales team \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSounds like you\u2019re well on your way to having field sales established, just caution going big on this model until you\u2019ve reviewed marketing strategy and optimized.

Develop a GTM plan with reasonable assumptions, and then test those in a controlled manner, before committing significant $'s to the GTM motion.  For example, if you established a team of 10 SDRs to generate demand from the US, you might find that 2 of them have success with a particular customer profile and/or use case.  But the underperformance of the other 8 SDRs could mask where there is productivity from the 2 SDRs, and make everything look bad.\n---End Of Response---",

Thank you in advance!\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nWe're a ~$500M ARR business, moved to a segment model in 2023 combined with a major shift upmarket (General Business + Enterprise versus prior model more focused on Midmarket + SMB)\n\nIt's a huge change for any business, requires a ton of planning and thoughtful strategic alignment across the GTM teams.\n\nWe've seen positive results from the shift, but it's a work in progress for some of the GTM teams to evolve their strategy alongside the shift in sales resourcing (i.e. marketing)\n\nIn and of itself, moving to a segment based model with respect to sales resources + territories probably won't have a huge impact on your topline growth, the real catalyst is when each of the GTM teams have a strategy to optimize for each segment alongside.\n\nFor example,\n\u2022 an enterprise motion absolutely requires an ABX strategy - you can't just rely on regular course demandgen\n\u2022 You need to define your ICP and personas clearly, by segment, and develop the GTM playbook to sell into business according to their size/complexity and typical buying committee\n\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSuper helpful <@Ube100d5>!

That specific persona is very funded and more or less considered the domain expert in what they do. They didn't require a lot of cross-functional buy in from alternate departments to make a decision and we could often contract via established partner paper.  We didn't see the sales cycle become materially more complex (more buying partners at the table, very different planning cycles) until about 10K EE. When we saw this in our data a natural segment arose.\n\nEvery sales/product/buying group is unique and the goal is to crack where the data tells you the process changes and enable that vs. arbitrarily tiering.\n\nI would also say we didn't find that things like account plans or ABX were less important in MMKT - they were required - they just looked very different.\n\nI think we're largely saying the same thing!\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nDo keep in mind that skillsets of your sales resources might not translate well to different segments.

Basically one or two reps whose comp depends on upsells and cross sells. CS comp should be on retention / reducing churn. Sales comp should be on new deals.

Any advice would be much appreciated. :slightly_smiling_face:\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nThere are a lot of answers here. It really depends on which data you are keeping clean. For user inserted data I try to minimize the inputs to what I actually need to measure and give them the easiest means of writing said data as I can. You can validate truly needed fields but I would also create a clean your room dashboard for the rest. Automate every thing that isn\u2019t of key importance. Most of the time data entry issues are caused by there being too much of it.\n\nFor cpq fields like discounts and stuff I would focus on creating a highway, 90% of traffic should get through while only true outliers get flagged. For outliers have an established review process. The goal here should be to minimize the review and streamline. Again have a dashboard to track outliers.\n\nCreate a semimonthly data review meeting with leadership to go over where things are working and where they aren\u2019t. 30 minutes keep it tight, and just bring light to the dark places. \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nHey <@U5ae282b>\n\nSome quick tips to help with the noise and hygiene related to this:\n\n1.

Now that we  are working outbound, we need to change it to delimit who sales reps can reach out to.\nWhat we are doing is defining buckets :bucket: of countries per rep (evenly by TAM/customer base/inbound volume).\nOur idea is to use the ultimate parent account as criteria (we use ZI).

The way I have done this in the past is to look at Billing entity and buying center . Is entity you are selling to independent and different to the one you already have? Then its a new opportunity with a new account and contract. So VW automotive for example is one, porsche would be another but porsche might have a subdivision you might want to sell to. If that is the same as the billing entity you already sold to, I would class it as upsell. If the entity has a different billing and buying process, then I would class it as new\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nVery interesting, <@Ud9a555e>! Yes, we plan to have the sub-accounts with different countries.\nHow would handle if, say you get an inbound lead from Porsche Poland, and the Germany territory owner has been making outbound efforts with Porsche Germany?

Also billing entity does not mean you should consider that solely, the decision committee should also be different. If there are 2 different billing addresses but the same buying committee, then it should be considered as one, for example\n---End Of Response---",

Curious how other HubSpot users are achieving this.*\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI try to stay away from having multiple pipelines for different sales motions. The way I do this is by creating deals and properly assigning the source of each of them. So if it\u2019s an inbound lead, I assign the specific category of that inbound to the source and apply the same logic If it was outbound. this methodology avoids duplicates, and if you Add a workflow to timestamp each stage change. You are able to easily report on conversion rates.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI think for actual sales deals, we create deals a bit later than other companies. For the MQL stage of the journey, they have managed it with and like a pipeline.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nit acts independently of the sales deal that may come up later in a diff pipeline\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nDo you have Enterprise <@U45c5592>?\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nMQL pipeline could be an answer where you have less than 1000 leads. It does create the problem of adding another object in the mix - the deal object. I personally would not recommend it. I would say keep using the forms object, even though it doesn't have great native reporting in hubspot, using contact level conversion data and lifecycle stages is far better than tracking deals for each lead.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nCurrently lifecycle stage doesn't tell the sales team whether:\n\u2022 A demo request has been addressed\n\u2022 How many touches / is it progressing, etc.\nThey used to rely on the MQL pipeline to know things were working. When we started to stop (lol) supporting the MQL pipeline, they felt they lost a lot of that visibility. I am currently thinking about a custom object for MQLs lol. Because they really do want a pipeline view, but we have WAY too many deals floating around (because you can MQL more than once)\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYou can create your own custom lifecycle stages in Hubspot. I would say use those. When date of last booked meeting is known - move lead to \"demo request addressed\" stage. Touches is a direct property in Hubspot called \"Sales Activities\".\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U45c5592> If you have custom objects available, that's the way I would do it. You'll have more flexibility and scalability for reporting.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI'd have to get alignment from all stakeholders + RevOps team to be making changes to Lifecycle Stages, but yes this could be an option. We do already have some custom ones, but the problem is also that you can't view contacts on a board view, which would be a huge solve and necessary to complement the lifecycle stage change you're referring to I think.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U45c5592> - Since Custom Objects have a Pipeline, you can associate the newly MQLed contacts to a MQL Record and that can show up in the MQL pipeline, then when a demo meeting is associated, you can auto move them to the next stage, then demo created, etc. Most of it can be completely automated and visible to the sales team, with the added layer of reporting\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nIf you want to map it out and brainstorm, I'm totally game to assist\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYa we'd be essentially replicating the MQL deal pipeline in the custom object, I just wasn't sure if this was the exact same amount of overhead as supporting a deal pipeline haha\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI don't believe a deal pipeline is good practice for MQLs, but I'm more willing to support the overhead if it's a custom object and not a deal. Plus we could do a backfill of all historic MQL deals.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nExactly! Custom Object will give you the ultimate flexibility to remediate data and also protect the integrity. HubSpot's existing Lifecycle Stage infrastructure is not it. lol We have been using custom timestamps for a while now to tackle the MQL issue, but I'm at a point where I may do a separate Custom Object for all Lifecycle Stages in general.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYou can try custom objects, problems\n1.

Hubspot native stuff like activities don't sync on custom objects, you won't get a timeline view and that can be frustrating\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n1.

Activities linked to your contact won't sync onto the custom object level. That is the reason I don't rely on custom objects.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nGot it. I think that might be ok for these purposes cos we aren't looking to replicate the contact timeline on the MQL records, but we want to be able to create multiple MQL records for however many times they MQL, with custom fields as needed and reporting for create date etc.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nBecause our lifecycle stages only go forward, re-engaged MQLs is often a black hole\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nIt is doable, but a lot of work and iterations.

This is why we use custom conversion timestamp fields so this doesn't get wiped out. However, when it comes to combining lifecycle stage conversion with attribution, we are running into a lot of challenges using only custom fields. I'm thinking of using a Custom Object to report on conversion so we can have a record of each conversion, the source, the timestamps, and it's 100% flexible, can scale up or down with custom fields, has a pipeline for visualizing the movement, and can be utilized in cross-object reporting. This provides a much more robust method to what is natively in HubSpot and circumvents a lot of the challenges with data remediation.\n\nOf course, I use custom coded actions to do the associations between other objects such as tickets and deals, so that does become important. You can use other platforms such as Make, n8n, etc to do these as well, but it's more cost effective running those in the HubSpot platform. Maybe one day I'll make this into an app for the marketplace. lol\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nRough timeline for implementation would be around 2 months to finalize everything. There's a lot of upfront discovery at first to identify the scenarios and triggers for each Lifecycle Stage, and then there's testing and quality assurance.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nThank you! And when you say \"attribution\", do you mean in general or with HubSpot Attribution?\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nDefinitely not HubSpot Attribution, that's a broken system and when I worked at HS Elite & Diamond partner agencies, we steered away from using it. Also chatted with Aptitude8 and they even recommended using a custom object over HubSpot's native attribution system. We would use a custom attribution model that takes into consideration UTM parameters, engagements, activity, etc. and would copy that data into custom fields on a custom object when a contact hits each Lifecycle Stage. No we can't push the activity into the timeline (without a huge API lift), but we can trigger off from it on the contact and set fields on the custom objects.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nInterestingggg\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nWe have been tempted to go down the native attribution path several times but I always remember stuff like this people say to me\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nThe other option is using a Data Warehouse and a BI tool instead which is what I'm also exploring but this has a much higher technical requirement.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI really think we need to fix attribution. Doing custom objects for all lifecycle stages and not just MQLs tho - that seems like it would be kiiiind of messy in the contacts menu too tho maybe? Small thing but :thinking_face:\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYou don't need to show everyone :wink: Keep it to your RevOps Team for audits. People will see the output in Report.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nCustomize those views for your teams. Saves a heck of a lot of cognitive load. Only show 'em what they need.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nHonestly what I would do is, don't create a new lifecycle stage record for MQL as an example on a contact. Use the same one, but update it. Use the original create date as the original MQL date, and if they re-convert after closed lost, you can have a field that updates and says when they re-MQLed.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nhmm yeah but we need to see the total number and type over time\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nso there has to be an 'entity' for every instance of an MQL, whether new or re-engaged\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYep, you can run it that way too. Only issue is when you want to see a timeline style report of contacts converting from stage to stage over time. Because the other MQL entities may cause duplication. But you could resolve that by pushing the most recent and first created MQL date to the contact in custom fields so you could report on either of those timestamps.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nthe lifecycle stage does do that alone I think, let us see the overall conversion, but I'm getting a bit confused now cos of coming back to MQL from lets say, having ghosted pipeline the past perhaps, you become re-engaged\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSo we can easily track straightforward conversions that take a normal lifecycle path, but we also want to track and address those contacts that are popping back up engaged again\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI would use the custom lifecycle stage timestamps set by the custom object to determine the lifecycle stage conversion overall, simply because the native Lifecycle Stage timestamps and automations are garbage.\n\nThen you can use the custom object for MQL reconversion reporting.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI'm literally thinking through all of this as we speak, so thank you! You're helping identify some key considerations\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nbut with the custom objects, can do you a proper conversion funnel, for reporting?\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nor would it be reporting formulas?\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYou could use calculation field which has a counter option on the contact to count the number of MQL records on the contact, then simply make the report say, if Number of MQLs is known, and use Count of Contacts to show the amount of contacts that have a MQL record. Then you can use the calculated field to report on how many times a contact reconverted as well. For any conversion funnel reporting, it has to be a 1-1, so contact to lifecycle stage with 1 timestamp for the funnel reporting. For simply understanding number of conversions, you can use the custom object for more advanced understanding of when reconversion happened and how many times and what source, etc.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYeah, whenever your criteria is met just increase count by one, except the first time. That would create a reengaged counter for ya!\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nIf you take a crawl, walk, run apprach:\n1. Crawl - Use a counter to measure number of times a MQL reconverted. (Can't measure time when it occurred. Can only update the timestamp field.)\n2. Walk - Use a custom object to log when a contact hits certain Lifecycle Stages based on activity. (More flexible to measure re-conversion/source/historical timeline.)\n3. Run - Use a data warehouse and BI tool to derive insights using AI such as ThoughtSpot to answer these questions.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U9f71571> FYI\n---End Of Response---",

Bottom of the Funnel (BOFU) - CS focused\nThen I would take those groupings and slot them into your framework that you mentioned above. I think it\u2019s a great way of approaching it, especially when starting from a greenfield.\n\nAlso, here\u2019s a good report that Iconiq Growth just publish on GTM Metrics and Reporting, if you wanna take a look: <https://www.datocms-assets.com/65181/1703006635-iconiq-analytics_gtm-reporting-guide_vf.pdf>.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nThanks to you both! <@U62b827f> <@Ud9a555e>.

Less? the same? Same but over a longer period? \n*Administering the change internally*\n1. Jeff highlighted some of the key items you'll need to think about. Delivery services could be based on % completion, when delivered, or linear over time of the engagement. Software is over the lifetime of the engagement. Partner products may be recognized gross or net of COGS (agent vs principal accounting)\n2. Are you administering this at a deal level? If so, do you lock FX rates or do they change? Does it matter if the deal is booked in HQ versus a subsidiary that has a functional currency different from your parent company? \n3. How do you account for writeoffs and bad debt provision accrual? What if something is written of and subsequently collected?\n4. When will accounting be hard closed on revenue monthly? How about at year end? Will this impact the lead time to take final revenue results and run them through the payroll calcs? \n5. Do unbilled accruals impact revenue for ICs?\n6.

You could 'hack' a revenue calculation in the CRM as a proxy, but it won't directly reconcile to the revenue number your accounting team comes up with. Is the ELT OK with that?

Consider how to best work with your specific sales team. Do the reps really want a long how-to handbook or do they want sharing of how others do it, what makes some successful at CRM and others not. \n\nLast point, consider a looser term like a framework/playbook, similar to the checklist comments. Your CRM will adapt over time so you need something that is flexible and easy to digest to get a single answer. My sales team prefers the term playbook as it implies less intense \u201cdo it this way\u201d but \u201cthese are the best practices\u201d\n\nOtherwise, definitely take it chunk by chunk and get buy-in along the way (from sales leaders, SDRs, AEs) so you know you\u2019re on the right track before a larger roll-out \n\nGood luck!!\n---End Of Response---",

If the company has been going for a couple years you can identify this through looking at the overall customer base and identifying common threads to develop your ICP, but if the company is just getting started, it may be a bit more tricky and may take further consulting to determine the right firmographics.\n\nWe can also make some assumptions as well if the company is just getting started based on available resources and research. Typically companies with a greater chance of loan repayment have common attributes that speak to their overall financial stability.\n\nSo you're looking for companies that have a lower amount of employees (5-50 employees), with greater longevity (company started 5-10 yrs ago vs 1-4 years ago), and higher annual revenue ($5M+), and also look for industries that typically have more stable financials (Healthcare, Accommodations, Agriculture).\n\nYou can use <https://www.apollo.io/|Apollo >to source companies and leads for the above scenario.\n\nThere's a great article on Forbes about this topic: <https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-loans/small-business-loan-statistics/>\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nGold, <@U86db328>.

    "4b1c0c42-eb81-45e3-a5ae-3617bb575e7e": "# Start Parent Conversation\nHey all - I have a question regarding Lifecycle Stages. Currently, when a new contact is added to a Company who is a current customer of ours (Lifecycle Stage = Customer), we have an automation that moves them through automatically through all of the lifecycle stages (from Subscriber to Customer) since we want to be able to identify that they're already a customer.\n\nHowever, this messes up our reporting since it can sometimes inflate our MQL / SQL numbers and also looks odd in funnel reporting since it looks like they moved through the lifecycle super quickly. Would it be best to skip all of the previous lifecycle stages and go straight to customer in this case? Has anyone dealt with a similar scenario in the past?\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nAre you using HubSpot?\n\nWhy not skip the MQL step? If the contact hasn't been marketing qualified via engagements in the CRM, then it doesn't need to hit this stage.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI think it depends on how you use this and whether you're looking to upsell the customer or expand into new areas of the business.\n\nIf that's irrelevant, I'd skip the flow or create a way block for those in reporting (anyone added in the last day, etc. who now is Lifecycle=Customer).\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U86db328> interesting thought - that might actually be a good idea. Would you consider just skipping the MQL step as opposed to all the other steps? And yes, Hubspot.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U6ed78ea> thanks! We would use other properties to identify those that are opptys for expansions/cross-sells so that wouldn't be a consideration for this specific scenario.\n\nThat could also be a good idea :bulb:\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nIn short...yes, I would skip any stage that is not relevant for that contact. Use operating definitions for the MQLs and SQLs. If the contact doesn't meet that criteria, they shouldn't have touched the stage in the CRM.\n\nI'd even say the same thing with Lead. If they never became a Lead via conversion on a form and sales never pursued them, then they should also not be a lead. Not every contact associated to a company has to be in the LS flow.\n\nAs you probably are finding out, HubSpot's native lifecycle stage infrastructure is not optimal. I've worked for both Elite and Diamond HubSpot partner agencies specifically as a developer and consultant and ran into LS challenges often.\n\nHow I  circumvent the issues:\n1. Use custom timestamp properties and lock adjustments to Super Admins.\n2. Turn of all native LS automations.\n3. Use customer journey report vs funnels (funnels require that contacts have touched either all or the starting stage so it removes a lot of contacts from the reporting.)\nThe customer journey reporting shows me the dropoff, and conversion from stage to stage but it's not required that contacts have touched every stage.\n\nAlso, I'm more interested in Lead to C/W conversion on the RevOps side.\n\nHow many leads did either marketing or sales generate, did they convert to a demo (if in SaaS), then opportunity, then did they close. We don't care about the other contacts in the CRM right. We care about accurate conversion. So be very picky on who you include in your LS funnel reports.\n\nQuality over quantity,\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nOne more approach that we are using:\nLifeCycle Stages - We are just keeping it for account level and have  Prospect Account, Opportunity, Closed Won, Evangelist, Others\n\nTo track Contact's stage we are using Lead Status with the following values:\nLead/Prospect, MQL, In-discussion, SQL, Disqualified, Unqualified, Nurture, etc\n\nThis way we can have lead to C/W as well as account to C/W tracked\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@Ua2b5ddf> - You got me thinking. The new Leads object essentially could do this as well.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nReally interesting insights and food for thought <@Ua2b5ddf> <@U86db328>!!\n\nFunny enough, I actually went down this path and did some discovery earlier back (<https://revopscoop.slack.com/archives/C01BJNMEXPW/p1702559782238069|post here>) regarding the new Leads object, but ultimately found that it currently isn't yet built out enough to do support what our team would need for it.

But in the last 2-3 years i've been using deal stages to do my reporting. I've assigned MQL, SQL, and Opp lifecycle stages to specific deal stage. Deals get created immediately after someone requests a demo and if they fit our ICP criteria and they automatically become an MQL. I have tight definition for what counts as an MQL so it has helped keep our MQL -&gt; Closed Won conversions healthy.\n\nWhen someone from an existing customer account fills a form, they're automatically marked as a customer like in your situation. But this doesn't mess up my reporting since I track at a deal level.\n\nSide benefit I've experienced: Sales and marketing team are more aligned\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@Ua99fb60> I was thinking about that setup for a Customer. 2 questions:\n\u2022 Did you create a different Pipeline to manage all the Pre-sales stages (Lead to SQL) ?\n\u2022 The customer thinks about doing this on a Custom Object (which I am not a fan of). Do you have any strong views?\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U4ab23b9> we've intentionally kept it as simple as possible and didn't want to complicate it by creating different pipelines. our thought process was - we need to track deal stages and work out plans if things aren't going as planned irrespective of who sourced it. the more pipelines/custom objects we added, the more complex it would get.\n\nhowever, we did add a deal property to differentiate b/w inbound leads vs outbound. but this is used purely for reporting.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@Ua99fb60>'s solution is really smart and that's what I also set up for my clients, meaning that the lifecycle stages are tied to deal stages.\n\nAbout <@U4ab23b9>'s question:\nApart from some exceptions, I wouldn't start the pipeline earlier than SQL (but rather at opportunity), especially if you might get a lot of irrelevant demo bookings / contact requests. The reason is that you might fill up your pipeline with low quality leads, you'll have a low win rate and sales might be annoyed. (Not roasting <@Ua99fb60>'s solution - if it works for you, it works :blush:).\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI'd skip the custom object - <https://knowledge.hubspot.com/prospecting/set-up-leads|HubSpot has introduced a new Lead object> which is used exactly for the pre-deal life of a lead. I'd either use this, or leave it as a contact/company, and set up workflows to mark their lifecycle stages. This was you can make a funnel report for the whole lifecycle, but your pipeline is more manageable.\n---End Of Response---",

I\u2019ve always used it as a prediction of how much revenue can I expect out of the current qualified pipeline per day or month. So separating each piece of the equation into what\u2019s open vs what historical metrics can help inform what will happen to what is open is how I view it.  You can determine how much revenue was brought in over a historical time period based on closed deals, which is why I don\u2019t like to use closed & open deals in the first part of the equation. It\u2019s a known historical entity.  With this formula you\u2019re trying to forecast out what will happen based on your current open pipe \n\n(Num qualified open deals * avg historical deal size * win rate) / (historical days to close post qualification) \n\nThe historical deal size, win rate, and time to close should all be calculated over the same time period\n\nThere are also a bunch of dependencies depending on your pipeline hygeine.  If you\u2019ve got a bunch of aged deals that reps refuse to close and are going no where it will swing this number.  You may want to build in exclusions for aged open deals.

If you have a low sales velocity, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you have an underperforming sales team, it could mean you have an understaffed sales team.

If yes, why so?\n\nIf I have a pipeline of 100 deals, 20 lost, 30 won, 50 open, the conversion rate would be 30/100=30%, while the win rate is 30/50=60%. Isn't it misleading to use 30% for the prediction? :sweat_smile: If your deals typically close at a 60%, why not use that?

This was helpful because when we sent out notifications based on if an opp had no activity in last X days, a lot of times we heard from the rep that it\u2019s because they asked us to circle back 3 weeks later and they still had time.

I tend to not allow reps into a any stage without meeting qualifications of that stage. So typically the only time a rep would need to go back is due to a mistake.\n\nWith your time stamps you could allow for this in a flow, where the logic would be something like if previous stage #> updated to stage # then take and remove all values for time stamps fields of updated stage # and grater. Then it would clean the slate in terms of your time stamp fields as if they didn\u2019t happen. \n\nHowever I feel this is too much work and if this is to solve a one off problem it\u2019s not worth the trouble it might cause\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nAs much as opportunities are not linear, part of the idea of having a structured sales motion is to drive some predictability so if you can move in both directions, it kind of defeats the purpose.

There's some value in being able to start back to the consensus building process if you're further along. Another use case is introducing new products mid-cycle or there being some new technical consideration that pops up that requires re-validation.\n\nNow all that being said, the keep it simple stupid approach here is: if an AE wants to go back a stage, they can always close the existing opp and create a new one\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI literally was just about to say that as I was reading through your message <@U6a8de49>\n\nBased on rules of engagement and operating definitions agreed on by the sales team, technically they should set the opp to closed lost after a certain time frame. It's better to close it sooner rather than later to protect the deal velocity. Also if there's no next steps in place within the next 14-30 days, that's another sign of a lack in the pipeline management process.

Because of these factors, we decided to only allow our sales rep to update forecast category to reflect real-time deal dynamic at the moment and helps identify when a deal might require the escalation to leadership, especially when there is a sudden drop in the forecast. \n\nI am not against moving stage back at all, I think it\u2019s a dynamic decision that needs to be made depends on each company\u2019s sales cycle and KPIs. \n---End Of Response---",

My company is currently in the process of changing the way how we approach our ownership / management of systems (Salesforce etc.). Until now we have a very decentralized setup where each department owns and administrates their department processes within Salesforce (and other tools). However, the goal is to move to a more centralized or hybrid structure in the future because we have seen that the very decentral approach used to work when we were a smaller company but now with &gt; 2000 employees it\u00b4s reaching it\u00b4s limits.\nDo we have experts here who can share recommendations arounds best practices for the future setup?

Depending on how large the org is, a matrix structure may be of interest here. Teams form the columns and processes form the rows. This helps align knowledge and impact that processes and teams may have on one another across sales, marketing, CS etc. This also forms a somewhat unofficial change management practice, as those people will be aware of dependencies and alignments across their respective teams, processes, and tools. Happy to chat more if needed!\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI have worked at both, large and small companies and, as much as I would love RevOps to own the entire tech stack, thats just not a good idea. We have usually good knowledge of the front-end systems but not the back-end like DW, Azure, GCP, servers, etc. This leads to even more fragmentation so what I have done in the past is centralise it all under IT. Yes, sounds creepy but it ends up being the team with most holistic knowledge to manage it all under the same roof\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nIn short, from my perspective, it depends.  With regard to Salesforce specifically, the use case is important.  If it has grown to becoming a shared resource, then it should likely be centralized with RevOps being an internal customer of the team managing systems.\n\nThis would necessitate much more deliberate planning and communication between the teams as you could imagine.

The folks that do that are dedicated technology professionals who can attract, organize, and inspire the caliber of people needed to deliver at that scale.\n\nHappy to chat more if you're interested, <@Uc185c71>\n---End Of Response---",

Our Salesforce system integrates with tools like 6Sense, Apollo, LinkedIn, and Google Calendar. However, we're *facing challenges with duplicate activity records in SFDC*, leading to inaccuracies in account activity tracking.

If you don\u2019t know where the duplicates are coming from, you should start here to see if it\u2019s multiple tools or in fact one. If it\u2019s just one tool, then maybe shared activities solves the problem! If it\u2019s multiple, then you\u2019ll want to investigate those tools to turn off activity syncing.\n3. If you want to invest time in cleaning up historical duplicate activity data, just know it will be very manual. You could probably take a first pass at matching: assigned, date, subject, description. But you\u2019re going to need to be careful about the \u201cRelated To\u201d field because some records could look like dupes, but the same activity was logged to multiple contacts\n4.

Who your ICP is, who your personas are, what your engagement channels are, there\u2019s a long list but SalesLoft, Outreach and other sales engagement solutions have some good content on these best practice. I\u2019d just be cautious since a lot has changed in the last couple years\u2026now it\u2019s all about less activity, multi-channel and with as much personalization as possible over volume.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see if anyone else has good insight here!\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nJason, thank you so much for this detailed perspective on both the questions.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI have shared #1 with my leadership team and we will be sure to follow your advice on that.

If you focus the GTM org on accounts that have the highest lifetime value while taking into account the cost to land a customer of that type, that's how you optimize your GTM motion. Applies equally to marketing as it does sales and BD.\n\n*Execution:*\n\nStep 1: enrich your CRM with whatever data you can obtain with a reliable degree of accuracy:\n\u2022 Industry & subindustry\n\u2022 $ revenue & # employees\n\u2022 Country\n\u2022 Number of target personas at the company (from linkedin sales insights, for example)\n\u2022 Technographic info (from third party sites, CRM notes, call recordings, win/loss analysis)\n\u2022 Marketing engagement (website traffic, content downloads if gated, attendance of virtual or live events, etc)\nStep 2: To solve for LTV - do historical analysis on net retention and average landed dealsize based on various combinations of the above datapoints, and assign a score (out of 10 or 100, for example). We landed on scoring by segment, by industry (with separate score per segment), and by country (with separate score per segment.\n\nStep 3: Gather whatever CRM data you have available on historical opptys:\n\u2022 Win/loss rate\n\u2022 Number of touchpoints required to book first meeting\n\u2022 Number of meetings required to close the deal\n\u2022 level of internal support/resources required to close the deal\n\u2022 Level of marketing engagement. Was it an ABM account? How many pieces of content did they download? How many events did they attend pre/during the deal cycle?\nStep 4: To solve for CAC - evaluate how much effort is required to close opportunities per segment, industry, geography, possibly based on which persona you first made contact with, and assign a score (out of 10 or 100 for example)\n\nStep 5: optional - factor in intent scoring from a platform like 6sense or demandbase to account for companies that may not be a top scoring account but are high intent / decision or purchase stage\n\nStep 6: Decide which parameters you're ultimately going to use for account scoring, and what weights to attribute to each.\n\nStep 7: run the scoring model over your enriched account data, sync the scores to your CRM.\n\nStep 8: Build a workflow in the CRM to enable either revops/ops or sales FLMs to drop and add accounts at scale based on the score of existing rep territories versus the scoring that you cam up with from your model\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nOnce you come up with a scoring model, it's really important to consolidate the statistical insights into a digestible format that you can share with your GTM org - needs to become something that's assimilated culturally (\"our ICP is companies in X industry, with at least Y employees, in Z geos/countries\" - or whatever factors you end up including in your model)\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nImplemented this is my previous org. I think <@Ube100d5> has provided an extensive step by step answer to  your question, but in essence you want to rank accounts based on shortest time to close with highest probability to close and most revenue generated. If you are just starting out  and are in a time crunch(as we often are), I would recommend implementing a solution fast and then iterate after.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nThe question for you <@U6638872> would be is that if these accounts are prospect accounts( Not in current pipeline) then how would i rank them based on shortest time to close? Would i use win/loss analysis and try to work back words for those accounts to understand how much time they would need to close?\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nUsing win/loss analysis is one way. But the general rule of thumb is, if a customer is way farther along the customer journey and fits your ICP, it might be reasonable to assume that they can be closed sooner than others. For example, if multiple people  at the customer begin checking out your product and they do it frequently. Chances are they are at least seriously considering your product as opposed to just one person checking who is not even the target persona. Hope this makes sense.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U51f01a4> might be able to share more from his LinkedIn does it! (Back in my day verticalisation was a major focus)\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nMy team does this type of outbound with a scoring provided by our way of mircosegmenting accounts based on closeness to each other and then overlay customer accounts and score and tier prospect accounts that way.

Quick question,\n\u2022 We're currently dealing with an organization in 2 different regions, let's call them ABC UK and ABC US.\n\u2022 ABC UK &amp; ABC US both became our customers at separate points in time, with different stakeholders, contracts, billing cycles, plans, etc. associated with them. As such, we've been managing them as two entirely separate customers. \n\u2022 Now, after years, due to a change in their internal dynamics, they've decided to merge into one entity. They've cancelled the ABC UK contract and confirmed an upsell on the ABC US contract such that users that were previously under ABC UK can continue using the tool.\n\u2022 How would you manage the revenue from these customers? If we count ABC UK as churned and ABC US as upsold, it would impact our LTV calculations as well as our target setting for 2024, since it would throw off our forecasts. Any ideas on how we would solve for this?\nThanks in advance! :slightly_smiling_face:\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI usually reported on mergers and insolvency in separate ways specifically for that reason.

Hubspot does price with number of marketing contacts but most companies never need to use it as you get 1 million contacts free: <https://www.hubspot.com/pricing/marketing/enterprise?term=annual&amp;products=marketing-hub-professional_1>\n\nAlso, your deal stages needs to show subscriber, lead, MQL, SQL etc in order to capture marketing's effort.\n\nYou can probably get someone to work part time to show value (Nothing convinces management like a  bunch of leads that became Revenue) and then later hire a full time role.\n\nHowever, your biggest challenges is convincing old school sales folk to adapt to the new way of working.

A revops approach only works if it is embedded and you do this by making it their own idea. I would map out the entire process as is now (you will learn alot) and then start to pick off bits where the sales team would like things to be better\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@Udee0af1> I think there's also something to be said about uncovering underlying motivations if possible \u2014 for example, you had mentioned `The sales team is old school and resistant to any kind of change.` In your sales-intake form example, was the pushback because they felt like it would \"automate away\" their jobs? Or because they actually wanted to customize the email asking for more information? Or something else?\n\nFor example we're building a AI-enabled proposal automation platform (taking company information / pitch decks / prior proposals, and using it to help write a great first draft proposal automatically) and we're hyper-aware of some of the underlying motivations that users may have to our software (usually \u2014 \"will it take our jobs\", even if not explicitly said). We have to address this upfront and make it clear that it's an enabler instead of a replacer, and in fact will make their outcomes even better.\n\n_Generally_ speaking, most of the sales teams I've worked with (across being an investor, within the team, or with sales teams as customers) are primarily driven by desire to maximize sales and commissions, so to the extent that you are able to drive \"small wins\" and prove that it directly led to them making more money will certainly get them interested and bought in. That said this is definitely a longer process than being able to come in over the top and make large sweeping changes :disappointed:\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI've always found that using data as the foundation of the conversation can be a great neutralizing way of approaching things.

If not start doing that and set the expectations that the meeting will be used to discuss the key takeaways from this reporting cycle.\n\nWhen you send the pre-read highlight the top 5 takeaways and then prompt the group for their thoughts/feedback.\n\nWhen you present you can then restate the key takeaways and then ask for feedback on next steps. \n\nFor the takeaways I wouldn't get too in the weeds on the how, but instead focus on what impact it has in the business. If the stakeholders in this meeting want to get more indepth they will ask.\n\nAn example of too in the weeds might be:\n\u2022 Our pipeline forecast accuracy is down YoY because AEs are not setting close dates to early in the sales process. We will implement validations rules, create documentation around forecasting, and have managers spend more time reviewing their AEs pipeline.\nInstead I would do this:\n\u2022 Our pipeline accuracy is declining YoY and is due to X% of our current opportunities forecasted to closed X days faster than our current average sales cycle. We need to set expectations with AEs on forecasting appropriate close dates.\nThis meeting is a good opportunity for accountability across the go to market functions and an opportunity for you to showcase that you are critically thinking about what the metrics mean for the business.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI guess I would take a different approach. You're right, they aren't checking on things ahead of time. And even if you require them to, they probably won't. Not everyone is able to read patterns and anomalies either - so they won't get the same out of it that you do.\n\nThe insights I would point out in the meeting align with Matt. Focus is: where are we compared to where we should be this time of the quarter is key and where we are short. Sales tends to pay little attention to pipeline - it makes sense because they are focused on closing - but good sales managers will know it's critical to build now to close later.\n\nFor more nuanced observations, I'd go to each business unit leader and explain you want to learn how to provide more value and would like to have some dialog about what you see. This way it's more of an open conversation. I always made it clear to them that they have context I'm missing, but I'm also in the weeds with the data - so can offer a different perspective. Not everyone will take you up on it (which is their loss IMHO) but you'll learn a ton in these conversations and gain confidence. This will help flag what's important to everyone and worth raising in the larger setting eventually.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@Uf0208a8> - First it is fantastic question and goal.  There are so many best practices around this it can be confusing.\n1. I may have missed has there been established OKR/KPIs? If not, then this is must do organizationally. \n2. Do you have a visualization tool? Hubspot is great but sometimes the details which are needed are not easily shared and displayed\n3) Many times the same source of data is not enough to keep the different audiences fully engaged because of of needs. As you stated it \"general\" does not hit the spot.\n\n So it is best to segment reports to those groups focused on related KPIs, yes it is more to manage but now focuses.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI think a pre-read is a great first start and I agree that the time can be used to ask for feedback and start the discussion.\n\nTo me, the goal for pipeline is to 1. create more and 2. close as much as possible.\n\nWhen it comes to creating more you need to speak more of a marketing language, are there campaigns that worked in the past that you should consider restarting? Is there industry-specific messaging that you could roll out? Is there a new product that could create new leads? Should you review closed lost deals to see if you can bring any back into your sales cycle?\n\nAlot of that type of planning and action depends on how you segment your pipeline.\n\nIn terms of closing more, that can be more of a sales action, internally you could bring up a spiff program for example. Also, other ideas to close deals faster could be discounting, trials, proof of concepts, getting execs more involved in the sales motion, asking a more senior AE to help out a junior AE etc.\n\nLong story short, I'd try to present ideas that partner with your marketing team to drive lead gen, and ideas partnering with your sales team to close more deals.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U621962d> <@U7c45151> <@U38963e9> <@U9cbac36> - Thanks all for these speedy and thoughtful responses!!

I am about 3 years into my RevOps career now, and I am really keen to start moving towards a more proactive/strategic method of working, as opposed to the more reactive/tactical way of which I find myself currently doing!\n\nMy questions are:\n\u2022 Those who have made this transition consciously already, what activities did you undertake to support this & what else helped you to do so? \n\u2022 What do you think the most crucial behaviours are for someone looking to make this kind of transition?\nThank you!\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n\u2022 *Research things related to RevOps roadmaps*. A whole RevOps function can never be 100% strategic, because we're a service-based team. But you can take steps to be not 100% reactive, and have a greater portion of your full work-set be proactive over time. \n\u2022 *Automate as much as you can for things related to putting out fires, and get your intake process for RevOps requests really solid.* Then you can review your completed work and match up requests to roadmap items (or not, because of the reactive:proactive ratio, not everything will map and that's ok). Then you can show that you're working strategically, and how much, and improve it over time. We shifted from Asana to Notion to be able to do this. Shoutout to <@Ufcf5e7e> for his support in helping my team improve our intake!\n\u2022 *Be the one that is forward looking.* What's coming down the pipeline?

Status is a physical action that you need to take in order to move a stage forward or at least a way for you to know where things are at.

You try to tie the two together as much as possible...but there are definitely events or reasons when they won't all tie together.\n\nOpportunities/Deals are separate...but should be joined and/or aligned with the Account lifecycle. That all said, I have built a separate type of \"sales process status\" field on Opportunities to streamline actions that need to take place...instead of creating multiple reports for them:\n\nExample:\n\u2022 if Close Date < TODAY...Sales Process Status = \"fix close date\"\n\u2022 if Amount is still default value $ at Stage x...Sales Process Status = \"update amount\"\n\u2022 if Forecast Category = Pipeline and Close Date = This month...Sales Process Status = \"fix close date\"\n...etc etc sometimes multiple reasons can be present and you just need to think through how you want to display/report/action that. The nice thing about having actual values for these is that you can build more granular reporting and or escalations paths on actions that need to take place.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nOK, thanks.

To me, I see a pretty clear drop in month #3 down to 6% and some trickle in from there, but those seem to have been related to the campaign, but were not created from the campaign interaction.\n\nMy suggestion based on this data would be a window of 1 month prior to the event up to 3 months after the event. We recognize these opportunities as sourced by the campaign and we can just stamp them and monitor closed won as they come in from that opportunity creation cohort.

That sucks for sales as they put the effort in without recognition so something to align with Finance on the benefits/risks to include into as commissionable.\nAs the team have gone up-market to larger deals we incentivize those larger deals via payout month 13-24.

There wasn\u2019t really an easy short form methodology where they can easily and quickly get through. the barriers change for each client/customer and your product.\n\nIf you want the best feedback the ask should come from who owns/owned the relationship for the best results. If it\u2019s a current client you should have the AE or CSM reach out to initiate the survey for the product team or who will handle it. Depending on the relationship between your reps/csms and current/former clients you will definitely get friction/encouragement from the sales team.

And of course you will get friction on closed-lost, but that\u2019s where you get the best feedback.

There were certain blockers we had at the time like no SOC2 and another huge one was we didn't even have SSO to offer our clients, those aren't impossible to get around and if you aren't targeting finance, legal, and HR companies you should be okay to get around those blockers. The issue wasn't the product as a rep from that company is was really a sales issue and product was confused why they prioritized certain features in the past but enterprise deals still weren't closing. Product was going crazy and it wasn't because of the product and the features they updated/added it was a sales process issue. The lack of knowledge in the sales team led to deals being lost and product was able to find that out from talking to clients that were paying for our best features that would save them hours but no one had made them aware.

How will marketing ever invest well around Channel Marketing if there is conflict. To remove this conflict I have seen organizations provide credit to both teams. In situations this is different, Programmatically this all needs to be flowed out with clear buyoff by management on paths of credit. But First touch includes response activity with the Contact at any level. This means the contact has responded and or engaged with clear line it was from a marketing campaign or person. Though its an unfortunate situation because it makes a operational mess.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U7c45151> we have a 'Joint' bucket we got rid of that was shared between marketing and SDR. It caused a lot of problems when it came to reporting and where we put dollars. My thought process is there are a lot of ways to slice and dice the data. We could use the campaign hierarchy to supplement reporting on 'joint' and understanding where to put dollars, but then still able to track how each team is performing to their specific targets.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U5b010aa> - If you can isolate marketing activities into a hierarchy that a great method. I would still recommend putting together a plan for credit paths and walk through that visually, this transparency and at the end sets expectations on credit achievement.  Gives you a little more space to focus other things then one of fires. :)\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nLove this - thank you for the advice <@U7c45151>!\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nAs others have said, if there is a setup like this where teams are competing for credit, you end up with misaligned incentives... Definitely worth making sure that both teams get credit in this scenario and that comp is structured to align the teams.\n\nAlso - I find that teams always want a single number when it comes to attribution... I think it needs to be a multi step analysis and approach. In this case, you want to understand that paid search is driving qualified leads that end up converting _and_ that the channel team is successfully converting them through.\n\nHappy to have a chat on this as well if you are interested\n---End Of Response---",

I'm a big fan of converting everything that is \"qualified\" or being worked into Contacts.

I did a quick review of 20 top SaaS and software companies ranging from 250 employees to 15,000 employees. Less than half had a phone number listed and only one company (Hubspot) connected me with a salesperson immediately that helped answer pricing and packaging questions.\n\nGenuinely curious why more software companies don't offer a phone number, what do you think is the primary rationale for not offering that option?\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nDoes anyone have an actual telephone anymore?\n\nProbably a mix of:\n\n1.

If your near monopoly in terms of market or offering, you could have limited service channels but customers still have to buy your product thus not terribly impacting overall NRR with churn.\nIf your highly competitive commodotised market you need to differentiate your experience. The question of do you offer the phone as a channel comes down to how much self service your product can do and complexity of what you sell. You'd also need factor a mix of cost to serve, something like an NPS and overall impact to churn and NRR. \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\ni think it also has to do with the quest to make everything as efficient as possible.\n\nMost tech companies want us to fill out a form and based on that they do a routing to the right person.\n\nSome have a demo booking form and you can book a demo based on the availability of the rep.\n\nWhich gives the illusion that I as a buyer have a choice but it is more a convenience feature for the company (and cost saving).\n\nBut more importantly the rep can prepare for the call. To \u201cnail\u201d the call\n\nNow, with a call system. There is no pre qualification. The initial person that picks up needs to do the prequalification.\n\nIf that person can\u2019t answer the question, then they need to check if the person who can answer it is available. Some logistics and proper call routing is required here. Usually, big tech companies like oracle, IBM, HP, etc they have this.\n\nTo me this sounds some companies are quite lazy.\n\nChatbots are another tool that are convenient for the seller but an inconvenience for the buyer.\n\nI usually contact the chat because I could not find information on the homepage or want to ask a question that deviates from the standard set of questions.\n\nThe chat bots are trained on knowledge that is on the homepage or the knowledge base. Usually, this gives me no extra info.\n\nSo i end up typing multiple times: human please, human please, human please\u2026\n\nUntil i get a message asking for my email to get back to me\u2026 Sometimes it works and I end up with a human.\n\nAs you can see from my message, I had a few bad experiences with dozens of platforms.\n\nOften the same pattern.

If so, these are probably Users (maybe also Contacts but not tied to a customer Account). \n\u2022 \"ERP Contacts as Leads\" only if there isn't a corresponding Account.

So I thought creating them as contacts and relating them to the account would ensure the sales team have no excuses for not notifying the AM.\n\u2022 Yes, good shout.

For example, if you have stages with loose qualification early on, you will likely see a low win rate since you are going for \"At Bats\" vs. optimizing your sales resources to revenue. You can also use it as a diagnostic for velocity if you look at deals generated by month by stage (eventually, all deals should either be won/lost so you can see deals dragging)\n\nI have measured Won/Lost as more of a forecasting tool since you are looking at outcomes for a given period without factoring in time to close.  This tends to play better with leadership as there is less context to account for, but you end up digging into the above view to understand what's happening.

From deal creation to closed won what is that close ratio and where (which sales stage) do we lose most deals?\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI used HubSpot once like 2-3 year ago. Didn't love it because I struggled to put together these types of reports that I was used to accessing quickly in SFDC. I'm fairly sure HubSpot doesn't allow last stage tracking and can't calculate conversion formulas -- or at least it didn't while I was using it a few years ago. I always had to export raw into excel and setup the formulas myself.

Binary or on a spectrum?\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nAre you open to thoughts on the subject in general? I don\u2019t have any wording to share, but I\u2019ve seen similar things implemented before and it can get very messy. \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U3ea86ca> on a spectrum.\n\n<@U532ecff> yes, please!\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSo I think it\u2019s a lot easier conceptually than it is practically. And a lot more useful conceptually than practically. First of all, how do you define CRM hygiene? There are a lot of different components to \u201cgood\u201d data in a sales role, and listing all of them in one clause would get unwieldy. Something like requiring all Deals to be inputted into the CRM to get paid is more doable, but that\u2019s only a small part of the adoption equation. It\u2019d be a decent stopgap measure if there was an issue of multiple Deals straight up not existing in the CRM, but it wouldn\u2019t solve for the overall problem which is low adoption/utilization. \n\nBut then you have the unintended side effects . There is a very real risk that tying pay into administrative functions (depending on how substantial) will cause a noticeable decrease in the time reps are spent selling. Obviously that is not an ideal outcome. \n\nThen there\u2019s the possibility that if you get too granular, people will find ways to circumvent processes and do what they want anyway. Which worst-case-scenario could end in completely inaccurate data you don\u2019t even realize is inaccurate. If you require properties X Y and Z to be filled out to get commission, what\u2019s stopping someone from theoretically just putting in whatever\u2019s fastest? How would you even know if something like that happened? I remember hearing a story about an org in which call time was one of the primary sales KPIs. Instead of resulting in longer, more thorough sales calls, the reps just called phone trees and 1800 numbers. \n\nMy LinkedIn friend Nick wrote a great post on the subject a few days ago actually: <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-bryner_salesforce-activity-7159633772856958976-HiuX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios|https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-bryner_salesforce-activity-7159633772856958976-HiuX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios>\n\nTL;DR: In a limited capacity, policies like this might be able to alleviate serious, immediate concerns with data hygiene (keyword is might). But as a long-term way to drive adoption, my opinion is that it\u2019s too complicated and not effective enough to be viable. \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSimply talking to your reps or using tools like rattle is better. If you make small things about money, they will start making small things about money. Exactly what you don't want.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nHey Sales guy here,here is my quick take - id never work for a company that will take away my commissions for bad CRM hygiene. (You will lose a lot of top talent) not because they have to update the CRM but because it shows a flaw within leadership/systems. If your reps aren\u2019t keeping good CRM hygiene currently, it\u2019s a leadership or current systems issue. (9/10 its leadership). \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nUs reps always joke about updating the CRM and being annoyed but we secretly like updating it - an updated/clean CRM will close us more deals and therefore make us more money. \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nBefore getting to this stage, I'd put a lot of thought and consideration, maybe some shadow sessions, to understand *why* they have poor hygiene first\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\ndo it 100%. I am a big fan of tying desired behaviour to incentives.\n\nWe tried in the past:\n\u2022 educating the team\n\u2022 lead by example\n\u2022 training\n\u2022 adding automation\n\u2022 making it as simple as possible\noutcome --&gt; mediocre results.\n\nWe introduced a \u201cdashboard of shame\u201d  if you show up on it. you get bad karma. helped a bit more.\n\nThe dashboard of shame was the optimized and tied to commission payment.

Works like wonder.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI like the dashboard of shame idea, makes it a bit more competitive for the reps \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nlow key here for the dashboard of shame\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\n<@U8c9825a> right, that's not a bad idea however I'd be wary of reps focusing on wrong things. Their main objective is to build relationships not to maintain metrics.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nIMO this is a bad move.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSorry, I do not have any wording to share but would definitely recommend not using incentives for this. Salesfolk can get extreme creative to get around any rules you lay down. As mentioned before, this is most likely a leadership issue.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nTie sales comp to the business they bring in. Let the managers help keep CRM hygiene front and center as part of their job. The way I solve for this is to build a hygiene score at the team level and put the managers on a leaderboard\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nHere's an idea for how to do hygiene compliance <https://revengine.substack.com/p/sales-operations-toolbelt?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fhygiene&amp;utm_medium=reader2>\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSales people are competitive AND want to make some $$$. Focusing on CRM hygiene indirectly makes them $$$, not directly. Just because you have a clean CRM doesn't mean you'll close deals. Sales managers make better forecasts when the data is clean so push this onto them. They can then push it on down to the reps. This will be more effective because they have a DIRECT reporting structure to the rep. Having sales ops do this is INEFFECTIVE and ANNOYING. \"Hey sales rep, this is the 52nd consecutive week of nudging you but 60% of your deals are out of date\"; multiply this message across your entire team. OR have a tool do it... still annoying and ineffective.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSales managers are COMPETITIVE. Put it on a leaderboard. I used to like the SHAME and CLEAN YOUR ROOM idea but it treats reps like CHILDREN.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nBe an ally to the sales org. I suggest finding different ways of messaging what should otherwise be a straightforward solve.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nit is a sensitive topic as I can see. Just saying I have seen in working. Better sales performance and better data hygiene. nobody left the job. Everyone happy\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nComing back to this, it's interesting to see both sides of the argument - thank you all for your contributions!\n\nI am now leaning towards not adding it to comp plan, and creating a \"dashboard of shame\" for sales managers.\n\nWhy? New leadership this year :100:\n\nPrevious leadership did not enforce CRM hygiene consistently.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work?

SDR feedback loop was often around the fact that they were comped the exact same as decision/purchase stage handraisers. So the results of 'Event A vs Event B' in #attributed meetings or $pipeline volume ends up more like apples-to-oranges.\n\nAnyways that's where my thoughts have taken me thus far, will share some interesting scoops if I end up launching an experiment in the near term!\n\n<@Ua0e35b9> Dogs, leaf blowers, Bart trains, you name it!

I've experimented at another company with fully automating highest-intent/warm IB straight to AE calendars and we saw a (form submit-to-meeting scheduled) jump around ~12-15%. But to your point about that _*sometimes_ higher quality, I think there is still value in SDR IB qualification so (meeting held-to-opp created) C% doesn't tank and time isn't wasted. In this thread's scenario, I'm pondering if a flat monthly/quarterly SLA $kicker suffices to cover Warm-IB. So team is technically comped much less there vs Cold-IB or OB, but they earn guaranteed $ if they properly qualify the hand raisers within \"# bus. hour(s)\" for example. Unsure if that's enough risk mitigation against our warmest IB waiting too long though.\n---End Of Response---",

While I'm not in a RevOps role...yet, but I've been in sales and sales leadership for the past 10+ years.

Follow ups on company level data work great, as evidenced by quite a few tests, but always good to cover what individuals you can.\n    a. If you do get a contact level provider (<http://Customers.AI|Customers.AI>, <http://Retention.com|Retention.com>, SimplyIntel, Leadfeeder are all working on offerings here) then recommend piping it through <http://Clay.com|Clay.com> so that if a contact doesn't have an ICP title or ICP company (this is a complex table to build, haven't done it yet), then find someone else with the same last name in the same city/geo and check for ICP title and ICP company.\n2. buy an engagement layer. We call this an \"<https://www.linkedin.com/posts/evanpdunn_what-is-allbound-first-video-in-a-while-activity-7161462299772239872-8v00?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop|allbound\" platform>. - you need a way to engage these 1st party intent sources with sales. Not just retargeting for ads (don't need a tool for that anyway just a pixel, or a series of pixels), but sales engagement on-site with chat, and follow-up via sequences.\n\nTo your q - market leader on 1st party intent for a long time has been Clearbit Reveal. Some niches consider Leadfeeder the leader. But it's still very much up in the air as evidenced by this new wave of 1st party intent _sources_ and _engagement_ platforms.\n---End Of Response---",

When a project was closed won, all of the services details IE hours authorized for various deliverables etc. We automated the creation of a \"Project\" opportunity type which the Account owner can keep track of progress of the project.  This is where you should look as synchronizing the Project Management applications and Hourly billing bact to this standardized record object.  By doing these type things you start creating a 360 view of the customer and all their products and Projects.

I wouldn\u2019t lose too much sleep over it. You can always change that within another system to equate what you want without hard coding\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nYou can always overwrite the default probability using a flow. So have it check record type and then set according to stage. I don't think you can set a different probability by Sales Process, unless you added different versions of each stage with different weights. I wouldn't recommend that unless they were fundamentally different stages\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nTo me it makes sense to adjust the probability based on Stage by record type if historically, the close rates are significantly different\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI worked at Salesforce for years and this is how our instance was built. We used Einstein for forecasting and it took probabilities when applying a probability on deals. That rolled up to a forecast number that would be compared to managers judgement on forecast. \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nAndrea, At a high level, having different expected probabilities of close based upon oppy type and stage is a standard, if not best practice.  The stages and probabilities should align to the assumptions in the operating plan for the fiscal year.  That would mean that you have conversion rates for each stage, as well as cycle times, to forecast when the opportunities convert to bookings.   Typically, you would work back from a cumulative conversion rate of ~25% for New, ~50-60% for Expansion, and at least 70% for a Renewal.  In addition to validating what is in the operating plan, I would suggest backtesting with the most recent 6-12 mos of data.  Doing that last bit of work will tell you where the greatest risk, or opportunity, in execution lies.\n\nOne key question I would have is this: Is the probability-weighted forecast going to be THE forecast the CRO or Head of Sales delivers to the CEO and CFO each week?  If not, then all of this work on stages and probabilities might be a somewhat futile effort.\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nWe do this today and have found it much more useful since separating by record type. The analysis is a bit more in-depth, as is how you implement, but I think the juice is worth the squeeze. I try to look at these weighted forecasts as more directional than a 'guarantee,' but our weighted forecast has been super close to actual forecast and finish since going through this effort.\n---End Of Response---",

    "02b63683-0cab-4302-acc3-3312fdae7c51": "# Start Parent Conversation\nI have never seen, in 18 years using salesforce the value in Probability based forecasting. Why.  because if you have clearly defined stages ( less than 10) and you consistently your track milestones along the way. As an opportunity moves up through the process and for example you get to a Proposal stage. You at that point know what the exact value is of the deal.  Sure the final negotiated price may change but you are still moving forward if you are negotiating and at a point where actual Terms/contracts' are under review, you will ether win or loose it.  In additional as you get the deals on the closing process your close date should get more accurate. Everything before a formal proposal has less than a 50% potential. But you can feed yourself on potential.  Have very well defined stages with expected milestones defined that are clear to the selling teams. as an example of they don't know who the signor or the signing process it can not be greater than a 50% stage value, not revenue value.  Over time you should be able to determine Win rate of created qualified Opps that are at least at a stage 1 or 2. Secondly you know what your average deal size is.  All qualified deals start there and then are adjusted through the process so by the time your at 50%-80% you should have a more  exact amount. Finally what your average closing time.  I've see all kinds of math gymnastics, my guide is Keep it simple consistent and Mange your team from the actual Opps in the CRM  with less voodoo guestimation. Its half art and half science  enjoy\n# End Parent Conversation\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nSpot on, thanks for sharing! I have seen so many \u201clate stage\u201d deals without decision makers/signors, and 90% of these deals are garabage \n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nTo me, probability does not really exist. It either happens or it does not so I was never a fan of weighted pipeline/forecasting in the first place\n---End Of Response---\n\n---Start Of Response---\n\nI used to feel this same way, however I made a change to our weighted forecast amount formula and it has been very, very close to final results for the past few quarters.\n\nWhat I did was run historical win rates on count _by stage_ first, then historical win rates on amount by stage next, and lastly I ran the same thing with historical win rates by Forecast Category. To pull these reports, we had to have history tracking on the stage, forecast category, and amount fields.\n\nThen, I incorporated these rates into the end formula. I'll be honest, I didn't expect a much better result, because logically it just never made sense to me that we'd close 'x'% of the amount just because the deal got to a certain stage, but I've been single digits away from our finish several times now.\n\nI've also found it interesting that the forecast my VP of Sales has been submitting weekly is almost within a few percentage points off of the weighted forecast value. Now, I'll never just rely on this formula alone, but it's at least direction after going through the above process :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n*edit: Wanted to quickly clarify one thing, when I say 'win rates by stage,' I mean how many of our deals that got to stage 2 (for example) ended up going to closed won. Same thing for amount, then same thing for forecast category :bulb:\n---End Of Response---",
