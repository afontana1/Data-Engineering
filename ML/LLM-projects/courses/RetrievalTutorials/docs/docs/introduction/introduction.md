> **Retrieval** is the process of bringing extra information or context to your language models. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a system that augments a Large Language Model (LLM) by adding extra context or information from another source.

**Retrieval is hyped** (2nd to only to agents), but it is still **underrated.**

This guide has two aims:

1. Help you understand the full landscape of retrieval in context aware applications
2. Explore options for to tune, tinker, and improve your retrieval process

### Start Here ðŸ‘‰ [Retrieval Overview](retrieval-overview.md)

**New to retrieval?**

Glad to have you! Start off by checking out our [Retrieval Overview](retrieval-overview.md), this will be the home base for this guide

**Advanced Retrieval?**

We still recommend getting a lay of the land on our [Retrieval Overview](retrieval-overview.md) then branching to the section that interests you. Then head over to the [Retrieval Inventory](retrieval-inventory.md) to explore more.

### Why do we need a guide on retrieval?

Connecting your AI applications to the outside world (via retrieval) are a core part of what makes your applications rich. It's often the magic moment to your users.

But retrieval can be confusing and misunderstood, especially when we lack a 30K ft view of the retrieval process.

This guide will start from the basics, work our way towards a mental framework to think about retrieval, then dive in deep with code, videos, evaluations, and examples.

### What format will this guide be in?

The #1 goal is to help you ramp up to speed on retrieval. This means we are mostly agnostic

* We'll be package agnostic - All popular libraries (LangChain, Llama Index, etc.) will be featured
* No sponsorship allowed - We will make quality content, not biased content
* Heavy preference towards python
* We'll mostly be using OpenAI because it is easy, but also mix in open sourced models

### Who's behind this?
