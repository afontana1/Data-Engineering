💡 Welcome to the "AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen" course! The course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to build and customize multi-agent systems using AutoGen.

## Course Summary
In this course, you'll explore key principles of designing multi-agent systems and enabling agents to collaborate on complex tasks using the AutoGen framework. Here's what you can expect to learn and experience:

1. 🎭 **Conversational Agents**: Create a two-agent chat showing a conversation between two standup comedians using “ConversableAgent,” a built-in agent class of AutoGen.
