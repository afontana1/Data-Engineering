Learn LLMOps best practices as you design and automate the steps to tune an LLM for a specific task and deploy it as a callable API. In the course, you'll tune an LLM to act as a question-answering coding expert. You can apply the methods learned here to tune your own LLM for other use cases.

- Adapt an open source pipeline that applies supervised fine-tuning on an LLM to better answer user questions.
- Learn best practices, including versioning your data and your models, and pre-process large datasets inside a data warehouse.
- Learn responsible AI by outputting safety scores on sub-categories of harmful content.
