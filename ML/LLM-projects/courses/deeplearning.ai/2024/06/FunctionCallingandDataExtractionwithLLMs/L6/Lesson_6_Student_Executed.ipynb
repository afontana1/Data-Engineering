      "Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll be happy to help you with that. Can you please provide me with your order number?\n",
      "Customer: Sure, it's 12345.\n",
      "Agent: Thank you for the information. May I know the reason for the return?\n",
      "Customer: As I mentioned earlier, the product is not working correctly. I want to return it and get a refund.\n",
      "Agent: I'm sorry for the inconvenience. We would be happy to process your return and refund. However, since you have opted for Cash on Delivery, it will take some time to process your refund. Our refund timelines for Cash on Delivery returns are usually within 7-14 business days from the date of pickup. \n",
      "Customer: What? That's too long. Why does it take so much time?\n",
      "Agent: I understand your frustration, but the refund process takes time as we have to verify the product's condition and ensure that it's unused and in its original packaging. Once we receive the product, we will initiate the refund process, and it will take 7-14 business days for the refund to reflect in your account.\n",
      "Customer: This is unacceptable. I need the refund immediately. Can't you do anything about it?\n",
      "Agent: I'm sorry, but we cannot expedite the refund process. However, I can assure you that we will process your refund as soon as possible. \n",
      "Customer: Can you at least tell me the status of my refund?\n",
      "Agent: Sure, I can check the status of your refund. Please allow me a moment to check that for you.\n",
      "(Customer is put on hold for a few minutes)\n",
      "Agent: Thank you for waiting. I have checked your refund status, and I see that your return has been received by our team. The refund process has been initiated, and it will reflect in your account within 7-14 business days.\n",
      "Customer: Alright, I understand. Is there anything else I need to do?\n",
      "Agent: No, you don't have to do anything else. Our team will process your refund, and you will receive an email confirmation once it's done. \n",
      "Customer: Okay, thank you for your help.\n",
      "Agent: You're welcome. I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\n",
