      "4. **Diversification**: It is crucial to diversify the trading strategies and not put all investments in a single stock. Considering overall market performance and diversifying the portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Risk Management**: Regardless of the chosen strategy, it is essential to have a clear risk management plan in place. Setting stop-loss orders, defining profit targets, and continuously monitoring market conditions can help protect investments and optimize returns.\n",
