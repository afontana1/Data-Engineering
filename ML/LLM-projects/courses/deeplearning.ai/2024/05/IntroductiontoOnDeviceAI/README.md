Introduction to On-Device AI, a new short course made in collaboration with Qualcomm and taught by Krishna Sridhar, Senior Director of Engineering at Qualcomm, is live!

 

As AI moves beyond the cloud, on-device inference is rapidly expanding to smartphones, IoT devices, robots, AR/VR headsets, and more. Billions of mobile and other edge devices are ready to run optimized AI models.

In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to deploy AI models on edge devices using their local compute power for faster and more secure inference:

    Explore how deploying models on device reduces latency, enhances efficiency, and preserves privacy.
    Go through key concepts of on-device deployment such as neural network graph capture, on-device compilation, and hardware acceleration.
    Convert pretrained models from PyTorch and TensorFlow for on-device compatibility.
    Deploy a real-time image segmentation model on device with just a few lines of code.
    Test your model performance and validate numerical accuracy when deploying to on-device environments
    Quantize and make your model up to 4x faster and 4x smaller for higher on-device performance.
    See a demonstration of the steps for integrating the model into a functioning Android app.

Start deploying AI models from the cloud to smartphones and edge devices!

## Details
- Learn to deploy AI models on edge devices like smartphones, using their local compute power for faster and more secure inference.
