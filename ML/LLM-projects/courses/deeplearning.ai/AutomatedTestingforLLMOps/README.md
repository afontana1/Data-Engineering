# Automated Testing for LLMOps

https://learn.deeplearning.ai/automated-testing-llmops

Learn how to create an automated continuous integration (CI) pipeline to evaluate your LLM applications on every change, for faster, safer, and more efficient application development.

- Learn how LLM-based testing differs from traditional software testing and implement rules-based testing to assess your LLM application.
- Build model-graded evaluations to test your LLM application using an evaluation LLM.
- Automate your evals (rules-based and model-graded) using continuous integration tools from CircleCI.


- Level: Intermediate: 
- Instructor: Rob Zuber
- Prerequisite recommendation: Basic Python knowledge and familiarity with building LLM-based applications.
