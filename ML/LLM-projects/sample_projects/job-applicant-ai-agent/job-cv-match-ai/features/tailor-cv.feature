Feature: AI Agent for Tailoring Resumes and Preparing Questions

As a business owner of a career development platform
I want to offer an AI agent that takes a job link and a resume to return a personalized CV and preparation questions
So that job seekers can enhance their applications and interview performance, thereby increasing user satisfaction and platform engagement

Scenario 1: Job Seeker Submits Resume and Job Link
    Given a job seeker is registered on the platform
    When the job seeker submits their resume and a job link to the AI agent
    Then the AI agent should analyze the job description and resume
    And provide a tailored CV highlighting relevant skills and experiences
    And generate a list of preparation questions relevant to the job

Acceptance Criteria:

    The AI agent accurately fetches and analyzes the job description from the provided URL.
    The AI agent customizes the resume by including relevant keywords and reformatting sections.
    The preparation questions are pertinent to the job role and industry.
    The process should be completed within a reasonable timeframe.

Scenario 2: Increasing User Engagement
Given the AI agent's functionality
When job seekers use the AI agent and find it useful
Then they should be more likely to return to the platform for additional services
And recommend the platform to others

Acceptance Criteria:

Track user engagement metrics before and after using the AI agent.
Monitor user feedback and satisfaction scores.
Measure the rate of returning users and referrals.
Scenario 3: Enhancing Platform Differentiation
Given the competitive market for career development tools
When the AI agent is integrated into the platform
Then it should provide a unique selling proposition (USP) that differentiates the platform from competitors

Acceptance Criteria:

Conduct market analysis to compare similar features in competitor platforms.
Highlight the AI agent's capabilities in marketing and promotional materials.
Increase in new user registrations and platform usage metrics post-launch.
Scenario 4: Ensuring Data Security and Privacy
Given the sensitive nature of resumes and job applications
When job seekers submit their resumes and job links
Then the platform should ensure data security and privacy measures are in place

Acceptance Criteria:

Implement encryption for data transmission and storage.
Adhere to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Provide clear privacy policies and user consent mechanisms.
Key Metrics to Monitor
User Adoption Rate: Track the number of job seekers using the AI agent.
User Satisfaction: Collect feedback and ratings from users regarding their experience.
Resume Success Rate: Measure the percentage of tailored CVs that lead to job interviews.
Engagement Metrics: Monitor the frequency of platform visits and usage post-AI agent interaction.

Conclusion
By focusing on these business-oriented BDD scenarios, the AI agent can drive user satisfaction, engagement, and platform differentiation while ensuring data security. This approach aligns the AI agent's functionality with the business goals, creating a compelling value proposition for both users and the platform.
