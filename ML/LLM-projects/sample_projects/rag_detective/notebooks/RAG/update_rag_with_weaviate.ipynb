    "# RAG with Weaviate Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a working process we've developed for RAG. It's not intended to be ready for production, but instead as the source of production code. It describes a web scraper designed to scrape websites based on their `sitemap.xml`. For every page scraped, a CSV file is generated containing the scraped content. The filename of the CSV embeds the website address (e.g., `www.apple.com`) and a timestamp indicating when the scraping took place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there's a length constraint on the documents (e.g., a limit of 500 words), the schema is designed to handle segmented portions of the scraped text, termed as \"text chunks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSV Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CSV file has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filename**: `{websiteAddress}_{timestamp}.csv`\n",
    "- **Columns**:\n",
    "  - **key**: An identifier for the text chunk, typically indicating the webpage (e.g., `https://www.apple.com/iphone/`).\n",
    "  - **text**: The content of the text chunk, representing a segment of the webpage's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schema Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure is the `TextChunk` class, representing a portion of text scraped from a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TextChunk\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: A segmented portion of text from a scraped webpage with full details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **key** (`string`): The identifier for the text chunk. It's generated based on the specific webpage URL and the chunk number, e.g., `{data['key']}_chunk_{i}`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **text** (`string`): The content of the text chunk. Given the constraints on document length, this content may represent only a segment of the full webpage's text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pageURL** (`string`): The specific URL of the scraped webpage this chunk originates from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **websiteAddress** (`string`): The root address of the website from which this chunk was scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **timestamp** (`date`): The date and time indicating when this chunk was scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TextChunk` class utilizes the `text2vec-openai` vectorizer with a module configuration set for `gpt-3.5-turbo` from OpenAI. The class is also set up with an inverted index configuration to index timestamps."

    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems such as the one we're creating, combine the power of large-scale transformers with external retrieval or database mechanisms. They allow for real-time fetching of relevant external context, which is then used to assist in generating the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can't give an LLM the entire set of information we have to answer a question, we have to split it into chunks of text. For a model like GPT-3.5 with a maximum context size of 4096 tokens, this translates to about a maximum context size of 3000 words. However, we also have to account for the response of the model, as the maximum context includes the size of the completion as well. Therefore realistically, we should keep our total number of words less than 2000. The means that $n_{chunks}$ x $size_{chunk}$ needs to be less than 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a trade-off between text chunk size and the number of chunks, there are a few key points to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Granularity\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks provide more context in each retrieval, which can be beneficial if the answer to a question is spread out or requires understanding a broader context.\n",
    "   - **Number of Chunks**: Retrieving a higher number of smaller chunks can be beneficial if the information is quite specific and located in smaller, discrete portions of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval Speed and Efficiency\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks might slow down the retrieval process as they require more time to be fetched and processed.\n",
    "   - **Number of Chunks**: If you retrieve a large number of chunks, it can also slow down the retrieval process, especially if the underlying database/retrieval mechanism isn't optimized for high-throughput, low-latency operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Complexity and Computational Overhead\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks mean that the model has to process more data at once, increasing the computational overhead and potentially leading to a higher risk of missing key details.\n",
    "   - **Number of Chunks**: While processing multiple smaller chunks might seem computationally more manageable, combining and cross-referencing information across chunks can introduce its own complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Limitations\n",
    "   - Both larger chunk sizes and a higher number of chunks can be constrained by memory limitations, especially when dealing with models that have a fixed context window size (like the 4096 tokens limit in GPT-3.5). If a chunk or the combined set of chunks exceeds this limit, it can lead to truncation or omission of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise vs. Signal\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks might bring in more noise along with the relevant signal, especially if only a small portion of the chunk is relevant to the query at hand.\n",
    "   - **Number of Chunks**: Fetching more chunks increases the likelihood of retrieving relevant pieces of information, but it might also introduce more noise, making it harder for the model to focus on the most pertinent details."

is not required to use the core functionality of descript. if you decide to use this feature, here are a few things you should know: you may only use recordings of 'consenting speakers' to create 'overdub voices.' as part of the overdub voice creation process, speakers must read a script, designated by descript, which states the speakerâ\\x80\\x99s identity and affirms their consent to overdub synthesizing their voice. no other voice recording can be used for creation of an overdub voice. we train and host your artificial voice using google cloud . also, we use the audio that you shared as 'training audio' to improve our service. after your overdub voice is created, descript generates a series of non-defamatory samples using your overdub voice and shares them with amazon mechanical turk so an impartial human can listen to them and assess their quality. also, descript employees may listen to samples of your training or generated audio for quality assurance purposes. other than described above, only you and people you explicitly grant permission to will have access to generating synthesized audio using your overdub voice. your rights as our user you have a number of rights:

(however, you can share the stock files with your client or other third party for the limited purpose of getting their help with your specific project, assuming you are adding substantial value to the project apart from the stock files. otherwise, they need their own license.) for the avoidance of doubt, your use of storyblocksâ\\x80\\x99 stock files in descriptâ\\x80\\x99s user created templates shall be fully authorized under this section and enable sharing of those finished projects with the same rights, including a perpetual licenses, given to other content under this section. you also agree to use your best efforts to secure the stock file from being accessed by a third party as a standalone file, but since thatâ\\x80\\x99s not always possible, your inability to prevent copying will not be considered a breach of this license. 2. our guarantee we promise that if you use our stock files as described in this license, your use will not infringe on the rights (such as copyrights) of a third party (the â\\x80\\x9climited warrantyâ\\x80\\x9d). weâ\\x80\\x99ll also put our money where our mouth is. in fact, we will provide you up to $20,000 in indemnification if you incur any direct damages either from us or descript breaking this promise. because thatâ\\x80\\x99s a big number, we need to make a few things clear, so here come some capital letters. in no event, including negligence, shall we or descript be liable to you or any third party for incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind. descript and our maximum aggregate liability for all breaches of the limited warranty will be limited to the lesser of the actual, direct damages suffered by you directly arising from such breach and twenty thousand dollars.â note that trademarks, logos, or copyrights depicted within our stock files are not covered by this guarantee. for example, if one of our videos depicts someone holding a brand-name beverage, that label may be protected by copyright and trademark law and should be used at your own risk. (we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want you to think that this license lets you reprint coca-cola cans.) 3. limitations there are a few other limitations we have put in place to protect our artists and other customers: 1.â\\xa0 \\tyou cannot sell, license, or redistribute our stock files, nor can you build your own stock media site with our files. you cannot create a trademark or logo based on our stock files. you cannot use automation, such as computer scripts, to download or â\\x80\\x9cscrapeâ\\x80\\x9d high volumes of our stock files. finally, you cannot use the stock files to harm minors, to encourage violence, or for an unlawful purpose, such as defamation. 2.â\\xa0 \\tfor stock files that depict identifiable people (â\\x80\\x9cmodelsâ\\x80\\x9d), you must not depict the models in a way that a reasonable person would find offensive. just to be clear, the issue is whether the depiction of the models themselves is offensive, not whether your project as a whole may be offensive. for example, you could use stock files with models in a documentary about a rare and embarrassing medical condition, but you should not depict the models in a way that suggests they personally carry the condition, unless our video clip already depicts them that way. 3.â\\xa0 \\tfor our audio stock files, storyblocks has cleared all rights, including pro licenses, such that your license does not restrict your right of public performance, but a cue sheet may be required to satisfy the requirements of performance rights organizations (â\\x80\\x9cprosâ\\x80\\x9d). also, this license allowed you to use our audio clips in youtube videos, but since we are not associated with youtube, we cannot prevent other people from incorrectly claiming that your video violates a copyright. if you get such a claim, let us know, and we will make our best efforts to help you resolve the problem. still, platforms like youtube could block your content for reasons beyond our control. 4.â\\xa0 \\tsome stock files may have additional restrictions, such as â\\x80\\x9ceditorial use only,â\\x80\\x9d which will be noted in the clipâ\\x80\\x99s details. 4. other legal provisions this part may not be fun to read, but itâ\\x80\\x99s important nevertheless. 1.â\\xa0 \\tthis agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of delaware, excluding its body of law relating to conflicts of law and copyright law. if any provision of this agreement is found invalid, the other provisions will not be affected.â\\xa0â\\xa0except for claims brought in small claims court, all disputes about this agreement will be settled by arbitration pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association (â\\x80\\x9caaaâ\\x80\\x9d), subject to the federal arbitration act. the dispute may be arbitrated either by jams or aaa. you are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. you are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court.',\n",

       "  'text': 'should you use descript to edit your vlog? should you use descript for your vlog? last updated 10/20/20 hello vlogger! if youâ\\x80\\x99re reading this, we assume itâ\\x80\\x99s because youâ\\x80\\x99re trying to decide if descript is the right tool for editing your vlog. instead of just giving you a sales pitch, weâ\\x80\\x99ve prepared a faq to help you determine if descript is right for you. our guidance will evolve as we ship more features, so please check back. and if you have questions that arenâ\\x80\\x99t covered here, let us know and weâ\\x80\\x99ll add them! â\\x80\\x8d how is descript different from other video editors? â\\x80\\x8d â\\x80\\x8d the biggest difference is that when you record or import video, we transcribe it, and then you can edit the video by editing text. if you want to delete an outtake, just select the words in the script and delete them, and the video goes along for the ride. if you want to add an image, title, b-roll, or music, you just drag it into the script where you want it to appear. itâ\\x80\\x99s really just like using a doc. descript also has a timeline editor, designed to be used in conjunction with the script, when you need to fine-tune clips or add transitions. you can even close the script view and use it like a traditional editor. â\\x80\\x8d what are the main reasons to choose descript? itâ\\x80\\x99s easy, fast, and fun . not only does descript bring editing within reach for people who arenâ\\x80\\x99t experienced with timeline editors, itâ\\x80\\x99s just way faster to edit with descript, even if youâ\\x80\\x99re a timeline editing pro. and because youâ\\x80\\x99re not spending as much time futzing around with clips on a timeline, youâ\\x80\\x99re spending more time in the creative part of your brain instead of the technical part. itâ\\x80\\x99s really fun to use. itâ\\x80\\x99s collaborative. descript is also the first audio/video editor that has google docs-style multi-user editing and commenting . while descript is a desktop app and it can run offline, when youâ\\x80\\x99re online, everything is synced to the cloud, so you donâ\\x80\\x99t have to mess around with files and stuff. descript works the way you expect software to work in 2020 (but no other video editors do). we have some crazy features that no one else has. for example, you can remove all of your â\\x80\\x9cumsâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cuhsâ\\x80\\x9d with a click . also you can create a clone of your voice and use it to make corrections to your voiceover without re-recording. or use that same voice clone to forgo recorded audio altogether and just type your entire voiceover. hereâ\\x80\\x99s an example of a customer that did that: â\\x80\\x8d â\\x80\\x8d it also works with audio . descript is a new kind of editor thatâ\\x80\\x99s equally at home making editing audio as it is with video. so if youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking about, for example, making a podcast and a video from the same raw content, you can do that all with one tool. what are some reasons that descript might not be right for me? features . the biggest reason would be if we donâ\\x80\\x99t yet support a feature that you canâ\\x80\\x99t live without. descript has everything most vloggers need ã\\x83¼ non-destructive multitrack editing, titles, basic transitions, animation, 4k export, a screen recorder, subtitles, and more ã\\x83¼ but weâ\\x80\\x99re not going to sit here and pretend you can make an avengers movie with it. yet! here are some things that we donâ\\x80\\x99t have right now: complex animated title sequences, color grading, visual transitions other than simple dissolves, chroma keying, clip speed, clip rotation. if those or other features are important to you, vote them up on our feedback board . your videos donâ\\x80\\x99t have a lot of speech in them. if you make instrumental music videos or something, you can do that with descript, but youâ\\x80\\x99d just be closing the script view and using it like a normal timeline editor, so the upside isnâ\\x80\\x99t as big when compared against other video editors. maybe youâ\\x80\\x99d still use descript because itâ\\x80\\x99s collaborative? mobile. if you need to edit on a mobile phone, we donâ\\x80\\x99t do that right now. lots of people like adobe rush for mobile editing, so check that out if you havenâ\\x80\\x99t already. language. descript only works in english. can i use descript in conjunction with other editing tools? â\\x80\\x8d â\\x80\\x8d yes - you can do your initial edit in descript and then export to premiere or final cut pro. our timeline export feature preserves your clip edits and original files. this feature is popular with many of our customers who are more experienced video editors - they use descript because itâ\\x80\\x99s so fast to do the initial cut, and then they export to another tool for final touches. â\\x80\\x8d i still need help deciding! you should just download descript and noodle around. trying it out is free and, regardless of whether you decide to become a paying customer, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing like it and using it will give you that make you feel like youâ\\x80\\x99re in the future. so if you cultivate experiences like the first time you put on a vr headset, check it out for one of those. descript is a collaborative audio/video editor that works like a doc . it includes transcription, a screen recorder, publishing, and some mind-bendingly useful ai tools. capture screen recording transcription remote recording edit podcasting video editing overdub (text to speech) filler word removal share teams publishing social video subtitles squadcast is joining descript! get remote recording free. learn more â\\x86\\x92 product tour features for work resources pricing sign in sign up',\n",

using a very advanced (but benevolent) kind of artificial intelligence. descript research scientists (also benevolent) trained a computer model to recognize sounds that distract the human ear from speech â\\x80\\x94 background noise, echo, reverb, and so on. then they taught it to create those sounds. and then they reversed the process, so it could learn to remove all the sound you donâ\\x80\\x99t want, leaving the stuff you do. thatâ\\x80\\x99s a highly simplified version, but the rest is highly proprietary (plus, nobody understands it except the researchers). even if i admit thatâ\\x80\\x99s kind of cool, why should i care? because studio sound enables you to record anywhere, on any microphone, and still come out of it with clean, crisp, high-quality audio. it solves one of the most vexing challenges creators face: how to deal with bad audio quality in post-production. why should i use your fancy studio sound thing? iâ\\x80\\x99m a trained audio engineer. because it can save you enormous amounts of time. rather than spending a half hour carefully scrubbing out background sounds from the voiceover for your podcast or video, you can do it in a single click. then you can still adjust levels, add eq, and do all the other things you do to make audio sound amazing. weâ\\x80\\x99re just helping you skip one of the most annoying parts. my voice sounds slightly unnatural after i apply studio sound. can i fix that? yes. in regenerating your voice studio sound may leave it sounding a little low (ironically, it may sound more like the voice you hear in your head than the voice you actually emit). the best way to address is this is by using the studio sound intensity dial. itâ\\x80\\x99s preset at 100 by default. if youâ\\x80\\x99re voice sounds weird, try reducing the intensity until it sounds normal or the background noise starts to leak in. how can i use it? on your podcast, vlog, tutorials, product demos, you name it. if you\\'re an audio or video editor, studio sound can speed up your workflow on everything from audio editing to recording to scheduling â\\x80\\x94 no more waiting until you or your guest can be in the perfect recording location. how do i get studio sound?

no. when creating an overdub voice, descript users must positively affirm their identity and give descript their express consent to train and generate a synthesized version of their voice. voice-training data that does not include this voice id cannot be used to create an overdub voice. in other words, unless you specifically consent to overdub voice creation, descript will not create your overdub voice. we verify this consent by authenticating the audio file uploaded against our training script to ensure that the voice recorded belongs to the person submitting it. is descript text-to-speech free? overdub text-to-speech is free on all descript accounts. pro accounts get an unlimited overdub vocabulary. is there a difference between overdub generated with the pro subscription vs. a creator or free subscription? yes. while you can create a custom voice on overdub with any subscription, â\\xa0free and creator plans are limited to a list of the 1,000 most common vocabulary words. any words that are not on that list will be replaced with \"jibber\" or \"jabber.\" to avoid this gibberish and gain access to the full vocabulary list, you can upgrade to the pro subscription. how can i improve the quality of my text-to-speech voice?

sign up descript vs. camtasia workflows pricing summary descript: the best camtasia alternative while camtasia and descript share some recording and editing features, descriptâ\\x80\\x99s ai-powered tools will save you a ton of editing time â\\x80\\x94 and give you the power to make a professional-grade video, as easy as editing a doc. get started for free contact sales comparing descript vs. camtasia\\'s features from automatic captions and filler-word removal to live collaboration, descript saves you hours of drudgery and gives you everything you need to make screencasts that engage and educate. camtasia automatic captions collaboration easy publishing filler word removal keyboard capture mouse capture picture-in-picture social clip generator stock media library studio-quality background removal text-based editing video with interactive featuresâ workflows why trained video pros and total newbies alike choose descript over camtasiaâ recording & video editing recording and adding b-rollâ camtasia and descript have comparable video recording tools: you can record your screen, webcam, microphone, and system audio in either. they both let you select which part of your screen to record, and both make it easy to add b-roll. the moment you stop recording though, descriptâ\\x80\\x99s ai-powered editing will instantly start making your life easier. editing a mistake from your voiceover camtasia works like any traditional, timeline-based editing software. that means constant zooming in and out of the timeline, fiddling with waveforms, and scrubbing through the recording to find what you need. in descript you get an auto-generated transcript â\\x80\\x94 then edit your video just like you would edit a doc. to cut part of your video, just select that text in the transcript and tap delete, and itâ\\x80\\x99s gone. and you can find any clip or moment youâ\\x80\\x99re looking for in seconds â\\x80\\x94 just search the transcript like you would a doc. removing filler words in camtasia, like all legacy timeline editors, you have to manually cut filler words (â\\x80\\x9cum,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cuhâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9clikeâ\\x80\\x9d, etc.). it can take hours. descriptâ\\x80\\x99s automatic filler word detection, on the other hand, can find and highlight filler words, so you can remove them all, all at once, with a single click. descript will delete the words from your audio track and automatically crossfade the audio on either side, creating a pretty seamless edit â\\x80\\x94 and save you a ton of time. recording pickups with camtasia, every mistake or omission in your audio will mean re-recording and splicing in the corrected version. itâ\\x80\\x99s not only a hassle, it can create jarring discrepancies in the audio and video, as things like room tone and lighting shift between recordings. descript solves all these problems using generative ai. with overdub, you can create a text-to-speech clone of your voice, then fix audio mistakes or add new voiceover just by typing; overdub will match the tonal characteristics to make the new word blend right in. itâ\\x80\\x99s vastly easier than re-recording. switching between screen & camera layouts changing layouts â\\x80\\x94 e.g., from only your screen to only your face â\\x80\\x94 is doable in camtasia, but tricky. every time you want to switch, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to do it manually, using layers and the blade tool, from scratch â\\x80\\x94 even if youâ\\x80\\x99re using the same few layouts over and over. descript makes it way simpler. just record your screen and your webcam in the descript editor; descript will capture them as separate tracks. to change layouts you just set up each layout as a scene by typing a slash, then right click to copy your layout, and just paste it each time you want to use it. organization exporting & video hostingâ only descript lets you publish a shareable web page, where collaborators and colleagues can watch the video, see the transcript, and leave comments. collaboration in descript, collaboration works like google docs. so you can share the video without downloading, and colleagues can see edits and updates just by refreshing the page. file management & version control only descript constantly saves your files to the cloud. that means you donâ\\x80\\x99t have to worry about saving constantly to avoid losing changes. and you can see and revert to previous versions. ai tools & editing features green screen remove your background with a click, then put yourself in any setting you can imagine. studio sound descriptâ\\x80\\x99s ai-powered voice-regeneration tool will make even the lowest-quality audio sound like it was recorded in a studio. text-based editing descript makes trimming a screen recording (or any video) as easy as editing a doc. pricing comparing descript vs. camtasia\\'s pricing to get everything you get in descript, youâ\\x80\\x99d have to buy a subscription to camtasia (for recording and editing), audiate (for transcription services), and pay for access to camtasiaâ\\x80\\x99s asset library. that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t include camtasia support beyond your first year. descript pro gives you all that functionality at less than half the cost a descript pro subscription gives you full access to all descriptâ\\x80\\x99s features, stock

for less than half the cost. thatâ\\x80\\x99s why the overall winner is descript. the screen recording options may be mostly the same, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s the easy part of making video. as soon as you stop recording, descript makes it easier to make a better video, faster. editing is just more intuitive, even more fun, than in camtasia. â\\x80\\x8bâ\\x80\\x8bâ\\x80\\x9ddescript is an extremely

Techniques such as histogram equalization, gamma correction, SIFT, SURF, RPCA, and the use of CNNs, GNNs, and semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, along with data augmentation strategies, have all been instrumental in overcoming these challenges. Continued investment in research, development, and training of the next generation of computer vision scientists is vital for the field’s evolution. As computer vision advances, it will play an increasingly important role in driving efficiency and innovation in many sectors of the economy and society. Despite the challenges faced, the future of computer vision technology remains promising, with immense potential to reshape our world. Computer vision platforms of tomorrow The most recent wave of generative AI technologies will prove instrumental in shaping the next iterations of computer vision solutions. Today’s computer vision platforms use AI to detect events, objects, and actions that neural networks have been trained to identify, but tomorrow’s platforms may use AI to speculate the outcome of events, objects’ state or positions, and the results of actions before they occur. The true challenge of today’s AI-powered vision-based systems is their narrow understanding. For a model to “know” how to spot more objects, it must be familiar with those things. More knowledge means more training and heavier models. Our society is on the precipice of general AI, which will provide always-on, hyper-intelligent, digital assistants to tomorrow’s enterprises. Such assistants will not just know how to detect things it knows, but they will know how to learn and how to communicate what they see. Replicating human visual understanding has never been closer to a reality as it is today.

set the threshold too low and legitimate inputs will be blocked. using a custom model, which is less susceptible to prompt injection out of the box, makes the tradeoff easier and allows a developer to choose a higher threshold while guaranteeing the same level of safety. appendix: no data? no problem! jurassic-1 custom models offer excellent accuracy even when trained on a surprisingly small dataset. nevertheless, sometimes even a small annotated dataset is hard to come by. wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be nice to enjoy the benefits of custom models without collecting any labeled data? as we will now demonstrate in our topic classification case study, this is possible. first, we note two simple observations: a prompt engineering solution with 1-4 examples per class achieves reasonable accuracy. the model assigns a probability to the label it generates, which indicates its â\\x80\\x9cconfidenceâ\\x80\\x9d in the label. high-confidence labels are more likely to be correct predictions. relying on these two observations, we propose the following simple approach: collect many unlabeled input examples for topic classification. use a', 'timestamp': '2023-10-06T18:11:24Z', 'websiteAddress': 'ai21.com'}, {'key': 'https://www.descript.com/terms_chunk_9', 'pageURL': 'https://www.descript.com/terms', 'text': 'block or prevent future your access to and use of the descript service at any time with or without cause. upon any termination of your right to access or use the descript service, you will cease all use of the descript service , and we will delete all of the user content that may be stored in connection with the descript service. you are solely responsible for making backup copies of any user content. 18. transfer and processing data in order for us to provide the descript service, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the united states and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law. 19. binding arbitration;

Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. And the next question is a comment. We need a webinar on model creation. Well, I’m sure we’ll publish one on that very soon. Is there an advantage to using a tight bounding polygon over a simple bounding box, advantages of background removal? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, that’s a very good question. So depending on your use case, bounding box or polygon, you’re going to choose between the two basically. And data scientists know which ones work for what. For 90% of use cases that we do, bounding box is fine. But even the bounding box itself, it actually segments that piece out. And that’s how the 2D generation is generated. So background removal is crucial. You cannot do background removal without polygon segmentation. And that’s how the 2D synthetic works. But in terms of inferencing and creating data set, bounding boxes are usually enough for generic deployments. We have sensitive deployment like satellite imagery or radiology, you definitely need polygon. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yep. We already answered to some degree, perhaps you’re getting to dive into this a little bit. Do you support edge inferencing? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, we support edge inferencing. The inference engine is exportable into the GPU devices and also Intel devices. And it’s basically a Docker that you pull and it gets set up within half an hour. And you can put models onto it, you can do updates, you can erase models, you can visualize the inferencing on it. So yes, edge inferencing is a crucial part of this whole system because if you don’t have edge inferencing, it’s virtually impossible to scale video in the long run. Jeffrey Goldsmith: And we’ve actually got documentation on how to deploy to the edge on our website, under the products section at the bottom. There’s a few different help documents. Next, synthetic data looks different. How can we know it will perform well? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so it looks different and you’re going to have to iterate on it. And that’s what we do as well. And the way to iterate is you create a model, basically. And you create the model on the system and see how it performs, test it on the system that you’ve created the synthetic data on, it’s basically all together. So you’re right, you need to iterate on these. It’s not going to perform well the first time. It’ll perform … Depends on the use case, obviously but usually it takes us about four to five iterations to get to a model that is production ready. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Pretty technical question here. Do you use GANs or VAEs to create synthetic data? Emrah Gultekin: This is a good question. And we are not using GANs or VAEs to create yet, but we’re using randomization. I think some our ML engineers can answer this much better. But basically, we’re in the process of putting GANs into the system, though, as we speak.

you to train a capable model using only a small amount of data, and makes it very easy to query your model once itâ\\x80\\x99s trained. to train a custom model of your own, all you need to do is provide us with a small dataset of correctly solved examples, and we will do the rest. the quality of results you get from a custom model depends on the amount and the quality of training data you provide. as a starting point for most tasks, we recommend using 50-100 examples, since we find this is often enough to achieve great results. so, if you can get your hands on a few dozen examples, we recommend you try our custom models. even if you donâ\\x80\\x99t have data at all, we have a few tricks you can use - see the appendix for more details. to pick up where we left our topic classification case study, we trained custom models for ag news while varying the number of examples in the training set. the resulting accuracy on the ag news test set is shown in the table below. as you can see, with as few as 10 examples our custom modelâ\\x80\\x99s accuracy is comparable to j1-large with a few-shot prompt. we also see that adding more training examples results in better accuracy for our custom model, surpassing j1-jumboâ\\x80\\x99s few-shot performance with only 80 training examples. ag news test set accuracy for custom jurassic-1 models trained on datasets varying in size. custom models really start to shine when we take latency into consideration. feeding the general purpose j1-jumbo model with an engineered prompt consisting of 16 examples, we got an accuracy of 86%, and the typical processing time in this case is ~250 milliseconds. a custom model that matches or exceeds this accuracy only needs to process the summary and title of the individual example weâ\\x80\\x99re labeling; there is no need to include a lengthy prompt in every request, because the task-specific behavior is already baked into the model. as a consequence, our custom model can process a typical request in less than 50 milliseconds, offering a greater than 5x speedup compared to prompt engineering . appendix: engineering the prompt an easy way to start engineering a prompt is to feed the model with simple instructions for the required task, such as the following: to predict the label for a given article, we could input the text above followed by the article title, its summary, and a heading that prompts the model to output the correct label as a completion. the full prompt using this scheme follows below. we can replace the text highlighted in blue with the relevant title and summary for any inference example weâ\\x80\\x99d like to label and let the model generate a continuation after â\\x80\\x9cthe topic of this article is:â\\x80\\x9d. this is commonly

If you’re talking about the models being deployed on mobile, we don’t do that at the moment. But we do deploy on Nvidia Jetson devices, also Intel CPUs as well. But in terms of the mobile apps, it’s traditionally been just API call on the cloud. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah, we actually have a mobile app if you search in any app store for Chooch IC2. You can install it on your phone and try it. It basically sends screen grabs from your video feed to the cloud and it sends back metadata. It’s pretty cool, actually. So next question, how important is it to train the data with different backgrounds? Can we load our own backgrounds with different conditions and lightings to train? There we go. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, it’s a good question. So we have some preset backgrounds that you can use. But usually what happens is the client has their own warehouse or manufacturing area, then they can load up that background as well. And so you can use that background to synthesize your data as well. So that’s under my themes.

And as Peter mentioned, and you can start toggling and applying different filters, so if you have an incident and you want to drill down to say, “Hey, I need to go back to this day, at this hour, on this specific camera,” you can now filter that and quickly access some of the analytics behind it. So here you can see the pie charts with all of our forklifts, our smart loading… And then if we actually go to alert images, you can actually get a snapshot view of some of those alerts that have occurred. So in this case, in our forklift danger, we have a person that’s very close to the forklift and one of the zones. So we’re able to highlight that as well.

That variation can be on the amount of data being supplied and the complexity in which we’re tackling. Now, traditionally, a typical model can take between six months to a year to develop, but with the tools that we show today, you can rapidly develop models and being very conservative in a matter of a couple of weeks. And that’s with a lot of testing being done and making sure that the accuracy is where we would like it to be. That’s a good question. Andrew: Yeah, great question. Great question.

Is it possible to train them on like … We answered this to some degree but is it possible to train the model and export it in order run it without Chooch? Emrah Gultekin: This is a good question because what happens is these models that you see on the Chooch system are not really single models. They’re always ensembles, and they’re encoded with information from the past, from the purpose that it has already generated over the years. So it’s not possible to do it without the Chooch system on prem or on a device, but you’re able to export the system as well. So you can export the system to wherever you want to, but you can’t take these models out of a vacuum and have them perform. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Let’s see here, could you say which one works better, training the model with synthetic data entirely and later fine tuning the model with real data or training the model with a hybrid data, synthetic data and real data? Depends on the use case. Emrah Gultekin: So it’s always better to have real data, that is key. It’s always important to have that. The more real data you have, the better your model’s going to perform in the long run. But if you don’t have real data, you need to synthesize it. And that’s where the synthetic data comes into play.

Emrah Gultekin: It’s going to be a … So think of it this way, you do have a lot of data out there. But it’s unstructured. And our duty as people in the computer vision industry or AI and generalist is to structure that data. So the way you structure data is by seeding it through the inference engine in order to detect things. So the impact it will have on computer vision is enormous in terms of getting the models out and having different types of models. We think it is. Synthetic data is very, very important. But again, it’s a tool. It’s not the end all in this. So we don’t want to overemphasize something. It is an important tool but it is part of a larger thing that’s going on in computer vision. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Is the background combined with data and synthesized? I’m not quite sure I understand the question there. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. I think I do but maybe I’m wrong. So in 3D synthetic data, you have the object file, the CAD file, the material file, MTL and then you choose a background as well. So you choose the background images. It could be an already generated theme on the system that we have or it could be your own theme. So it is synthesizing randomize with those backgrounds. So the background is not synthesized. The background is what you put into the system. So you might have like 2000 images of background of your warehouse and that’s where you’re going to be placing those different objects. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. The last question in Q&A and then we’ll move over to the chat. Can you please explain using randomization for synthetic data generation? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So in terms of randomization, you have different tools here that you are able to … There are toggle switches basically. So if you’re a power user, you can randomize the way you want and basically, place things in the places you want or you just use general randomization. And it’s on a randomization principle, where you can basically just let the machine randomize what it’s doing. But what’s important here is if you are a power user, you want to be able to control that randomization. And so you have those toggle switches in advanced settings to do that. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Emrah, are there any particular verticals that … E.g manufacturing where you see more adoption of synthetic data? Emrah Gultekin: Honestly, the clients don’t care about the use of synthetic data or real data, or what type of data you’re generating. What they really care about is how the model performs out of the box, how the model performs in their environment. So what we’re seeing more and more though is that the synthetic data is being used more in certain verticals where', 'timestamp': '2023-10-03T15:30:00Z', 'websiteAddress': 'www.chooch.com'}, {'key':

defined it. So in this case, we already have a device created and we’re running on a T4 GPU. And when we come in, we can now apply different streams. So adding a stream is fairly simple, you’d hit add stream, give it a name, and let’s call this… Airport runway, and then you would give it an IP. We’ll just give it a blank IP here, and we’ll hit add string. So now this new stream data has been added. And then you can go into this stream and apply a model. So if we go into one, like our smart loading example, we already have a forklift custom model built, but if we wanted to, we can add additional models to it, so we’re not limiting you on the amount of models that you can add per stream. So let’s see what this actually looks like. So this new screen I just came into is our edge dashboard. This edge capability can be in your private cloud, it can be on premise, or you can also leverage our cloud as well. Now here, you’re seeing all the different people, forklifts, boxes, and packages being annotated and detected here, and you’re seeing everything in red. Those are all the current objects and people that are being detected. Now we want to take it to another level and apply some additional analytics to this. So if we come back to our dashboard here, we can go to our analytics settings… And here’s where we start defining our different classes and groups. So now we can additionally group person and forklift together. So you can create a group like we have done here, and then we can go to our zones tab. So these are all like Peter was mentioning earlier, we can annotate different zones. So in this case, on our zone map, you can see we have an unloading zone and then we have a loading zone. So once you use, and it’s the same tooling that you saw before for doing the annotation, it’s just a no-code approach. We can then go to rules. So in this rule, we have defined danger zone. So it’s a person, forklift, and the unloading zone together for more than one second, then we will generate an alert. So if we go back to our devices, what users can additionally do is be alerted either in real time, or select a different frequency. So here you can see that I’ve applied my email to this alert and reports email, and frequency, you can do either real time, you can do end of hour, end of day, end of week, or end of month, and then you can include the alert images in', 'timestamp': '2023-10-03T15:30:00Z', 'websiteAddress': 'www.chooch.com'}, {'key': 'https://www.ai21.com/blog/current-state-of-ai_chunk_2', 'pageURL':

model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecastsand currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name *

ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata,

examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is

Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. Well, thank you everyone for your questions. Oops, there’s one more. Hi, in my experience, that question about domain adaptation, isn’t it a sub discipline of machine learning which deals with scenarios in which a model train on a source distribution is used in the context of a different but related target distribution? Emrah Gultekin: Right, okay, so you’re talking about the domain in that sense? Yeah. If the domain is changing and you have … Let’s say the views are changing, the domain is changing, usually you need to tweak the model. And that’s part of the process of creating a dynamic user feedback for a grift. That’s really what this is about. So if you go back to the earlier slides where you’re getting new user feedback with annotated or with just raw images or video streams, with a change in domain, you’ve put that into shadow data sets which are checked by humans and checked by a machine. And then either you retrain the model, or you create a new model if the domain is very, very different. So there are few layers that are going on to trigger different models, depending on the scene and on the domain. Jeffrey Goldsmith: So second last question. If anybody has anything else, please post it now. So what kind of support do you have for transfer learning? Transfer- Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So the whole system is based on transfer learning actually, that’s how we’ve generated these models and these classifications as well. So it’s based on transfer learning from a base data set that we’ve trained initially, and we keep retraining that as well. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, great. Well, I think we are done here. Thanks for the talk. Can you share the recording with us? Absolutely, I can share the recording with you. It’ll be on the blog tomorrow. You’ll get notified by Zoom. Look for a link on the LinkedIn invite for the event and we’ll post it there. Emrah, thanks for the presentation. It was really well done. And thanks to the team for all your hard work putting together this technology. Please get in touch with us if you want any one on one support. And we’ll talk to y’all soon.

And then we have things like smart annotation, so that’s going through and automatically labeling a lot of these. So if you already have, let’s say 30 aircrafts, you can go through smart annotation and be able to automatically let the system annotate all those aircrafts for you. And then the last thing is I call it the knockout punch, is using augmentation. What augmentation will do, it’ll take all those images and then apply either rotational or horizontal flips, then start adding additional, basically shifting scaling rotation, noise, blur, and brightness, and contrast to the images that are being generated, to allow for different environmental considerations. Now, just to show you what our annotation tool looks like, I’ll go into this image real quick… And here you can see this is going to be a no-code approach to labeling and annotating. So all we’re doing is taking this tool and actually drawing our bounding box around this aircraft. So we can just click drag and draw, and then we can label it as a 747, and once we hit save, you’ll see this number actually increase. Now we have 1,772 images , as well as annotations. And just to give you an idea of what the 2D synthetic looks like, so this aircraft is labeled and facing the left. Now, if I go to the next image, you’ll see the same aircraft is just resized facing the opposite direction with a different background now applied to it. So these are the ways and methods that we’re able to now generate larger amounts of data, so you can create a strong model. Now, once your data is annotated and ready to go, what you can do is just hit, create model, give it a name and then hit create. And once we hit create, Chooch is going to take this internally and start running through and building a model for us. So now what we can do is once we have these models developed and they’re built in-house with your annotations and your maybe data scientists applying their knowledge into it… And again, this can be anything from detecting objects or detecting anything from, let’s say, cancer or bacteria cells on X-ray visions. So it’s basically taking the expertise of an individual, like a doctor, and applying it to the AI. And once we build the model, then you can go to your devices.

This approach advocates performing as much computation as possible on edge devices situated near data sources, as opposed to relying heavily on distant cloud servers. Edge computing is a hot trend that is reshaping the standard topology of distributed systems. Current state of e dge computing The 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle for Edge Computing offers a deep dive into the ongoing innovations in this sphere. It delineates the high-impact developments and those on a slower trajectory to maturity. A notable prediction is the transformative role of Edge Computer Vision in businesses in the next 2 to 5 years. Despite being in its nascent stage, with a 5-20% market adoption, it holds a promising future, warranting continuous evaluation and exploration. Let’s explore the role edge computer vision applications play in edge computing, its important, business drivers and benefits of adoption, and obstacles for implementation. And see why Gartner recognized Chooch as a sample vendor for edge computer vision alongside some of the largest players in the industry. Understanding edge computing and edge computer vision Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data closer to its source or at the “edge” of a network, rather than sending all data to a centralized cloud server or data center for processing. Edge computer vision, on the other hand, is a specific application of computer vision technology that entails deploying computer vision algorithms and performing visual perception tasks, such as object detection, image recognition, and video analytics, at the edge of a network or on edge devices, like cameras and drones. This provides localized analysis and decision-making, bypassing the need for constant connectivity to central servers or cloud infras tructure . Edge computer vision applications promises quicker responses, heightened data privacy, and optimized system performance. Significance of edge computing Video and image usage has grown significantly from simple surveillance and monitoring to operational tasks. As computer vision finds increasing applications in various sectors, including employee safety and security, surveillance, manufacturing QA systems, and retail loss prevention, the necessity for swift data analysis grows. Businesses now require real-time responses to critical events. Edge computing and edge AI computer vision systems meet this demand, allowing for automated, timely analysis at the point of data capture. For example, advanced applications like object recognition and anomaly detection in manufacturing and smart check-out in retail are driving the need for more advanced and improved edge computer vision systems. D eploying edge computing : Benefits and challenges The deployment of edge computing and edge computer vision systems is set to escalate with the advent of techniques addressing hardware constraints and data availability issues. High-resolution cameras with higher data volumes need high-performance edge computer vision systems to lower bandwidth and latency constraints. New model compression and optimization techniques enable larger models and workloads to run on resource-constrained edge hardware.

Jeffrey Goldsmith: Another question from the same attendee, your platform is only used to generate training data sets and annotations or do you put together object AI recognition applications too? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. That’s a good question. So our core is actually the inferencing. So the models arc is our core. These are only tools to beef up the data set in order to make the model better. So, that’s really what this is about. But the core is the model. So you just click create model, and you click the data set that you’ve generated and it’ll just generate that model, and then you can test the model on the same system. Jeffrey Goldsmith: And we’re almost done with the questions here and we’re 10 minutes before the top of the hour. Does your system handle domain adaptation? Domain adaptation. Do you see that question, Emrah? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, I don’t understand the question. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Matthew, could you rephrase that potentially, if you’re still on the call and we’ll answer that in a moment. How much accuracy increased going from 2D to 3D synthetic? Emrah Gultekin: So we can say, in general, depending on how much data you have, from real data manual data, which you might have 100 images of and then you create 2D let’s say with augmentation, 1000 images, you’re going from 50% accuracy to about 90% on average. But it really depends on the use case. From 2D to 3D, there’s no comparison because it’s a different thing. 3D synthetic data is very, very different. So we don’t have metrics on that. But from going from real data to any type of synthetic with augmentation, you’re basically reducing the accuracy by leaps and bounds. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, looks like this our last question. Usually, 2D image, object detection is feasible. What about 3D image object recognition? Where are we on that? Emrah Gultekin: We don’t do 3D object detection or recognition. It’s 2D. And the reason is because the market … All the sensors are 2D, all the cameras are … It’s an important question and we see a future on that.

So depending upon the business model and the needs and how complex use cases, we can enter either all three possible pursuits. Thank you. Andrew: Awesome, thanks Peter. Another question regarding the private cloud, can you be installed on my private cloud? Peter: I’ll take that one as well. Our solution is very flexible in that it can be deployed a hundred percent in the cloud, or there could be also what we call the edge component OnPrem, but the edge component can also deployed in your cloud as well, so we’re very dynamic to what can deployed and where it is. We can try and explore that further based on exactly what would be the required compute and things like that. Andrew: Exactly. Thanks Peter. This one’s regarding alerts. Funny timing, right after you Peter, does our platform have the ability to send out SMS alerts, not just email alerts? Peter: Yep, and I’ll grab that one as well. So in addition to email and SMS, be it reports or alerts, we do support MQTT integration as well. And so that’s a standard within the IoT or OnPrem interface and industry, so we can integrate to an MQTT broker and then provide our predictions via JSON or things like that. Thank you. Andrew: Awesome, thanks Peter. Another one that we have here is how many public models does Chooch currently have available to customers? So I can kind of tag this one, we have over 250,000 models and it really comes down to, with our team, with the rapid model development. That’s how we have come to this number. I think we got time for maybe a couple more here as we keep going through here. Oh, someone’s done their homework. You did not mention anything about the IC2 app. Can you talk a little bit more about the IC2 app and how it connects with public models? Peter: One minor correction to what you just said, Andrew, it actually classifications or annotations. So that means, hey, we’re able to look for smoke, car, wave, boat, et cetera, but we have upwards about 80 different models, varying from image, object detection, facial detection, and also text detection. We have up to 250,000 different type of classes for those detections. Going to your second question there, Andrew, thank you for that in regards to IC2. So the IC2 mobile app, be it for Android or Apple is a way to demonstrate and test out our general deep detection, analytic, or model we have in our solution.

judging by our results so far, this might be a tall order for prompt engineering. finally, we note that custom models have safety advantages. since they are trained to perform a particular task, it is harder for a malicious user to abuse access to a custom model. we give an example of this in the appendix . in the next section we introduce custom models as a more precise, scalable and cost-effective alternative to prompt engineering, which allows us to overcome the limitations described above. custom model solution custom models are specialized versions of the general purpose models which we have been using so far, trained to deliver optimal results', 'timestamp': '2023-10-06T18:11:24Z', 'websiteAddress': 'ai21.com'}, {'key': 'https://www.descript.com/terms_chunk_4', 'pageURL': 'https://www.descript.com/terms', 'text': 'to the usage limitations and confidentiality obligations set forth in section 9 below. 8.3 user conduct rules. in using the descript service, you must at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. all rights not expressly granted in these terms are reserved by us. you are solely responsible for your conduct while using the descript service. user is solely responsible for userâ\\x80\\x99s conduct and agrees not to do any of the following in connection with the descript service: (a) use the descript service other than for its intended purpose and in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying and using the descript service or that could damage, disable, disrupt, overburden or impair the functioning of the descript service in any manner;

This allows for easy manipulation of the audio or video, such as deleting, rearranging or adding new content, and also allows for easy searching and organization of the media files based on the transcribed text. Descript also has features such as built-in AI voice cloning and real-time collaboration, making it a versatile tool for content creators, podcasters, and other media professionals."
