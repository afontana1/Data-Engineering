    "In the initial indexing stage, text data must be first collected as documents and metadata. In this implementation, this is performed by the scraping of website. This data must be then split into \"nodes\", which is a represents a \"chunk\" or part of the data containing a certain portion of information. Nodes must are then indexed via an embedding model, where we plan on using OpenAI's Ada v2 embedding model. The embeddings and metadata together create a rich representation to aid in retrieval."

It improved brainstorming and expression, making the process of completing long-form narratives faster, easier, and more fun. AI21 Studio assisted with all key stages of creation, including brainstorming, writing, and editing. It provided a feature for planning the novel scene by scene and chapter by chapter, generating plot points and ideas to spark the writer's imagination. This tool proved to be incredibly useful for writers and kept them coming back for more."
