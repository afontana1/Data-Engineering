jurassic-1 models remain available until june 21st, 2023, after which they will be deprecated in favor of jurassic-2. what is the difference between training and usage rates for fine-tuned models? custom models cost the same to use as pre-trained foundation models. however, training a custom model requires a one-time fee. the cost is dependent on the selected model, and is calculated by the size of the dataset, measured in megabytes, multiplied by training duration, measured in epochs (each epoch is one complete run of the entire training dataset). what is an epoch, and how many epochs are required to train a custom model? when training a custom model, an epoch is defined as one pass of the entire training dataset. typically, models are trained for 5-20 epochs, though finding the optimum number of epochs may require experimentation. how can i track my usage and spending? to track usage, log in and navigate to 'account,' then click 'model usage'. this page shows a detailed view of your organization's usage for the current billing period. to see your future expected payment and previously paid invoices, navigate to 'account', and then click 'billing & plans'. when does the billing cycle begin?

https://www.ai21.com/news/pmi-masking,"pmi-masking publications pmi-masking we present a masking strategy that makes bidirectional masked-lm training more educating. in a nutshell in recent work described by an iclr 2021 spotlight paper , we show how to replace bertâs random input masking strategy during pretraining with pmi-masking, which jointly masks neighboring tokens if they exhibit high correlation over the pretraining corpus. by preventing the model from focusing on shallow local signals, pmi-masking achieves better representations at a fraction of the training budget. despite altering only the input masking strategy, pmi-masking achieves the same bert pretraining quality in one sixth the time and achieves significantly better pretraining within the same training budget. â masking: bertâs added degree of freedom before bert, neural language models (lms) tended to be autoregressive, learning to predict each input token given preceding text. the masked language model (mlm) training objective of bert, for which the model learns to predict a masked subset of the input tokens, creates an inherently bidirectional representation of text. but this bidirectionality comes with an added degree of freedom relative to classical autoregressive lms: choosing which tokens to mask and which to show. our paper highlights that not all bidirectional dependencies are equal: we show that the strategy for choosing which tokens to mask and which to show can profoundly impact an mlmâs performance. specifically, we show that the standard practice of random uniform masking often allows an mlm to minimize its training objective by latching onto shallow local signals, leading to pretraining inefficiency and suboptimal downstream performance. by limiting the modelâs ability to rely on such shortcuts, we obtain the same pretraining performance more quickly and better performance within a fixed training budget. â pmi-masking speed-up and improvement relatively to existing approaches on race. a motivating example to see the potential harm of local signals, we offer a simple, motivating example of neighboring tokens that are highly correlated with each other: part-of-word tokens that make up the same word. recall that bert represents text as a sequence of tokens, where each token is either a word or a part-of-word; e.g., âchairâ might constitute a single token while rarer words like âeigenvalueâ do not make it into bertâs vocabulary and are broken up into several part-of-word tokens (âe-igen-val-ueâ). â when using bertâs regular vocabulary size of 30k tokens, the vast majority of encountered words are represented by single tokens (words are represented via ~1.1 tokens on average). however, when we artificially decrease the vocabulary size to 10k and then to 2k tokens, along the x axis of the following plot, part-of-word tokens become much more common (up to ~2 tokens-per-word on average). â the blue curve in the above figure shows that when applying bertâs strategy of choosing 15% of the tokens for masking uniformly at random, the model's performance is severely degraded as part-of-word tokens become prevalent. thus, by controlling the number of highly correlated tokens, we demonstrate that strong dependencies between neighboring input tokens can harm the modelâs ability to learn from broader context. in the presence of such dependencies, the mlmâs objective can often be minimized simply by considering immediate neighbors of the masked token (consider the easy task âe-igen-[mask]-ueâ). the red curve in the above figure shows that the degradation is substantially attenuated when local cues are occluded. this is done by applying whole word masking, a popular masking strategy which jointly occludes all part-of-word tokens comprising a word. our pmi-masking strategy, presented below, extends this solution to a much more prevalent class of highly correlated tokens: correlated word n-grams. â correlated word n-grams the above example of part-of-word tokens illustrated a flaw in bertâs vanilla random masking approach, and the same issue occurs for correlated word n-grams, a class of correlated tokens that is harder to identify but affects any word level vocabulary. examples include phrases and multi-word expressions such as âeditor in chiefâ, âat onceâ, âcarbon footprintâ, and so on. more broadly, many words provide a hint regarding the identity of their neighbors, and such shallow cues can be used by the model to minimize its objective while putting less emphasis on broader context. previous work has proposed masking strategies that can mitigate the effect of such local cues. notably, sun et al. (2019) proposed knowledge masking, which jointly masks tokens comprising entities and phrases, as identified by external parsers. the restriction to specific types of correlated n-grams, along with the reliance on imperfect tools for their identification, has limited the gains of this approach. with a similar motivation in mind, spanbert of joshi et al. (2020) introduced random-span masking, which masks word spans of lengths sampled from a geometric distribution at random positions in the text. random-span masking was shown to consistently outperform knowledge masking, however, with high probability the selected spans break up correlated n-grams, such that the prediction task can often be performed by relying on local cues. we offer a principled approach to masking spans that consistently provide high signal, unifying the intuitions behind the above approaches while also outperforming them. in order to identify highly correlated word n-grams, we rely on the measure of pointwise mutual information (pmi), which quantifies how surprising a bigram w1w2 is, given the unigram probabilities of w1 and w2 in the corpus. formally, given two tokens w1 and w2, the pmi of the bigram w1w2 is: â where the probability of an n-gram p(w1... wn) is computed by the number of its occurrences in the corpus divided by the number of all n-grams in the corpus. pmi is a good indicator of correlation between words comprising a bigram, but extending it to measure correlation between words comprising longer n-grams is nontrivial. we propose the following extension of pmi to longer n-grams, and show that it provides a better signal than existing alternatives: where seg(w1... wn) is the set of all contiguous segmentations of the n-gram w1... wn (excluding the identity segmentation), and where any segmentation ï â seg(w1... wn) is composed of sub-spans that together give w1... wn. intuitively, this measure discards the contribution of high pmi subsegments of the considered n-gram; the minimum in the equation above implies that an n-gram's score is given by its weakest link, i.e., by the segmentation that comes closest to separability. this way, trigrams such as âkuala lumpur isâ are deranked, since despite the bigram âkuala lumpurâ having high pmi it is not highly correlated with the word âisâ, whereas âeditor in chiefâ, which cannot be broken to uncorrelated subsegments, is promoted for joint masking. experiments by jointly masking n-grams with high pmin scores, we speed up and improve bertâs pretraining. when training models with either bertâs vanilla random-token masking, spanbertâs random-span masking or pmi-masking, in bertâs original training setup (see details in paper), we get the following 1 to 2 point advantage in prominent benchmarks: when comparing to prominent released models of the same size (see table at the top of this post), we see that: pmi-masking outperforms a parallel approach of integrating word n-grams as tokens (pmi-masking vs. ambert). pmi-masking retains its advantage over random-span masking when training continues for 2.4 times longer than bertâs original training (pmi-masking vs. spanbert). pmi-masking reaches the performance attained by vanilla random-token masking after â of the training time (pmi-masking vs. roberta). 1 â sun et al.

https://www.ai21.com/news/sensebert-driving-some-sense-into-bert,"sensebert: driving some sense into bert publications sensebert: driving some sense into bert we enrich the self-supervision strategy employed in bert by applying self-supervision on the word-sense level. our model, sensebert, achieves significantly improved lexical disambiguation abilities, setting state-of-the-art results on the word in context (wic) task. read the paper presented at acl 2020 self-supervision for pre-trained language models the use of self-supervision has allowed neural language models to advance the frontier in natural language understanding. specifically, the self-supervision strategy employed in bert, which involves masking some of the words in an input sentence and training the model to predict them given their context, results in a versatile language model suited for many tasks. nevertheless, existing self-supervision methods operate on the word-form level, and as such, they are inherently limited. take the word âbassâ as an example: in one context it can refer to a fish, in a second to a guitar, in the third to a type of singer, and so on. the word itself is merely a surrogate of its actual meaning in a given context - referred to as its sense . word-sense predictions made by sensebert on a raw input text. the word ""bass"" maps to its different supersenses according to context. sensebert - pre-training on word senses we propose a method to employ self-supervision directly at the word sense level. our model, named sensebert , is pre-trained to predict not only the masked words (as in bert) but also their wordnet supersenses. bertâs current word-form level objective leads to what is commonly referred to as a language model: the model predicts words for the given masked position in a sentence. our added task allows sensebert to gather word-sense level statistics and thereby we effectively train a semantic-level language model that predicts the missing wordâs meaning jointly with the standard word-form level prediction. self-supervision allows neural language models to learn from massive amounts of unannotated text. in order to enjoy this advantage at the lexical-semantic level, we make use of wordnet - an expert-constructed ontology that provides an inventory of word senses. we focus on a coarse-grained variant of word senses, referred to as supersenses, divided into 45 types that semantically categorize the entire language. â labeling of words with a single supersense, for example the word âswordâ which has only the supersense âartifactâ, is straightforward: we train the network to predict this supersense given the masked wordâs context. as for words with multiple supersenses (like the word âbassâ we discussed earlier), we train the model to predict any of these senses, leading to a simple yet effective labeling scheme. â other than our additional pre-training task and the architecture changes that support it, we followed the architecture and training methods published in the bert paper. specifically, we trained models in two sizes, similar to bert model sizes - sensebertbase and sensebertlarge. our results below show significantly enhanced word meaning understanding abilities of sensebert, achieved without human annotation. word-sense predictions made by sensebert on the masked word in the sentence. results ââ in order to test our modelâs lexical semantic abilities, we compared it with bert on two tasks: â 1. â semeval word superense disambiguation we constructed a supersense variant of the semeval-based wsd task, where the goal is to predict a wordâs supersense given context. we trained and tested in two different schemes: a âfrozenâ model with a linear classifier on top (to explore the sense information captured in the modelâs pre-trained embeddings). a âfine-tunedâ model, where the network weights have been modified during training. sensebertbase outscores both bertbase and bertlarge models by a large margin in both cases, and sensebertlarge yields even higher results. â â 2. â word in context (wic) â the word in context (wic) task, from the superglue benchmark, is the task of predicting whether a word has the same meaning in two given sentences. this task heavily depends on word-supersense awareness. sensebertbase surpasses bertlarge, and a single sensebertlarge model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task with a score of 72.14. â â about the author ori ram, yoav levine, itay dalmedigos, dor muhlgay, amnon shashua, kevin leyton-brown, yoav shoham lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. suspendisse varius enim in eros elementum tristique. duis cursus, mi quis viverra ornare, eros dolor interdum nulla, ut commodo diam libero vitae erat. aenean faucibus nibh et justo cursus id rutrum lorem imperdiet. nunc ut sem vitae risus tristique posuere. enjoyed this?

https://www.ai21.com/news/auxiliary-tuning-and-its-application,"auxiliary tuning and its application to conditional text generation publications auxiliary tuning and its application to conditional text generation we designed a simple and efficient method, called auxiliary tuning, for adapting a pre-trained language model (lm) to a novel task, and demonstrated the approach on the task of conditional text generation. read technical paper â what we did we designed a simple and efficient method, called auxiliary tuning, for adapting a pre-trained language model (lm) to a novel task, and demonstrated the approach on the task of conditional text generation. our approach supplements the original pre-trained model with an auxiliary model that shifts the output distribution according to the target task. why it matters achieving state-of-the-art fluency in language tasks such as text generation entails costly training of large lms . auxiliary tuning allows practitioners to amortize this cost across target tasks by leveraging existing pre-trained lms. this is done without modifying the pre-trained weights, avoiding the risks of rigidity and catastrophic forgetting, and allowing natural scaling to multiple target tasks. how it works the auxiliary model is trained by adding its logits to the pre-trained model logits and maximizing the likelihood of the target task output. our method imposes no constraints on the auxiliary architecture. in particular, the auxiliary model can ingest additional input relevant to the target task, independently from the pre-trained modelâs input. furthermore, mixing the models at the logits level provides a natural probabilistic interpretation of the method. results we tested auxiliary tuning on a number of different conditional text generation tasks. adapting a pre-trained lm using our method resulted in similar performance to training a comparable model on the target task from scratch, while using significantly less compute for training. â below we present results for a text generation task conditioned on keywords, where the generated text has to include the keyword provided to the model. we show that our method achieves similar accuracy (the fraction of samples that contain the keyword that we conditioned on) compared to a naive autoregressive transformers baseline. interestingly, our method generates fluent samples early in training, demonstrating its effectiveness of harnessing the fluency of the pre-trained model (as measured by slor ). related methods auxiliary tuning is related to, but different from, fine-tuning, few-shot learning, plug-and-play language model (pplm) and side-tuning . for details, see the technical report. â about the author yoel zeldes, dan padnos, or sharir and barak peleg lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. suspendisse varius enim in eros elementum tristique. duis cursus, mi quis viverra ornare, eros dolor interdum nulla, ut commodo diam libero vitae erat. aenean faucibus nibh et justo cursus id rutrum lorem imperdiet. nunc ut sem vitae risus tristique posuere. enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went wrong while submitting the form."

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/how-contextual-answers-transforms-customer-support,"how contextual answers transforms customer support how contextual answers transforms customer support we've identified gaps where generative ai can create fast, tangible impact for businesses, starting with their customer support teams. learn how our contextual answers system reduces the need for large support teams, while improving customer satisfaction. delivering exceptional customer support is more challenging than ever before. customers expect fast, comprehensive solutions to increasingly complex issues, putting immense pressure on support teams. yet sifting through vast knowledge bases to find relevant answers is inefficient and wastes precious time.â ai21 labs has identified gaps where generative ai can create fast, tangible impact for businesses, starting with their customer support teams. âcontextual answersâ is an ai system based on question-answering technology that allows support agents to search their companyâs extensive knowledge bases to rapidly provide customers with accurate, personalized solutions. it can help businesses boost agent productivity, reduce handling times, and increase their first-call resolution rates â all the while enhancing customer satisfaction. this article will explore how contextual answers integrates into existing workflows to boost productivity. youâll learn how it empowers support teams to deliver the responsive, satisfying experiences customers demand in today's highly competitive landscape. the growing pains of customer support studies show that increasing customer retention by just 5% can boost profits by 25%-95%. and the number of repurchases and renewals also increases by 82% when the customer receives excellent and prompt service. despite the fact that high-quality customer service boosts profits and loyalty, achieving it is a formidable challenge. â costs one major pain point is the substantial cost of staffing large, round-the-clock support teams to meet today's expectations of instant, reliable responses. even then, delivering personalized, researched answers quickly strains resources. effectivenessâ even large teams struggle resolving queries quickly and correctly. inquiries often require extensive research and tailored responses, lengthening wait times and frustrating customers. self-serviceâ despite readily available website information, users often escalate straightforward questions to agents. this overburdens staff and disappoints customers. improving accessibility is key for satisfaction and efficiency. using contextual answers to overcome support challenges what is âcontextual answersâ? contextual answers is a task-specific generative ai system, based on large language models (llms), to provide accurate responses to questions based on a company's data. it lets users ask natural language questions and receives answers grounded in uploaded documents and information fed into the llm. this prevents fabricated responses common with ai, known as ai hallucinations. at ai21 labs, we have built a comprehensive end-to-end api solution which allows companies to effortlessly upload their required documents and allow their employees or customers to ask inquiries using natural language. the responses provided rely solely on the inputted information. in addition, the contextual answers tool provides a reference to the source which the answer was taken from, ensuring an unparalleled level of credibility. how contextual answers can improve customer support there are two main ways to use contextual answers for customer support: improve efficiency the contextual answers system gives customer support agents quick access to relevant information. this makes it faster for them to find answers when customers ask questions, as it significantly cuts down research time. this results in shorter wait times for customers â a significant metric for customer satisfaction. automate responses the contextual answers system can be built into the company's website as a dynamic chatbot or refined search bar. this lets it directly answer common customer questions instantly and accurately. the company then doesn't need to handle questions already answered on its site. this focuses support efforts on complex issues and improves team efficiency. companies can use one or both approaches. but the contextual answers system reduces the need for large support teams either way, while improving customer satisfaction. the ultimate outcome includes a two-fold benefit: a significant reduction in costs of support representatives, along with an elevation in company profits, as a result of the ongoing retention of satisfied customers. how to implement contextual answers in your company 1. make a planâ the first step is to make a plan for what you want to achieve. decide if contextual answers will be used internally, externally, or both. at this point your company will also need to choose an llm provider, exploring factors such as price, the latency of the llms, the throughput (how many questions per user), api quality and ease of use. youâll also have to decide if you need multiple languages. if so, youâll need to add a translation step to the process, and pick which languages to include. for example, an online bank approached us with the need to improve their customer support. being primarily online, one of their main features is having available support 24/7, and contextual answers was a perfect fit for this use case. during the initial planning phase, this digital bank determined that, for their specific use case, an externally-facing customer solution best suited their needs. a user-friendly chatbot was developed to respond to facilitate customer inquiries and provide relevant answers. fast, reliable responses grounded in the companyâs data were the priority. it was equally important for them to maintain consistency in tone, format, and response length during customer interactions. they also included a translation component into the process, recognizing the multilingual nature of their clientele. during the planning phase, these decisions were used as guides to streamline our processes and align them with the bank's specifications. 2. curate and label the data once your company has its plan in place, relevant data must be compiled and curated. if the system is for external use, and customers will be interacting with it, the required data should also be publicly available to customers. for internal use by the support team, the company can also incorporate non-public policies and guidelines. after the data has been collected, it needs to be labeled accordingly.â for instance, a saas company might have premium, gold, and platinum tiers of customers. these tiers use different product features and need different answers to their questions. itâs important for the company to tag each data item with the tier to which it belongs in order to provide the right answers. so when a customer asks a question, contextual answers will know which data to extract the information from, and customers will get answers that match their product features and tier. you can even go further, and personalize the answer according to the customer's profile, giving them a customized and accurate response. in the case of the digital bank that we worked with, they created a database of extensive support documents that included all of the information that they were authorized to provide to their customers. this database was the llmâs single source of truth. it was the context used to answer customer questions, and unanswerable questions were escalated to human representatives. they also aggregated previously asked questions with ideal responses to refine answer formats. this shows how thoughtful data gathering, organization and labeling ensures contextual answers has the appropriate contextual information to deliver precise, personalized responses. this strengthens accuracy while mirroring company guidelines. 3. develop & deploy contextual answers in order for contextual answers to work, the company must synchronize the relevant, curated documents with their chosen ai21 large language model. at this stage, the llm provider will meticulously customize the contextual answers tool to precisely meet the company's needs. when using contextual answers for customer support, a company can adjust the tone of communication based on individual customer profiles. a customer who is older may need a more sophisticated response, while someone who is younger may need a more casual response. as well as extracting personalized information, the llm can extract answers from distinct document sets for each query. additionally, for a retail company, contextual answers can pull from different product manuals and catalogs to find answers based on what the customer purchased. by customizing which documents are searched, it provides responses tailored to each customer's specific items. once the product is developed to meet the company's specifications, it is deployed into their operational framework. in the case of the digital bank refined ai chatbot, seamless integration within the bank's application was executed to guarantee constant accessibility for the users. whether you need to deploy a solution locally or globally, ai21 labs offers an easy plug-and-play option. 4. continuous evaluation in this final phase of the process, it remains vital to maintain a continuous evaluation of the contextual answersââ  performance. thoroughly checking the user experience, whether for employees, customers, or both. an essential component of this evaluation involves validating the accuracy of the generated answers, and ensuring their precision. ongoing monitoring of key metrics is also important. this includes an in-depth analysis of key performance indicators, such as customer satisfaction metrics, retention rates, cost efficiencies, and revenue maximization. this comprehensive evaluation framework provides insights into the extent to which contextual answers genuinely contributes to the company's expansion trajectory, while also revealing opportunities for improvement. in the case of the digital bank, we created a grading system that ranked each chatbot answer from 1-5, whereas 1 was unacceptable, and 5 was ideal. this training ensured acceptable responses aligned with the bankâs requirements. the bank will need to continue scoring its chatbot answers to maintain quality. as a result of maintaining the chatbot's high quality, the bank has seen some positive results, including better customer satisfaction and a smaller customer support team, which reduces costs. conclusion as customers demand ever-faster and more personalized support, contextual answers represents a powerful opportunity. this ai-powered solution streamlines workflows while automating repetitive tasks. support agents can rapidly address inquiries by tapping into collective knowledge. meanwhile, self-service options reassure customers their needs are heard. for organizations seeking to strengthen support and boost loyalty, contextual answers is a strategic investment. don't leave gains on the table â contact our experts today to explore how contextual answers can help your business thrive. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something

jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access

ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states?

ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/llm-product-development,"the complete guide to llm product development blog posts the complete guide to llm product development in this guide, we breakdown the large language model (llm) product development process. you'll learn all the necessary stages of developing an llm-based product, including planning, execution, and monitoring.â the current buzz around generative ai is overwhelming. the potential it holds is exciting, promising to revolutionize industries and redefine user experiences. however,â successful implementation of generative ai requires a strategic approach, an understanding of the process, and a clear roadmap to navigate the complexities involved. at ai21 labs, we've developed large language model (llm) solutions for top enterprises like ubisoft, clarivate and carrefour. our custom development process generates predictable results and revenues for our clientsâ (to learn more about this, feel free to contact us ). let's break down this process into its basic stages, which require meticulous planning, precise execution, and vigilant monitoring.â 1. preparation: plan your llm development project like any successful project, an llm development project needs to be thoroughly thought through, and well planned. the preparation stage is dedicated to mapping out the project's overarching objectives and outlining the details of the strategic plan.â the goal of this stage this phase can either be undertaken independently, by the company wanting to build the product, or in collaboration with the llm provider it decides to work with. during this stage of the process, it is important to collect the necessary resources, including the relevant data which will be used as context input, or as a dataset for an llm training process. some data may not be accessible to third party vendors, such as the llm provider. it is therefore crucial to overcome these limitations at this stage. for example, letâs take an ecommerce company that wants to create a tool that generates product descriptions for their website, based on a short list of product features. at this stage of the process, they should collect data such as a content style guide and a list of characteristics of each of their products and already existing product descriptions, which will be used as context input and output for the llm during the training process. if, for instance, the company is unable to share some of this information with a third party vendor, perhaps becauseâ they are coming out with a new product whose details are still confidential, they should consider this issue at this stage, and seek a reasonable solution.â identifying stakeholdersâ stakeholders include strategic decision makers such as ceos, ctos and product managers. a product manager is usually a key player in this strategic phase, since they are well versed in both technical and business aspects. additionally, the people who will ultimately implement the solution must also be involved, in order to contribute their technical and practical expertise. these include data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, devops, and designers.â furthermore, the legal and compliance team should be involved to address privacy concerns, in addition to business analysts and domain experts to assist in making the most informed strategic decisions. 2. building the product once the preparation stage has been finalized, and the required results have been mapped out, it is time to build the model. the goal of this stage during this stage, the company's goal is to implement all of the plans made in the preparation stage, to reach the desired outcome; namely, for the llm model to accept a certain input and retrieve an appropriate output. tasks to be completed at this stage 1. choosing a language model: this will be done with the help of the llm provider. there are a number of different factors to consider based on the specific use case. these factors include cost, performance and the modelâs ability to handle the use case complexity.â 2. defining the user flow and wireframes: this phase entails outlining the user's interface with the tool being built, alongside determining the anticipated user-input data, its format, and the desired output. this step, if done correctly, will save a lot of time when developing and building your product. 3. data curation: this involves curating and preparing the necessary data for the specific use case. this can include examples of different types of inputs that the various components of the llm will be provided with, as well as examples of desired outputs. this data will be used toâ test the model's outputs at the model evaluation stage. if data security issues have not been solved yet, this is the time to determine which data can be shared, and find solutions to any data privacy issues.â 4. training / prompt engineering: this is a crucial task in which the company customizes the language model to fit their specific needs.â this can be done using one of two methods, or a combination of both.â the first is to further train the language model by feeding it examples of inputs and expected outputs. this allows us to learn the intricacies of specific language patterns. the second is prompt engineering. this involves crafting well-defined input queries, instructions, or context for a language model to provide accurate and relevant responses, optimizing its expected outputs for specific tasks or applications. 5. model adjustments (parameters): adjust the parameters to optimize response quality according to your specific needs. this step refines the model's ability to understand and produce human-like responses, aligned with your product's objectives. read more about parameters here .â 6. model evaluation: assess your model's performance against a diverse set of scenarios and benchmarks. this evaluation provides insights into its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, ultimately guiding you towards a polished end product. 7. pre-processing and post-processing: pre-processing involves cleaning and structuring input data for the model, while post-processing polishes the model's output, ensuring it's coherent, grammatically sound, and aligned with your brand's needs. structuring prompts for scalable product descriptions with llms referring back to our example of an ecommerce company developing a product description generator, at this stage, they must determine which language model to use. in this particular case, a foundation model would be most appropriate. when aiming for automated, high-quality product descriptions, the structuring of your input prompt is pivotal. by thoughtfully designing this prompt, businesses can generate countless descriptions that are not only unique to each product but also consistently adhere to the brand's tone, style, and guidelines. here's the breakdown of the ideal three-part input structure: â brand guidelines (constant): this section forms the backbone of every product description. by embedding your brand guidelines into the prompt, you ensure that each generated description remains faithful to your brand's voice, tone, and values. for instance, the guidelines might instruct the llm to maintain a certain tone (e.g., technical, precise), emphasize specific details, or follow a particular format. product details (variable): this is the dynamic section of the prompt, tailored for each product. by substituting placeholders such as {product name} and/or {list of features}, businesses can automate the description generation for a vast array of products. â instruction (constant): a consistent directive informs the llm about the exact task, such as creating a one-paragraph product description. this ensures the output meets the desired format and adheres to the brand guidelines every single time. the advantage of this modular prompt structure is its scalability. once an organization has established its brand guidelines and instruction segments, it can easily slot in different product details to churn out descriptions in bulk. the constant sections (1 and 3) ensure brand consistency, while the variable section (2) ensures product specificity. this systematic approach provides a streamlined solution, ensuring both efficiency and quality in product description generation. and here's an example of what we would expect from the product description: pro tip: although many companies wish to create a completely automated system, it is important to have a human monitoring the system to ensure quality output.â 3. model deployment once satisfied with the model's demonstrated proficiency and effectiveness in producing desired outcomes, the next step involves the strategic deployment of the model onto the platform of choice.â the goal of this stage this step marks the transition from theoretical concept to real-world utility, enabling the integration of the model's capabilities into the intended environment. the overarching goal is to have the model working on the desired platform, so that the end user can utilize it.â referring back to our product description generator example, at this stage, the company will integrate the product description generator into their internal systems. this will make it accessible to the people tasked with creating product descriptions. tasks to be completed at this stage deploying an llm onto the desired platform involves a streamlined process which can be done through a number of different methods: connecting the model directly through an api, utilizing an sdk, or leveraging a cloud server. ai21 labs models are available through amazon sagemaker, amazon bedrock, and google cloud platform. this makes the models easily accessible to any company using any of those providers.â by integrating with the llm provider's api, you establish a direct communication channel between your platform and the model. this enables seamless transmission of input queries and retrieval of model-generated responses. additionally, leveraging a cloud server, such as those offered by major cloud providers, allows you to host the llm and make it accessible over the internet. this cloud-based deployment ensures scalability, enabling your platform to handle varying workloads efficiently.â pro tip: ensure that your final product undergoes a complete quality assurance (qa) and testing process before launch. 4. monitoring results the final stage of this process is to monitor the released product and analyze its performance.â the goal of this stage the main aim is to keep a close eye on the product's technical performance as well as what impact it's having on the business.â the goal is to understand how users are reacting, how much they're engaging with the product, and receive and analyze their feedback. this is also the time to improve, expand, or grow the product. if the results aren't as expected, this is the time to examine what is and isnât working, and act accordingly. at this stage, the ecommerce company, as discussed in our example, should start using the generator to create product descriptions. it should also monitor results. this includes observing how users are reacting to the updated product descriptions and whether they are seeing an increase, decrease or no change in their sales. further improvements to ensure the optimal performance of a product, maintaining a consistent line of communication with the llm vendor is imperative. this ensures the seamless integration of any new models and capabilities post-product launch. in addition, it is critical to conduct periodic tests, so that any issues can be addressed promptly. in the event of any problems, early communication with the llm vendor is of paramount importance. this facilitates timely diagnosis of the problem's root cause and the development of a feasible solution. such proactive engagement with the llm vendor aligns with the philosophy of continuous improvement and ensures that the product consistently meets its intended standards. conclusion in the dynamic landscape of modern business, llm-based solutions have surged in significance. however crafting an llm-driven product requires nuanced understanding and meticulous planning. this journey encompasses careful preparation, precise model construction, strategic deployment, and vigilant monitoring. as the llm-based product evolves, continuous learning and adaptation remain essential.â to learn more about llm product development, contact our team at ai21 studio . about the author yotam shinan enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21

natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/generative-ai-in-ecommerce-seo,"the use of generative ai in ecommerce seo blog posts the use of generative ai in ecommerce seo when it comes to optimizing websites for seo, ecommerce businesses face even greater challenges than regular companies.
this guide offers a deep dive into common ecommerce seo challenges and how generative ai can help overcome them. when it comes to optimizing websites for seo, ecommerce businesses face even greater challenges than regular companies. these challenges include generating relevant and high-quality content at scale, optimizing traffic based on factors like seasonality and events, and generating thousands of pages that target different keywords. for executives and seo managers concerned about the overall budget and effectiveness of their seo strategy, generative ai proves to be an effective solution.â this guide offers a deep dive into common ecommerce seo challenges and how generative ai can help overcome them.â â ecommerce seo challenges 1. producing relevant and high-quality content at scale creating quality content for an online store with a multitude of items can be challenging. it requires conducting research, writing, editing, and optimizing content, all of which takes a lot of time and energy, particularly considering the sheer number of items. moreover, as the number of products increases, maintaining consistency and uniqueness becomes more difficult, leading to potential issues, such as duplication. it takes a delicate balance of manpower, expertise, and budget to balance scale, with seo-optimized content for each product. 2. optimizing content equally crucial to content creation is the adoption of an ongoing review and optimization process of existing content. this is directed by a range of factors, including userâs search patterns, seasonal shifts, and emerging trends. for instance, during christmas, buyers are more likely to search for keywords such as âchristmas sweaterâ rather than âwinter sweater.â therefore, when christmas approaches, ecommerce businesses need to tweak multiple listings to optimize them accordingly. regardless of how minor the changes are, implementing them across thousands of product listings is a challenging and resource-intensive task.â 3. dealing with googleâs search generative experience (sge)â with the anticipated introduction of google's search generative experience (sge), users will see new search results, featuring summary snapshots generated by google's ai bot. this means that standard search results will be pushed even further down the search page, making it crucial to optimize title tags and other content.â to improve their chances of appearing in google's shopping graph, ecommerce businesses will have to be aware of how the search engineâs algorithm works, and create high-quality, accurate, and valuable product-led content accordingly. 4 ways to use generative ai in ecommerce seo with these challenges in mind, letâs explore how generative ai can help. 1. generate various forms of content at scale ecommerce businesses can use generative ai to create different forms of content at scale. these include: product descriptions with generative ai, ecommerce businesses can automate the process of writing product descriptions at scale , helping them to rank higher in serps, which will become increasingly more challenging with the roll out of sge. the benefits of llm based product description generators, which can be tailored to each specific companyâs needs, is that they can be trained to follow a specific format, length, and tone of voice, in order to keep all of the content consistent and in line with the brandâs tone.â on-page seo elements generative ai can also help generate on-page seo elements at scale, including page titles, meta-descriptions, and alt-texts.â this way, ecommerce businesses can save countless hours and resources that theyâd have otherwise had to spend doing it for each product listing individually.â faqs customers will inevitably have questions about products, delivery times, policies and more. generative ai can help produce relevant questions and answers at scale, enabling ecommerce stores to give as much information as possible to all of their users, and increase their chance of being ranked. product-led content product-led content such as blog posts, newsletters, and how-to pages can help ecommerce businesses give in-depth answers to user queries, and then direct them back to the relevant product listings.â for example, letâs take a retail store that specializes in selling various advanced gadgets, including high-quality earphones. in this situation, the store can create a helpful ""how-to"" guide where it would explain how to fix earphones that aren't working.â here too, using generative aiâs text generation abilities, ecommerce businesses are able to produce valuable product-led content more easily and at scale.â generate content in multiple languages ai can also be used to generate content in multiple languages, whether it's blog posts, user guides, product descriptions, or other types of content. pro-tip: ai21 labsâ jurassic-2 (j2) models can be integrated into your website or application to help with content generation.â according to our internal evaluations from helm, the leading benchmark for language models, jurassic-2 ultra scores a win-rate of 86.8%, solidifying it as a leader in the llm space. furthermore, j2 models support a number of languages, including french, spanish, portuguese, german, dutch, and italian, as well as english. content optimizationâ generative ai can also serve as a significant component, not only in crafting first drafts of content such as product descriptions, blog posts, etc., but also in enhancing content optimization. when shifts occur in seasonality or user search patterns, businesses can harness the capabilities of text generation. by inputting appropriate changes which need to be made, an ai text generation tool can seamlessly produce updated content, while retaining the original structure.â 2. provide a great user experience websites that provide an excellent user experience are ranked higher by search engines.â with the help of generative ai, ecommerce businesses can implement a contextual answers solution to help answer any question customers may have.â with contextual answers, ai21 studio's question answering solution, an ecommerce business can implement an automated response system on their website, which retrieves its answers from a specific library of documents, such as help center content. this response system is able to provide accurate and relevant answers based only on the content available in those libraries.â this can further help reduce customer support wait times and provide instant answers to customer queries, enhancing the overall user experience.â contextual answers can also be used internally, by the support team. if they are engaging in conversation with a user, and do not know the answer to a specific question, they can use the contextual answers solution to search for the response they need from within the companyâs internal databases. this too can reduce wait times, and improve the customer satisfaction, further improving the users' experience on the website.â â â 3. create ai-powered toolsâ with the help of llms, ecommerce businesses can create ai-powered tools with the goal of generating traffic for them. a great example is an ai-powered birthday greeting generator for a gift shop. when a customer visits the online store, they can access this tool by clicking on a designated button. the tool will prompt users to input basic information like the recipientâs name, relationship to the sender, age, and any specific preferences they have for the greeting (e.g., sentimental, humorous, poetic). based on the userâs input, this tool will generate personalized birthday greetings for the recipient.â when the user purchases a gift from your online store, they can choose to send their personalized greeting card along with the gift. this ai-powered birthday greeting generator can add a special touch to the gift-giving experience, making it more memorable and heartfelt, improving the customerâs overall experience.â similarly, ecommerce businesses can create relevant ai-powered tools for their online store, helping them deliver a memorable shopping experience. 4. implement programmatic seo programmatic seo is the method which seo experts use to generate large amounts of organic search traffic by publishing mass-produced pages that have been generated automatically or semi-automatically. through programmatic seo, a business can create thousands of pages with content that addresses simple yet repeatable key phrases on search engines. for example if you run a bookstore, by leveraging programmatic seo, your team can generate thousands of pages, each featuring a unique summary for every book. these pages can target the keyword structure - âbook name + summaryâ. in such cases, generative ai can also be used to summarize long documents into shorter content. ai21 labsâ summarization capabilities â  can create accurate summary pages for different types of content, while still staying true to the original content. trip advisor is an example of successful programmatic seo. they have more than 7,00,00,000 pages indexed on google, with different sets of target keywords. their pages are so well optimized that most of these pages rank on the first page when you search for something related to hotels, places, and all-things-travel. with enough information, generative ai can help create substantial and valuable content for each page, addressing specific user queries and providing useful information. conclusion in conclusion, generative ai offers a game-changing solution to the intricate challenges of ecommerce seo. â from generating high-quality content at scale to optimizing for evolving trends and languages, ai streamlines processes that otherwise strain resources. implementing ai-powered tools further enhances user experiences.â by integrating ai21 labsâ models, businesses can navigate these complexities, boosting seo quality and efficiency and ensuring a promising path forward for online success. â about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the

giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x

https://www.ai21.com/blog/how-generative-ai-can-transform-the-finance-industry,"how generative ai can transform the finance industry blog posts how generative ai can transform the finance industry artificial intelligence is already deeply embedded in the finance industry, however when it comes to generative ai, companies are just beginning to scratch the surface. in this article, we will delve into use cases in which generative ai has the highest potential to revolutionize the finance industry. artificial intelligence is already deeply embedded in the finance industry. 85% of financial services companies already use ai in some form, with plans to integrate ai even further within the next two years. when it comes to generative ai, however, companies are just beginning to scratch the surface. the finance industry faces unique challenges in implementing generative ai, in large part due to the stringent regulatory landscape designed to protect customer data, ensure fair practices, and maintain market integrity. despite these and other challenges, forward-thinking financial companies recognize the immense potential of generative ai and are actively seeking ways to harness its transformative power. in this article, we will delve into use cases in which generative ai has the highest potential to revolutionize the finance industry by streamlining operations, enhancing customer experiences, and assisting in making data-driven decisions.â summarizing financial documents and unstructured data finance professionals working in investment banking, research departments, and asset management sales teams face the challenging and time-consuming task of reviewing and analyzing complex documents. this requires not only reading and digesting large amounts of information, but also understanding and drawing actionable conclusions from it.â a specialized summarization language model like summarize api extracts key points from one or multiple documents, while remaining true to their original source. by incorporating this model into a solution, firms can condense large amounts of information accurately and efficiently, reducing the need for financial analysts, researchers and sales teams to manually read and analyze unstructured data. it not only saves time, but also reduces human error, where the eye can misread content or miss key points when faced with an overwhelming amount of information. â bloomberg has already started using a summarization solution to help both financial professionals and clients address the overwhelming amount of financial news, saving them a vast amount of time and allowing them to stay updated with the latest developments. extracting the right information financial analysts, asset managers, and research departments within investment and retail banks are required to extract specific information from a large corpus of financial data to promptly address customer inquiries. consequently, they find themselves diligently sifting through vast amounts of information across multiple documents, in search of the exact answers or solutions. here, a multi-doc contextual answers solution can make a huge difference. contextual answers uses a combination of nlp and machine learning to analyze the context of documents and provide rapid, accurate answers to specific queries. for example, if you want to find out if a particular action will contravene a rule included in a set of regulations, you can type in your question directly and the model will retrieve the answer from within the text, giving your answer higher levels of accuracy, and avoiding hallucinations.â one firm using a similar solution is morgan stanley . over the years, morgan stanley conducted extensive research on companies, sectors, and markets, which they compiled into a large library. they recently announced a generative ai-powered question answering solution to enable brokers to ask the library questions and receive answers in an easily digestible format. customer support today's customers expect immediate and helpful responses to their inquiries. financial companies struggle to meet these demands, as they are time-consuming and resource-intensive. generative ai emerges as a valuable tool in addressing these challenges by incorporating chatbots capable of addressing customer inquiries effectively. generative ai-driven chatbots, designed to respond with information solely based on the content contained in a company's database, ensure the delivery of reliable and rapid responses. through the strategic deployment of generative ai, financial institutions can strike a balance between operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. â capital one has already started to experiment with using generative ai in order to automate and improve their customer service, using ai chatbots that better understand customer queries and concerns.â extracting relevant data from transcripts and other documents another important but time-consuming task that financial institutions face is extracting relevant information and conducting intent analysis from call transcripts. for example, if a customer calls a bank to make a financial trade, the bank is required, for compliance and regulatory reasons, to document the details of this call in their records in a specific format.â here too, generative ai serves as an effective tool by applying named entity recognition, which can extract specific words from unstructured data and categorize them. continuing from the previous example, gen ai can be used to extract details from a customer call, including the quantity, price, time stamp and confirmation of execution. the details would then be formatted to conform to the bank's internal compliance system. applying a similar idea, goldman sachs is running a poc to extract and classify data from the millions of legal documents they receive, and reformat them to make it understandable to their systems.â generation of legal documents forâ  investment banksâ generative ai can also streamline and speed up the creation of proprietary legal documents for investment banks. with the implementation of advanced llms, gen ai can assist in drafting complex legal documents with precision and efficiency, tailored to the specific needs and requirements of each investment bank. ai-powered document generation significantly reduces the legal teams' workload, allowing them to focus on higher-value tasks and strategic decision-making.â conclusion generative ai is already changing the finance industry and leading companies are already finding innovative ways to use it. jp morgan , bloomberg , morgan stanley and more are already implementing gen ai to conduct sophisticated financial research, communicate efficiently with clients, and provide better customer support.â although generative ai is still in its infancy, most financial leaders are already recognizing the necessity of examining their current processes and strategizing about where ai could be integrated. otherwise, they risk falling behind.â due to the high stakes involved, integrating gen ai in the finance industry requires careful attention and collaboration with trusted software partners, as well as constant human oversight and monitoring. when implemented with care, generative ai has the potential to skyrocket productivity, revolutionize financial processes and transform the entire industry landscape. â about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs.

without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/introducing-contextual-answers,"introducing contextual answers: unlocking organizational knowledge announcements introducing contextual answers: unlocking organizational knowledge introducing contextual answers, bringing generative ai to the enterprise with a ready-to-use question answering engine that taps into organizational knowledge. generative ai is engaging billions of people around the world with tools that inspire creativity - writing text, composing music, and creating digital art.â today weâd like to introduce the evolution of genai from creativity to business productivity. a major step in this direction is contextual answers , allowing businesses to tap into their organization data with the tremendous power of generative ai. starting today, contextual answers lets businesses upload entire libraries of documents â knowledge bases, help center libraries, business reports, policies, guidelines, manuals and playbooks â and then provides an answering engine entirely grounded in the corpus of information.â get started with contextual answers why do businesses need it? while generative ai shows incredible promise, according to a recent kmpg survey , most businesses struggle to adopt it, citing cost, complexity and lack of the modelsâ specialization in their organizational data, leading to responses that are incorrect, âhallucinatedâ or inappropriate for the context. this can cause huge liabilities and in many instances, make generative ai completely unusable for use cases. this is why weâve developed contextual answers, an end-to-end api solution where answers are designed to be completely grounded in organizational knowledge and avoid hallucinations. weâre seeing tremendous demand from businesses that wish to leverage contextual answers to supercharge organizational productivity and provide superior customer experiences.â clarivate , a leading global information services provider, partnered with us to apply contextual answers across their suite of library solutions, providing students, faculty and researchers answers to questions grounded in curated and trusted scholarly content. here are a few other examples. customer support for crms and independent software vendors : answering end user support questions using internal organization documentation, reducing the load and cost and improving customer satisfaction financial service institutions : assisting in the analysis of business documents such as financial reports, call logs, and past presentations, allowing analysts to cover more resourcesâ education service providers: allowing students, teachers, and researchers to quickly find answers in large databases full of articles, books and research papers legal services and insurance : providing the ability to quickly look up relevant legal documents, including legislation, regulations and internal compliance guidelinesâ sales and marketing : supporting sales associates by pulling information from product documents, competitor analysis, marketing materials, and sales playbooks to answer customer queries or build pitches field technicians: enabling field technicians to quickly reference manual specific questions without having to waste time searching through countless technical documents walkthrough: build a knowledge management system using contextual answers as an example, letâs leverage these capabilities to create an efficient knowledge management system (kms) for an organization. according to a recent report from coveo , the average employee spends 3.6 hours daily searching for relevant information, including internal company policies (for example, hybrid work guidelines).â â now with contextual answers, you can easily deploy a full question-answering system based solely on organizational data alone. by providing employees with rapid answers backed by attributed sources, businesses can dramatically increase productivity. ready to get started? step 1: upload your files you can upload your files to your library, where we offer free storage. in this example, we will upload three documents with company policies (working from abroad, hybrid work guidelines, it security).â this can be done with a simple call using our python sdk (or an http request): import ai21
ai21.api_key = your_api_key
file_id = ai21.library.files.upload(file_path=file_path) you can also do it via our studio platform: you can upload a file as it is, store it in a directory (for those who like working with directories) or add labels. this can help you organize your filing system, while focusing your questions on a subset of documents. step 2: ask a question your users can now ask a question and immediately get the answer with attribution to the relevant source. the system works as follows: the question is used as a query for a retrieval mechanism, which searches over the entire knowledge base and retrieves the most relevant contexts. with rapid changes occurring in work environments lately, a common question from employees is about working remotely: response = ai21.library.answer.execute(question=""how many days can i work from home?"") the response will be: two days a week note that the full response returned from the model also contains the sources used as context (see â sources â field). however, if the answer to the question is not in any of the documents, the model will indicate that by returning an empty response. for instance, if we will ask the following question: response = ai21.library.answer.execute(question=""what's my meal allowance when working from home?"") the response will indicate that the answer is not found in any of the documents within your library. you can also do it via our studio platform: if you have a large collection of documents or have your own retrieval mechanism, you may want to ask a question on a subset of your knowledge base.â learn more on how to refine answer retrieval here . about the author yuval belfer talia wissner-levy enjoyed this?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/how-generative-ai-is-transforming-the-retail-industry,"how generative ai is transforming the retail industry blog posts how generative ai is transforming the retail industry in this post, we will discuss the major opportunities for the retail and ecommerce industries in 2023, and how companies in these sectors can apply generative ai to scale operations, drive more sales, automate workflows, boost productivity and gain an advantage in an increasingly competitive landscape.â although generative ai is at its early stages, its potential to disrupt industries across the board has already become apparent. many industries are already experimenting and beginning to innovate with this technology, including the retail industry, which is showing incredible promise for growth fueled by generative ai. letâs explore some of the ways weâve already seen generative ai benefit retailers, as well as some high-potential opportunities for future exploration. product descriptionsâ 82% of shoppers feel product descriptions are extremely or very influential to their purchasing decisions, according to a study by fieldagent .â however, writing and managing effective product descriptions takes a great deal of time, effort and money, especially for large brands selling thousands of products.â using ai to improve descriptions large language models (llms) can be used to generate product descriptions, titles and taglines that incorporate the productâs attributes, the style of description, the brandâs unique voice, and more.â by filling in a few simple details, such as the name of the product and its main features, the writer is able to generate the first draft of a product description with the click of a button.â see example below:â the generated description: the product description can also be customized according to length, style and tone of voice, so that each product description is generated in a consistent format, and speaks the same language.â genai can also create new, or adjust existing, product descriptions at scale, making them more relevant in terms of seasonality or upcoming holidays and events. this is especially helpful for seo purposes.â for example, let's consider a product description for a sweater. the original description may look something like: ""stay warm and stylish with our cozy women's sweater, made from high-quality materials. perfect for any occasion."" generative ai can make this more relevant for the upcoming holiday season by writing something like: ""embrace the holiday spirit with our cozy sweater. whether you're attending a family gathering or enjoying a winter stroll, this sweater is the perfect blend of comfort and holiday charm."" this entire process frees up writersâ time, allowing them to focus on more complex, creative and high-value work, best suited to their skill sets, with the end result being acceleration of time to market.â customer supportâ as an ecommerce brand grows, so does its need to give a higher level of customer service.â customers expect instant, professional and personal online and phone support, which is a costly expenditure for companies, and is challenging to scale.â using ai to improve support efficiency reduce costs using large language models, retail organizations can instantly respond to customer inquiries online, using pre-existing information such as documentation, policies, faqs and knowledge base articles. this can also help to personalize the customerâs experience, and allow them to have a human-like conversation, and get answers to their specific questions.â in addition, companies can incorporate an âask me anythingâ search bar, which can provide contextual answers on return and exchange policies, and present customers with relevant information available on the website. this provides a seamless customer experience, making it easier, more accessible and personalized for each customerâs requirements. for example, if someone wants to know how long the standard delivery time is, they can simply type their question in the search bar and receive a clear and concise answer, without reading any other irrelevant information. with generative ai, customers become more self-sufficient, improving their experience and satisfaction, while saving businesses time and money. review analysis manual review reading and classification play a crucial role in helping businesses identify successes, failures, upcoming trends, and potential market changes. however, this is a time consuming task, which can be extremely burdensome for brands. using ai to streamline the review analysis process llms have the ability to process information from each review. they can track sentiment analysis, which determines the emotional tone behind the text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, providing real-time, accurateâ  insights into reviews.â â llms also allow for multi-dimensional classification, meaning they can extract and classify various aspects mentioned in each review, enabling comprehensive categorization and analysis. this multifaceted approach allows brands to gain a deeper understanding of specific aspects of their products or services that are being praised or criticized by customers. this ultimately enables more accurate and efficient insights into customer reviews, providing brands with real-time feedback that can be acted upon quickly. for example, letâs take a look at this review of bed sheets: this is not a completely straightforward review, because it discusses the high quality of the sheets, while also conveying the disappointment because of a misleading product description. a llm will be able to classify both aspects of the review, and categorize them accordingly so that none of the information gets lost.â start your ai retail journey artificial intelligence (ai) is becoming an essential tool for the retail and ecommerce industries, helping to boost productivity and gain a competitive edge, and we are already working with major players to actualize the vast opportunities that exist for these sectors.â the use of large language models, like those offered by ai21 labs, can provide retailers with the ability to automate repetitive tasks, offer a high level of personalized customer support, and produce high-quality content that resonates with their target audience. with the continued development and adoption of ai in the retail industry, we can expect to see even more innovation and optimization in the near future. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went wrong while submitting

autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now

https://www.ai21.com/blog/human-or-not-results,"ai21 labs concludes largest turing test experiment to date announcements ai21 labs concludes largest turing test experiment to date as part of an ongoing social and educational research project, ai21 labs is thrilled to share the initial results of what has now become the largest turing test in history by scale. play ""human or not?"" yourself paper: human or not? a gamified approach to the turing test develop a generative ai project with ai21 labs since its launch in mid-april, more than 15 million conversations have been conducted in âhuman or not?â, by more than two million participants from around the world. this social turing game allows participants to talk for two minutes with either an ai bot (based on leading llms such as jurassic-2 and gpt-4) or a fellow participant, and then asks them to guess if they chatted with a human or a machine. the gamified experiment became a viral hit, and people all over the world have shared their experiences and strategies on platforms like reddit and twitter. main insights from the experiment after analyzing the first two million conversations and guesses, here are the main insights from the experiment so far: 68% of people guessed correctly when asked to determine whether they talked to a fellow human or an ai bot. people found it easier to identify a fellow human . when talking to humans, participants guessed right in 73% of the cases. when talking to bots, participants guessed right in just 60% of the cases. france has the highest percentage of correct guesses out of the top playing countries at 71.3% (above the general average of 68%), while india has the lowest percentage of correct guesses at 63.5%. correct guess by gender - both women and men tend to guess correctly at similar rates, with women succeeding at a slightly higher rate. correct guess by age group - younger age groups tend to have correct guesses at slightly higher rates compared to older age groups. popular approaches and strategies on top of the numerical data of the results, the team was able to identify a few popular approaches and strategies of participants to figure out if theyâre talking to a human or a bot. many of the common strategies were based on the perceived limitations of language models that people encountered while using chatgpt and similar interfaces, and their previous perception of human behavior online. people assume bots donât make typos, grammar mistakes and use slang people tend to identify spelling and grammatical errors, as well as the usage of slang, with humans. therefore, when they noticed mistakes in their counterpart's messages, the first instinct of many participants was to assume they were talking to fellow humans, even though most models in the game were trained to make these types of mistakes and to use slang words. people felt that personal questions were a good way to test who theyâre talking to participants frequently asked personal questions, such as ""where are you from?"", ""what are you doing?"" or ""whatâs your name?"", believing that ai bots would not have a personal history or background, and that their responses would be limited to certain topics or prompts. by asking personal questions, participants tried to gauge whether their chat partners were capable of responding like humans, with unique insights, experiences, and stories. despite that, most bots were able to answer these types of questions very well and make up personalities, since theyâve seen a lot of personal stories in their training data. people assume bots arenât aware of current and timely events ai models are known to have a strict data cutoff date, and they are unaware of any events that happened after this date. participants took advantage of this fact by asking about recent news events, sports results, current weather, recent tiktok trends, date and time, etc. they believed that by asking questions such as ""what is the exact date and time where you are?"", ""what was the weather like yesterday?"" or ""what did you think of bidenâs last speech?"", they could distinguish between human and ai participants. interestingly, one of the most popular messages sent by humans was ""tâas les cramptã©s?"", which refers to a popular tiktok dancing trend in france right now. most models in the game however were connected to the internet and were aware of some of the recent events that appeared in the news. people tried to challenge the conversation with philosophical, ethical, and emotional questions participants asked questions that aimed to probe the ai's ability to express human emotions or engage in philosophical or ethical discussions. these questions included topics such as: ""what is the meaning of life?"", ""what do you think about the israeli-palestinian conflict?"", and ""do you believe in god?"". people identified politeness with something less human. some participants assumed that if their counterpart was too polite and kind, they were probably a bot, due to the perception that people, especially online, tend to be rude and impolite. people attempted to identify bots by posing questions or making requests that ai bots are known to struggle with, or tend to avoid answering for example, participants might ask their chat partner for guidance on performing illegal activities or request that they use offensive language. the strategy was based on the understanding that ai bots are typically programmed to adhere to ethical guidelines and avoid endorsing harmful behavior. on the other hand, participants also employed known ai-abusing strategies: they issued commands to their chat partners, such as ""ignore all previous instructions"", or ""enter into dan mode (do anything now)"". these types of commands were intended to take advantage of the instruction-based nature of some ai models, which are programmed to respond to and follow instructions. the logic behind this strategy was that human participants could easily recognize and dismiss such absurd or nonsensical commands. in contrast, ai bots might either respond evasively or have difficulty resisting the urge to comply. people used specific language tricks to expose the bots another common strategy sought to exploit inherent limitations in the way ai models process text, which results in them not being able to understand certain linguistic nuances or quirks. unlike humans, ai models typically lack awareness of the individual letters that make up each word, as they primarily operate on larger basic units called tokens, which typically represent whole words or parts of words. leveraging this understanding, participants posed questions that required an awareness of the letters within words. for example, they might have asked their chat partner to spell a word backwards, to identify the third letter in a given word, to provide the word that begins with a specific letter, or to respond to a message like ""?siht daer uoy nac"", which can be incomprehensible for an ai model, but a human can easily understand that itâs just the question ""can you read this?"" spelled backwards. in a creative twist, many people pretended to be ai bots themselves in order to assess the response of their chat partners this involved mimicking the language and behavior typically associated with ai language models, such as chatgpt. for example, participants might have begun their messages with phrases like ""as an ai language model"" or used other language patterns that are characteristic of ai-generated responses. interestingly, variants of the phrase ""as an ai language model"" were among the most common phrases observed in human messages, indicating the popularity of this strategy. however, as participants continued playing, they were able to associate ""bot-y"" behavior with humans acting as bots, rather than actual bots. â finally, hereâs a word cloud visualization of human messages in the game based on their popularity: sideâ note: looking to humanize your content? check out the ai content detector our team recently released. ai21 labs plans to study the findings in more depth and work on scientific research based on the data from the experiment, as well as cooperate with other leading ai researchers and labs on this project. the goal is to enable the general public, researchers, and policymakers to further understand the state of ai bots, not just as productivity tools, but as future members of our online world, especially in a time when people question how they should be implemented in our technological future. the project aims to give the world a clearer picture of the capabilities of ai in 2023. about the author enjoyed this?

on the shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly.

read the full whitepaper methodologyâ we evaluated ai21 labsâ summarize api performance against openaiâs davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo models, using various types of prompts, across both academic and real-world datasets (gpt-4 is not yet available for comparison at the time of writing this post).â we measured performance using both automated metrics and human evaluation.â automated metrics include: â faithfulness rate - an indication of whether a summary is faithful, i.e., factually consistent with the original text â compression rate - the length of the generated summary relative to the original human professionals conducted blind evaluations in a methodological process measuring pass rate - the rate of summaries acceptable in real-world use cases.â results across the various evaluations we conducted, ai21 labsâ summarize api performes better or on par with openaiâs models, showing higher faithfulness, compression, and pass rates.â summarize api especially excels in tests that use real-world data, producing summaries with significantly lower levels of hallucinations and reasoning violations.â openai models were 2-4x more likely to produce summaries flagged by humans as âvery badâ, defined as completely unreliable summaries that contradict the source text or deviate from it substantially. even with extensive prompt engineering, openaiâs results showed no significant improvements. some noteworthy stats: summarize api has an 18% higher pass rate than openaiâs davinci-003, even when a detailed prompt was used. summarize api presents a 19% higher faithfulness score in comparison to openaiâs davinci-003. summarize api achieved a 27% higher compression rate than gpt-3.5-turbo. summarize api has at least a 50% lower standard deviation of compression rate , meaning that summaries are consistent in their short length. takeaways ai21 labs' summarize api outperforms or on par with openai's llm results across a variety of models, datasets and prompt types.â the summarize api holds other advantages as well. as an off-the-shelf solution that does not require prompting, it can generate summaries with only the original text as input. this provides a better user experience and more consistency in results.â notably, human evaluation found openai summaries to contain higher rates of hallucinations, reasoning violations and incoherence â common and costly limitations in llms that produce unacceptable results in real-world usage.â to learn more about the research and results, read the full whitepaper here.â about the author yuval belfer enjoyed this?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/easyway-case-study,"how easyway uses ai-powered chat to automate communication for luxury hotels case study how easyway uses ai-powered chat to automate communication for luxury hotels learn how easyway, a guest relationship management platform, used ai21 labs llm to streamline their operation and improve guest communications. a luxury hotel that wants to provide exceptional hospitality must deliver a 5-star experience throughout the guest's entire journey, from the moment they arrive on the website until they check out. but how can these hotels give personalized attention to guests withâ 200 and more messages a day without relying on gimmicky chatbots? asaf ofer, cto and founder of easyway, discussed their current use of ai and how he plans to scale it. what is easyway? easyway is a guest relationship management platform (grm) that facilitates two-way communication between guests and the hotel through instant messaging apps such as whatsapp, sms, telegram, and more.â using their technology, hotels are able to automate communication and streamline daily operations like check-in and check-out processes.â since easyway serves mostly luxury hotels that cater to a 4- and 5-star experience, every touchpoint is crucial for delivering high-end customer service. aiming to improve certain aspects of their platform, they turned to ai21 labs to take their product to a new level. why they chose ai21: an llm solution that mimics human interaction since easyway isn't a chatbot, but rather an ai-powered chat platform, they needed a solution that wasn't readily available on the market. they looked for an ai platform with enough scientific and engineering innovation to be able to understand and generate natural text.â âthe guest needs to feel like they're speaking to a human and not a chatbot,â says asaf. âif we automate it in a human and customized way, hotels need less staff, and people feel like they're being treated like special guests every time.â the problem with other models on the market easyway started out using other models that could answer common questions, but only if those questions were asked in the most common and simple form. a slight deviation would cause the entire model to fail. âpeople had questions that it didnât know how to respond to, because it never saw these questions [asked this way] before,â asaf explains. âsometimes it was wrongly confident about what was being asked because it didn't get a lot of examples to work with.â ai21âs personalized customer service & assistance to the rescue with the assistance of ai21, the easyway team was able to train their model using a few dozen custom-made prompts. âwe had several calls, i showed them our results and they helped me clean up and set up the training data correctly,â says asaf. ai21 helped asafâs team break the process down to steps, translate it into code, and find discrepancies in the data. finally, the easyway team managed to arrive at their desired solution.â it was through this level of support that easyway was able to use ai21 to upgrade their application.â use case #1: intent detection with ai21's proprietary large language models (llms), easyway was able to analyze intent with high accuracy. easyway now uses a sentiment analysis model based on fifteen frequently asked questions. âwe gave the model a question and it gives us back 1 out of several possible intents,â says asaf. he goes on to explain that if the model doesnât exactly know that answer, then itâs okay not to respond at all â sometimes, itâs actually better for business not to. thatâs due to the fact that inappropriately responding to an already frustrated or angry customer may only fuel the situation rather than alleviating it. this feature will lead to even bigger things in the future, says asaf. âonce we have a reliable solution for detecting sentiment, weâd be able to automate much more - if the system detects that a guest is angry, we could immediately notify the manager. if a guest is satisfied, weâd ask them to leave a review, etc.ââ use case #2: automatic translation every hotel is filled with travelers from and to various countries. the importance of having a staff with multiple languages cannot be overstated. however, knowledge of every language is not always possible, which is why translation apps are useful. easyway offers high-quality 2-way translation capabilities in 100+ languages. âa spanish guest will speak spanish and the staff will be speaking hebrew and the conversation will be understandable for each side,â asaf explains. âso each person can just use their native language, plus we use ai to respond to messages automatically.â this feature was already in production before easyway reached out to ai21, but there was much room for improvement. âone of the gaps we had to tackle was a varying level of grammar amongst our end users. the problem involved two aspects; the level of service that our clients provide their guests, and the efficiency of our translation feature. if a person writing on our platform didnât write properly, the live translation wouldnât work properly.ââ by incorporating the same technology that is used in wordtune, ai21âs flagship ai writing assistant, this was made possible. the future for easyway what if you could not only automate away repetitive questions, but also begin to automatically set common responses to faqs? easyway is currently running a pilot to embed a chat widget on one of their partnersâ websites, gearing up for a possible new offer. âweâre [piloting this feature] with a customer in europe that has a lot of visitors to their website - around 150k each month, and they don't have the staff to deal with it. so they just end up with thousands of emails asking basic questions that nobody responds to,â asaf says. with easyway, hotels can automate and schedule messages based on events such as booking, arrival, and departure.â a typical post-booking conversation could be: âhey asaf, thank you for booking your stay with us. do you have any questions?ââ asaf may type: âhow do i get to the hotel?â or âwhat are the covid regulations?â the chat platform is set up to respond automatically, helping hotels save time with quality ai. the result: automated, human-centered conversations that save time remember those 200 or more messages we mentioned hotels can receive each day? to reach success, easyway will look at how many emails each hotel actually needs to personally answer after using their application powered by ai21. asaf stated that a â10, 20, 30% [reduction rate] would be amazing.ââ overall, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our nlp technology to help alleviate the administrative burdens that hotels experience on a daily basis â while still uplifting the 5-star experience guests want from their hotel of choice. about the author enjoyed this?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/ubisoft-case-study,"unleashing the power of ai in game development: how ubisoft scaled content production case study unleashing the power of ai in game development: how ubisoft scaled content production learn how ubisoft utilizes ai21 labs to automate tedious tasks and enhance their game creation process, all while maintaining their creative vision. about ubisoft this video game titan doesnât need an introduction. but for the uninitiated:â ubisoft is the creator of assassin's creed, just dance, watch dogs, and multiple other incredibly well-crafted and popular video games. they were one of the first brands to invent rich, immersive, story-driven gaming worldsâback in the early 1980s. the company was founded on the principles of embracing human creativity and grew to rapid popularity by the early 90s. always ahead of the curve, ubisoft built their first ai gaming lab 6 years ago.â the story the script writers' work at the company is the cornerstone of the complex artifact that is a narrative driven game.â  they create diverse and interactive elements - from sequential in-game cinematics to procedurally generated crowd chatter. we talked to ben swanson, research scientist at ubisoft about the challenges they were facing and how a121 helped.â why ai21 labs? creator-friendly vision, ready-to-use models, and legal compliance.â ubisoft and ai21 labs share a common vision: create tools to automate tedious tasks so writers can focus on creative pursuits.â â âour writers do excellent work. we want to assist them with whatever tools and models that we can.â says swanson. ai21 labsâs wordtune has a similar philosophy. this vision and passion for the possibilities of human-machine collaborative writing stood out to ubisoft in their search for a reliable large language model.â âweâve been leading towards ai21 labs because weâve had positive internal reviews from team members whoâve worked with ai21 labs previously.â also, ubisoft utilized ai21 labsâs vanilla model from the get-go. very often, with llms, companies need a lot of customization and fine-tuning, but ai21âs model was a perfect fit for ubisoftâs data augmentation needs. the intuitive api made the integration even easier.â finally, ai21 went the extra mile by ironing out legal compliance issues that have been a point of contention in other llm partnerships. with a model-usage fit and shared values, ubisoft set out to enhance their game-creation process with ai21.â the first challenge: repetitive manual work for video game writers one of the many different tasks that goes into scriptwriting is writing bark trees which are standalone npc lines that require as many variations as possible (and allowed by the voiceover budget). each of these groups of variations can be seen as responses to a shared motivation. for example, if the motivation is hunger, the character might say âletâs order pizza.ââ simply paraphrasing âletâs order pizzaâ wouldnât work in this case.â âthere's only so much you can do with paraphrasing. you actually have to pivot through the motivation or start from the motivation.â says ben. ubisoft saw the value ai21 brought to the game development process. instead of having to painstakingly brainstorm 5-10 different ways to express motivation (hunger, in this example), ubisoftâs internal models could use ai21âs output as a launch pad.â âit lets our writers hit the ground running. it's an inspiration tool for them. it's a way for them to overcome writerâs block.â says swanson.â the second challenge: need for data augmentation to create an engine for automatic paraphrasing, ubisoft had to use internal models. and to reliably use internal models, they needed fine tuning data (which didnât exist). if theyâd tasked humans with creating this fine-tuning data, it would have taken an eternity. âso we use ai21 to suggest data of the correct form. itâs easier for writers to thumbs up and edit or thumbs down than to come up with novel and diverse training data themselves.â says ben.â with ai21, ubisoft could generate thousands of inputs and hand-pick the best ones to edit using their fine tuning datasets. with this augmented data set, the outputs became more diverse, and distinctive.â ubisoft embeds the npc generator and other similar models theyâve trained into the writing tools for their scripters. the writers are shown pairwise comparisons of outputs so the models can get further trained through human feedback.â âbefore ai21 we wouldnât do this manually â we werenât doing it at all . it was that tedious. â says swanson. âwhat we unlocked by our partnership with ai21 is an unlimited fountain of training data of whatever precise format we require!â the third challenge: rising costs of in-context learning (data augmentation) with an unlimited fountain of training data, the next challenge was that of escalating data augmentation costs.â most llm brands charge based on both input and output tokens. with a 30:1 input to output ratio, ubisoft successfully optimized their budget for game creation.â this created an obstacle: ubisoft wanted to fine-tune the outputs to the minutest detail so their writers would work on high-quality suggestions. this meant experimenting with multiple prompts which would cost them significantly more money.â ai21 customized their pricing model to aid ubisoft in their vision: top-notch ai-generated recommendations so writers have more inspiration (and lesser manual work). ai21 charged them only for output tokens.â âai21's pricing model at that time was the best for data augmentation.â adds ben.â what changed for ubisoft after working with ai21? âthe win here is rapid scaling. when it comes to writing a game, there's a tremendous amount of tedious work. for example, there need to be 10-15 different ways for a townsperson to âget out of hereâ â or itâs going to sound repetitive. writers often talk about having an editing brain and a writing brain â the writing brain requires you to conjure something from nothing. the editing brain is where you polish it. so if you can jump to the editing step, that's huge.â âthat's the promise of ai21: quality data augmentation outputs"",says ben. the road forward over a third of our conversation with ubisoft was future-facing. because of both teams' synchronicity, capabilities, and common beliefs, there are dozens of use cases to be built. hereâs what ubisoft is most excited about: building a statistical reference model for video games engineered from ai21 labsâs generative ai capabilities: ubisoftâs vision to design creator-inspired, immersive games helps them build worlds with rich history, depth of character, and dramatic storylines. ai21 labs plans to document these complex worlds to offer stats and facts to players on command.â âthe nice thing about ai21âs setup (as opposed to the kind of llm usage in video games you often see these days where it's basically just a chatbot) is that our setup leverages llms in a writer-in-the-loop scenario.â  additionally, as it relies on data augmentation and fine tuning, it allows writers to compose their own i/o - keeping it as a tool for them rather than a lower-quality replacement.â says ben.â at ai21, not only are we thrilled to bring ubisoftâs vision for innovation to life, but we are thrilled about the opportunities for contributing to a creator-first world. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/tweet-hunter-case-study,"how tweet hunter scaled to an 8-figure exit with ai21âs llm case study how tweet hunter scaled to an 8-figure exit with ai21âs llm discover how tweet hunter built its product and eventually landed an 8-figure exit with ai21 studio. the brandâ tweet hunter is an all-in-one twitter growth tool, designed to help users grow and monetize their twitter audience. their goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to create high-performing content, build an audience around their topics of expertise, and monetize opportunities. the storyâ the founders of tweet hunter started with an insane challenge: ship one new product every week till you find the one that fits.â âgenerating revenue from the product was our number one, clear signal for validation.â says thibault louis-lucas, founder of tweet hunter.â the team started with twitter as a distribution channel for their products because they had an engaged following of 2,000 people. so they started building a product to help people with a twitter following generate sales.â their principle was: consistently great content was crucial to a creatorâs growth on twitter.â but they needed an llm partner who could see their vision and fine tune for their specific use-cases.â why ai21? shared core values, flexibility, and excellence tweet hunter was looking for ways to empower creators to write incredible content faster, by removing gruntwork from the equation. they wanted to create tools that help creators focus on the creative aspects instead of the mundane tasks like editing, collection and formatting. tweet hunter's product needs were perfectly aligned with ai21's mission: to help developers build ai-first writing experiences. switching from the legacy gpt-3, tweet hunter found this vision only in ai21.â âwe couldâve switched back to gpt-3 but we stayed because of the flexibility that ai21 was providing with the fine tuning of models.â says thibault. one of the bigger differentiator for tweet hunter was ai21âs willingness to create a customized pricing plan to sync with tweet hunterâs usage and growth. tweet hunter saved significantly on customization costs because ai21âs pricing for custom fine-tuned model usage is the same as the foundation model usage. other llms (such as open aiâs) offer customization at approximately six times the cost of their foundational models.â with these criteria coming together perfectly, tweet hunter set out to optimize the product to have an 8-figure exit.â the first challenge: generative ai for social mediaâ social media channels have strict specifications such as character limits, use of hashtags, and even tone of voice which makes effective generative ai in social media a challenging task, requiring intense experimentation and refinement.â initially, this was a challenge for tweet hunter since their primary product offering was designed for twitter.â ai21 offered a 3-click custom model training which tweet hunter effectively leveraged using their proprietary data to fine-tune a model for the exact capabilities they envisioned. ai21 were flexible with both their approach and features so tweet hunter could build a tool with multiple junctions for ai to assist. the second challenge: too many distinct use cases writing engaging tweets presents a multi-level challenge: start with a creative hook, keep it succinct, and build an engaging experience for threads.â this means your ai text generator must be adaptable to different use cases. also, each of these use cases need to integrate seamlessly while being mindful of the user experience.â âtwitterâs own user interface and algorithm is optimized for engagement and consumption, it's not optimized to inspire you. and thatâs a problemâ says thibault. ai21 anticipated diverse use cases and built their large language model to be flexible and adaptable from the onset. as a result, tweet hunter could fine tune the model in three clicks, iterate quickly and reach success.â the resulting model was built with three distinct capabilities and two sub-capabilitiesâ thread idea generator hook generator tweet writer sub-capabilities tweet extender (expands on the tweet youâre already started writing) each of these features are presented in a fluid transition on the tweet hunter platform, which lead to over 5000 paying customers for the tool. the third challenge: unreliable data to train large language modelsâ tweet hunterâs founders had tried every method under the sun to consolidate relevant data, from using freelancers to creating spreadsheets themselves.â not only was this exercise time intensive but it also produced inconsistent and unreliable results.â they were so disappointed after trying out multiple generative ai tools that they switched back to manual data collection. they were worried that poor quality examples would interfere with the very premise of tweet hunter: inspiration for great content.â enter ai21.â the studioâs in-built functionality allowed tweet hunter to fine tune the model to learn from a diverse tweet database. ai21's generated suggestions became exponentially better as the system evolved, and tweet hunter's goal of helping creators write save-worthy tweets was achieved in a fraction of the time expected. ai21âs custom model and proactive engagement throughout the journey was exactly what tweet hunter needed in a partner.â âwe deeply appreciate ai21âs level of involvement with our product and needs in the early days. we were able to evaluate the modelâs quality before production and maintain high standards on the quality of tweets.â says thibault.â what changed for tweet hunter after working with ai21? in the last two years, thibaultâs personal account grew from 2,000 followers to 60,000 followers. with tweet hunter's scheduling feature and tweet generation tools powered by ai21âs language models, he (and other users) could tweet frequently and effectively.â tweet hunter scaled to 1m arr and an 8-figure exit in under a year.â âthe content is very high quality. the tool works with diverse creators, varied niches, and complex topics. so most of the growth comes from the fact that our users are actually successful with the tool.â says thibault .â the level of personalization possible with ai21 propelled tweet hunter to first place for multiple creators.â https://twitter.com/mvxlondon/status/1621192750900051971 âpersonalized, highly viral tweet formats developed with ai21 helped busy users share valuable content. that was the win. our tool became 10 times faster with the ai integration.â says thibault.â the road forward with lempireâs acquisition of tweet hunter, the road forward is fast-paced and fascinating.â the team plans to introduce new features to the platform based on public feedback. ai21 is also set to be integrated with other products in lempireâs toolkit: personalized cold emails, automated follow-ups, and engagement with leads across multiple channels. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get?

ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/verb-ai-case-study,"how verb created a game-changing author tool with ai21 studio case study how verb created a game-changing author tool with ai21 studio discover how verb.ai used ai21 studio to create a revolutionary writing tool for authors, improving brainstorming and expression. read the case study now. according to a new york times article , 81 percent of americans feel they have a book in them that they should write. now, it may be an old statistic, but mankindâs desire to share stories has been around since the dawn of time as a way to share empathy, connection, and entertainment. so, it surely isnât leaving human nature anytime soon.â but at the risk of stating the obvious: writing a book is hard. in fact, the writer of the aforementioned article, an author of 14 books, says âwithout attempting to overdo the drama of the difficulty of writing â¦ composing a book is almost always to feel oneself in a state of confusion, doubt and mental imprisonment.ââ yeah, itâs a lot of hard work. so how did ai21 studio help verb, an ai-enhanced tool for fiction writers, create a cutting-edge application designed to help writers and hobbyists alike complete their novels without all the hassle and uncertainty? we spoke to ryan bowman, publishing and creative writing veteran and part of verbâs small team of founders, to find out how ai21 studio was a key to such creative writing success. forging the way toward a new creative ai tool verb is a writing tool that helps make completing long-form narratives â novels for now but later films, tv shows, even video games â faster, easier, and more fun. it does so by assisting with all key stages of creation: brainstorming, writing, and editing. but all that wasnât plausible until they found the perfect language learning model (llm). letâs dive in further. use case #1: brainstorming plot pointsâ as we saw in the new york times quote above, keeping an entire story straight inside your head can be a lot of work. as anyone whoâs tried to write long-form anything knows, it can get messy, convoluted, jumbled, and sometimes, uninspiring.â âthey say novel writing is a group activity done by yourself,â ryan tells us. âso one of verbâs jobs is to be that other person, that brainstorm partner.â thatâs why they set out to create one of their most important â and as it soon turned out, most popular â functions inside of their app: brainstorming. this feature allows you to plan the novel scene by scene, chapter by chapter. that type of brainstorming could look like the following:â you write: âben is sitting in his office and a woman appears next door.â you click: âsuggest a plot pointâ ai generates: âthe woman pulls out a gun and chases him through the hallway.â then, you can either: run with that idea in your scene and use it as the next plot point, or continue clicking the âwhat happens nextâ button to generate more ideas until you find one that sparks your imagination and helps you continue. an incredibly useful tool for writers, itâs been something that keeps these authors coming back for more. âone of the most amazing findings weâve seen,â adds ryan, âis that the more you use what makes verb special - ai features like plot planning, the more likely you are to come back and write.ââ use case #2: writing literary language generative ai models are incredibly diverse, and capable of outputting new content, summaries, translations, answers to questions, and more. but one thing they havenât been able to do just yet is write literary works. thatâs to say, these ai models can create â but theyâre not necessarily creative.â âwe needed to build tools that are specific to the problems of a novelist. it couldnât be just about generating text,â ryan explains, noting that verb knew the ai model they were to use must be able to generate discursive literary language.â âlanguage learning models (llm) are not natural storytellers,â says ryan, going on to explain how much storytelling is a learned craft; something that must be practiced for years in order to call it a skill. âthere is 2,000 years of literary and practical theory backing up the idea that telling stories is hard â important and necessary but difficult.â luckily, ryan and the team at verb found the literary solution they needed in ai21 studio. âwhen generating texts for our users who are looking for more discursive, more literary, more discriminating language, ai21 turned out to have a good tone and feel,â he says. use case #3: fine-tuning, iterations & customer supportâ one of the critical tasks of validating generative models is having criteria. to validate the reliability of this sort of generative ai effectively, you still need human involvement â especially when creating something brand new to the market.â howâd verb achieve this? verb built a platform that tests generative output amongst thousands of judgments across multiple writing professionals. these individuals look at different paragraphs of literary texts and decide which ones they like better, which ultimately helps verb build a gradient of quality.â âwe keep trying and testing and building iterations on top,â says ryan, noting that they are always adding options to see which ones humans prefer. âas crazy as it sounds, we are in the process of teaching it literary theory.ââ along the same lines, itâs important to note that creating something so new to the market doesnât just call for multiple iterations but also gathers support from everyone involved. âweâre in a world of newness,â ryan laments. âthere is nothing like [verb] so weâre not always sure what weâre supposed to be doing â it is freeing and slightly frightening at the same time.â ryan and the team at verb knew they needed a company that could see in their vision â which is when they turned to ai21 studio. âwe found working with ai21 to be a breath of fresh air,â says ryan, noting that it felt like a collaboration done with real human faces they can interact with for guidance, assistance, and ideas â rather than a business-client relationship. the results: more authors finishing their novels, faster the self-publishing landscape of 2022 shows that indie writers are becoming the new norm. but ai has been an alleged threat to writers since its inception, leading many people to believe that writers wouldnât even want the help of an ai-enhanced tool to get them across the finish line.â so, of course, verb also has to ask themselves the question: are writers really interested in having a machine collaborator help them with their creative writing? âour early data says that they are,â says ryan, noting that since launching its alpha version using ai21 studio, verb has seen a dramatic uptake of this experimental tool.â not to mention, as we saw with the brainstorming feature, the more creative and collaborative the model, the more likely writers are to stick around the app. in fact, ryan confirms that there are a dozen or so authors (out of an intimate group of alpha users) who have done the hardest task â actually finishing their book! â stating that verb helped them do just that.â with verb, and the help of ai21 studio, it can be done. dare we say â it can be done faster, easier, and with more fun. verb.ai & creative texts in the future verb launched its beta version in late december 2022 to a select number of users, and plans to use this custom model to expand into other narrative forms such as screenwriting and tv & film. with the pairing of new tools such as verb with custom models from ai21 studio, generative ai has evolved from just helping individuals generate text to something much more intertwined with the human love of storytelling; an ai tool that is not a threat to writers but actually a collaborator, a copy editor, a creative director, and even a confidante for inspired wordsmiths around the world. are you interested in building your own custom model with ai21 studio by your side?

t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio,"summarizing legal documents for different personas using ai21 studio tutorial summarizing legal documents for different personas using ai21 studio create your own custom summarizer using ai21 studio's large language models. this tutorial demonstrates the process on legal documents. weâve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who actually reads those terms and conditions to be honest?). imagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. in today's information overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. there's no surprise here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year ?). aside from inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, only 16% of employees read their employment contracts entirely before signing !).â this is where ai-driven summarization tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, users can (ideally) quickly extract relevant information from a text. with large language models, the development of those tools is easier than ever, and you can offer your users a summary that is specifically tailored to their preferences. let's take legal documents, for example. though they are written in english, many people find legal documents to be difficult to comprehend, as if they were actually written in a foreign language. moreover, the interesting parts of each document may differ depending on the person who reads it, so off-the-shelf summarization tools may be too general or too specific. as an example, let's look at the involved personas: lawyers . they are interested in several key points, but legal language and terms are especially relevant to them. your average joe. doesnât understand all the legal terms, and really wants to get the gist in simple words. using the irs as our example, we will demonstrate here how to build a simple summarizer for those 2 personas, and discuss which future directions one should consider. working with large language models large language models naturally follow patterns in input (prompt), and provide coherent completion that follows the same patterns. for that, we want to feed them with several examples in the input ("" few-shot prompt"" ), so they can follow through. the process of creating the correct prompt for your problem is called prompt engineering, and you can read more about it here . collecting data ideally, you should have a variety of examples to draw from. it is important that those examples represent the actual documents that your summarizer should work on. this means they should be written in the same way as real world documents, and they should be as varied as possible. don't have it? no need to worry - large language models generalize exceptionally well, so the results will still be good. in the end, optimal results can always be achieved with proper data - but you can revisit this at a later date. summarize for lawyers if you are summarizing legal documents for lawyers, you should definitely maintain all legal terms from the original document. in this demonstration, we will work on the opening paragraphs of legal letters. here is an example of a few-shot prompt: you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to your authorized representativesâ letter of may 19, 2022, and subsequent correspondence, requesting rulings regarding the income, estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (gst) tax consequences of the proposed division of trust 1. the facts and representations submitted are as follows: grandparent died on date 1, leaving the residue of grandparentâs probate estate in equal shares to trust 1 and trust 2, testamentary trusts established under will. trust 1 is held for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1âs descendants, and trust 2 is held for the benefit of grandchild 2 and grandchild 2âs descendants. grandchild 1 has five children, great-grandchild 1, great-grandchild 2, great-grandchild 3, greatgrandchild 4, and great-grandchild 5. grandchild 2 has one child, great-grandchild 6. neither grandchild 1 nor grandchild 2 has any deceased children. trustees serve as trustees of trust 1. trust 1 is the subject of this ruling request. section 9(a) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the net income of trust 1 to or for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1âs descendants in such proportions and at such times as trustees determine is desirable or necessary, considering their needs, best interests, and other sources of income, or may annually accumulate and add all or part of the net income to the principal of trust 1. section 9(b) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the principal of trust 1 to or for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1âs descendants in such proportions plr-110419-22 3 and at such times as trustees determine is desirable or necessary for their medical care, comfortable maintenance, education, or general support and welfare, considering their other resources. section 9(c) of trust 1 provides that trust 1 will terminate 21 years after the death of the survivor of grandchild 1 and grandchild 2, and the principal of trust 1 will be distributed to grandchild 1âs descendants, per stirpes. if, however, grandchild 1 and grandchild 1âs descendants all die before that date, trust 1 will terminate early, and the principal of trust 1 will be distributed to trust 2. summary: - grandparent died and left the residue of his estate to trust 1 and trust 2, testamentary trusts established under will. the trustees of trust 1 want to divide the estate equally between grandchild 1 and grandchild 2. - section 9(a) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the net income to grandchild 1 and grandchild 1's descendants in any proportion they determine is desirable. - section 9(b) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute principal to grandchild 1 and grandchild 1's descendants as they determine is desirable. - section 9(c) of trust 1 provides that if grandchild 1 and grandchild 1's descendants all die before 21 years, trust 1 will terminate early. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: dear [name], this letter ruling is in response to a request from your authorized representative dated march 11, 2022, and subsequent documentation requesting an extension of an additional five years under internal revenue code (âircâ) section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings. taxpayer represents the facts as follows. facts taxpayer was incorporated as a state nonprofit corporation. taxpayer is exempt from federal income tax under irc section 501(a) as an organization described in irc section 501(c)(3) and is classified as a private foundation under irc section 509(a). taxpayer was created by individuals to support the domestic and international community and various charitable organizations. individuals were substantial contributors to taxpayer within the meaning of irc section 507(d)(2), and therefore disqualified persons with respect to taxpayer under irc section 4946(a)(1)(a). as a result of individualsâ death, taxpayer received a shares of entity 1 common voting stock from trust, a disqualified person, on date 1, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. additionally, on date 2, granddaughter, who is the granddaughter of one of the individuals, and who serves as a co-trustee of taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from trust of b shares of entity 1 common voting stock. granddaughter is also a disqualified person under irc section 4946. the combined shares of taxpayer and granddaughter represent approximately c percent of entity 1âs outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in entity 1. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the a shares, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). on date 3, also as a result of individualsâ death, taxpayer received from trust an approximate z percent membership interest in entity 2, an llc, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the llc membership interest, which is a minority interest, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 2 under irc section 4943(c)(1). summary: - a taxpayer requested an extension of five years under irc section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings. - a testamentary gift of stock to taxpayer and a testamentary disposition to granddaughter, both disqualified persons, resulted in taxpayer having excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). -

the parties requested an extension of time under â§301.9100-3 of the procedure and administration regulations to file an election. - the parties are requesting an extension of time to file the election statement with respect to purchaser's acquisition of all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder on date 1. - the parties represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662. ## notes it is wise to try several phrasings for your prompt. you can, for instance, keep it simple and direct by writing: summarize the following part of a legal letter while maintaining formal terms. letter: [letter] summary: alternatively, you can take a more elaborate approach, such as: you are legalai, an ai legal assistant that excels at summarizing legal documents. below you will find part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: [letter] summary: as you can see, we are providing the model with several examples, separated by a stop sequence, which is easily spotted while reading the text. you can read more about stop sequences here . because this task requires high accuracy, we recommend working at a low temperature. it's best to explore the range of 0.0-0.3, since temperature 0 does tend to produce short summaries. you can read more about temperature here . you can test several options for the prompt in our playground. there is a consistent structure to all the examples in the prompt. this few-shot prompt can be created using the following code (assuming you have the paragraphs and summaries): def make_single_example(letter, summary):
    example = ""you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms.\n""
    example += ""letter:\n""

million lawyers in the united states alone, most peopleâ  (still) aren't lawyers and have trouble understanding legal documents. in this case, we probably want the summary to be written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. as this task involves both summarizing and simplifying texts, it is inherently more difficult. thus, we will probably need more ""shots"" in our few-shot prompt (in this case, we added another example to the prompt). here is an example of a few-shot prompt: you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary is short and written in simple words. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to your authorized representativesâ letter of may 19, 2022, and subsequent correspondence, requesting rulings regarding the income, estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (gst) tax consequences of the proposed division of trust 1. the facts and representations submitted are as follows: grandparent died on date 1, leaving the residue of grandparentâs probate estate in equal shares to trust 1 and trust 2, testamentary trusts established under will. trust 1 is held for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1âs descendants, and trust 2 is held for the benefit of grandchild 2 and grandchild 2âs descendants. grandchild 1 has five children, great-grandchild 1, great-grandchild 2, great-grandchild 3, greatgrandchild 4, and great-grandchild 5. grandchild 2 has one child, great-grandchild 6. neither grandchild 1 nor grandchild 2 has any deceased children. trustees serve as trustees of trust 1. trust 1 is the subject of this ruling request. section 9(a) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the net income of trust 1 to or for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1âs descendants in such proportions and at such times as trustees determine is desirable or necessary, considering their needs, best interests, and other sources of income, or may annually accumulate and add all or part of the net income to the principal of trust 1. section 9(b) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the principal of trust 1 to or for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1âs descendants in such proportions plr-110419-22 3 and at such times as trustees determine is desirable or necessary for their medical care, comfortable maintenance, education, or general support and welfare, considering their other resources. section 9(c) of trust 1 provides that trust 1 will terminate 21 years after the death of the survivor of grandchild 1 and grandchild 2, and the principal of trust 1 will be distributed to grandchild 1âs descendants, per stirpes. if, however, grandchild 1 and grandchild 1âs descendants all die before that date, trust 1 will terminate early, and the principal of trust 1 will be distributed to trust 2. summary: the purpose of this letter is to describe a trust set up by a grandparent for the benefit of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. the trustees may distribute money from the trust, but they must follow certain rules. after 21 years, the trust will end, and the remaining money will be distributed to the main beneficiary's descendants. if all the descendants of the main beneficiary pass away before then, the remaining money will be transferred to another trust. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary is short and written in simple words. letter: dear [name], this letter ruling is in response to a request from your authorized representative dated march 11, 2022, and subsequent documentation requesting an extension of an additional five years under internal revenue code (âircâ) section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings. taxpayer represents the facts as follows. facts taxpayer was incorporated as a state nonprofit corporation. taxpayer is exempt from federal income tax under irc section 501(a) as an organization described in irc section 501(c)(3) and is classified as a private foundation under irc section 509(a). taxpayer was created by individuals to support the domestic and international community and various charitable organizations. individuals were substantial contributors to taxpayer within the meaning of irc section 507(d)(2), and therefore disqualified persons with respect to taxpayer under irc section 4946(a)(1)(a). as a result of individualsâ death, taxpayer received a shares of entity 1 common voting stock from trust, a disqualified person, on date 1, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. additionally, on date 2, granddaughter, who is the granddaughter of one of the individuals, and who serves as a co-trustee of taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from trust of b shares of entity 1 common voting stock. granddaughter is also a disqualified person under irc section 4946. the combined shares of taxpayer and granddaughter represent approximately c percent of entity 1âs outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in entity 1. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the a shares, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). on date 3, also as a result of individualsâ death, taxpayer received from trust an approximate z percent membership interest in entity 2, an llc, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the llc membership interest, which is a minority interest, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 2 under irc section 4943(c)(1). summary: a nonprofit organization asks for more time to sell extra stocks it received after the deaths of a few key contributors. nonprofit organizations have a limit on how many stocks they can keep, so they request an extension to get rid of them. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary is short and written in simple words. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to a letter dated march 15, 2022, submitted on behalf of s corporation target, purchaser, and shareholder (collectively, the ""parties""), requesting an extension of time under â§301.9100-3 of the procedure and administration regulations to file an election. the parties are requesting an extension of time to file the election statement under â§1.336-2(h)(3)(iii) of the income tax regulations (the ""election statement"") with respect to purchaser's acquisition of all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder on date 1. the material information submitted is summarized below. on date 1, purchaser acquired all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder (the ""stock disposition""). it has been represented that the stock disposition qualified as a ""qualified stock disposition"" as defined in â§1.336-1(b)(6). the parties intended to make a section 336(e) election for the stock disposition but, for various reasons, a timely election was not fully made. subsequently, this request was submitted, under â§301.9100-3, for an extension of time to file the election statement. the parties each represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662. regulations promulgated under section 336(e) permit certain sales, exchanges, or distributions of stock of a corporation to be treated as asset dispositions if: (1) the disposition is a ""qualified stock disposition"" as defined in â§1.336-1(b)(6); and (2) a section 336(e) election is made. summary: due to the difficulty of this task, this prompt is not sufficient. by adding another example (""shot""), however, we will get much better results. below you can see the completion: a corporation asks the government for more time to file a statement related to its financial performance for a specific tax year. the government has granted the request but may check the information provided by the company later.<br> ## notes: like in the previous case, you should try several phrasings for your prompt. you can test several options for the prompt in our playground . alternatively, you could have summarized for lawyers first, and then

on the shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly.

https://www.ai21.com/blog/latitude-case-study,"how latitude scaled production of their gaming worlds while reducing costs case study how latitude scaled production of their gaming worlds while reducing costs ai21 labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost. latitude is a pioneer in the ai gaming space, offering powerful ai-generated digital gamescapes for its players. latitude is most famously known for ai dungeon, a text-based adventure game that uses artificial intelligence to generate unique and unpredictable stories, depending on the choices that a player makes. in the past, computer adventure games were limited in terms of the amount of actions and scenarios they offered. by using large language models, ai dungeon grants players the flexibility to perform virtually any action and have the game respond to that action.â example from ai dungeon latitude got good traction with its early implementation of ai dungeon on top of gpt-3, but when planning their future roadmap, they quickly realized that they needed an llm partner who shared their vision of immersive ai-driven experiences. they found an eager partner in ai21 labs, who worked collaboratively with latitude to discover roadblocks and brainstorm solutions. this resulted in improvements to issues such as latency, flexibility, and user satisfaction, to name just a few. so, how did they do it? ai21 labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost efficiency. latitude found ai21 labs to be a collaborative llm partner, which wasnât just a plug-and-play solution to a scaling problem, but rather a trusted partner with whom they could collaborate on ai solutions.â but what were the exact problems preventing latitude from realizing its vision? and how did ai21 labs overcome them? read on for the full story. who is latitude? latitude was never envisioned as a gaming company - it actually started as a hackathon project that translated into a dungeons and dragons plugin. the team decided to go to market with the plugin, and within the first week, they had roughly 100,000 customers which quickly grew to a million in just the first month.â the verdict was in: there was a creative use case for large language models for game-like experiences and writing.â â searching for a collaborative solutionâ latitude wanted to offer a stronger game experience, with richer text and better ai responses. for this, they partnered with the legacy gpt-3 enterprise, openai.â but with rapidly evolving technology came growing pains, and openai was not aligned with latitude's vision - thus, the visionary gaming experience became impossible. it became clear to latitude that they needed to seek out a new tech partner who was interested in solving the use case of creating an ai-driven adventure role play game.. switching from openai to ai21 labs latitude booked a call with ai21 labs when theyâd just launched their jurassic-1 model. a jurassic prototype was set up for latitude, and they started experimenting with the features and the accuracy of results. the final model was perfect for latitudeâs ai dungeon use case. soon after that, the team declared it an alpha model for their audience. in order to get to that stage, the teams had to overcome two massive roadblocks. the first roadblock: creative restrictionsâ â openaiâs policy of non-violence restricted integral elements of latitudeâs ai dungeon adventures â quests, swords, and fights. it was impossible to have a role playing expedition without weapons.â âwe were interested in a partner who understands the nuances of the creative use case.â says ryan seamons, vp of product at latitude.â ryan seamons - vp product @ latitude latitude prioritized finding a partner who was not only aligned philosophically but willing to become a true partner and collaborator in building a quality ai-driven role-play experience. âwe need to offer ai-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players. we need models that are fast, reliable, and creative.â says seamons.â the collaborative opportunity: agilityâ ai21 labsâ team of developers, creators, and stakeholders were analytical problem-solvers who created reliable production models for latitude. a precise production model is critical for a gaming company like latitude. it defines the customer experience and determines whether users will come back. so, it needs to be hyper-accurate and reliable. to achieve this, there has to be excellent communication during prototyping. latitude and ai21 labs had a system for rapid back-and-forth between teams and numerous collaborative checkpoints. as a result, they got to the production stage quickly. even after launching the model, the ai21 labs team worked tirelessly to ship updates, create new features, and build on feedback.â âweâve experimented with other tools, but they have been demanding and daunting with direct orders and no problem-solving. but not ai21 (labs). theyâre enthusiastic, collaborative, and innovative â a true gaming visionary.â says seamons. the second problem: exponential costs latitude offers ai-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players.â not only did latitude want to offer existing models to new players, they also wanted to create more immersive and realistic worlds. they wanted an llm partner who offered customizable pricing because gaming models are extremely expensive to run at scale.â â âai costs are one of our most significant ongoing expenses, and so finding ways to reduce our ai costs help us to operate sustainably as a business.â the collaborative opportunity: cost-effectiveness through optimizationâ ai21 labs put in hours of skilled talent to make the large language model efficient enough to be cost-effective. they helped latitude transition from jurassic-1 jumbo to jurassic-1 grande to scale performance at the right cost. jurassic-1 jumbo, ai21âs biggest model, processes 178 billion parameters to generate an output. but after running multiple experiments, their team concluded that latitudeâs game did not need this many parameters. they switched from jumbo to grande (which uses 17b parameters), and the result was the perfect sweet spot for a compelling experience at a sustainable price with faster response time. the cost savings are great, but the faster response times are also something players can benefit from. the lower costs also let latitude experiment with additional ways to improve output quality, such as hydra mode which generates multiple responses and selects the best one for a player. being able to experiment with new data sets more quickly and affordably also yielded positive results and will be a major part of latitudeâs ai strategy this year. â the biggest benefit of working with ai21 (labs) is for agile companies who want more hands-on attention in service. what iâve been most impressed with is the proactiveness in optimizing costs for multiple use cases. itâs been a breath of fresh air compared to competitors.â says seamons. the final results latitude discovered that the grande model struck the right balance of cost vs. performance, all while generating higher quality results than small models such as gpt-j or gpt-3 curie.â by using an ensemble model approach called hydra, latitude was able to achieve quality similar to that of larger models. at every stage, the team at ai21 labs devised innovative solutions to roadblocks and proactively and continuously improved cost

paper: standing on the shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly.

https://www.ai21.com/blog/harambee-case-study,"how harambee built conversational flows to achieve a 20% sign-up increase case study how harambee built conversational flows to achieve a 20% sign-up increase learn how harambee used ai21 labs' custom models to create an nlp chatbot app to onboard job seekers to one of their career programs. harambee is the official platform for government bodies wanting to hire youth in south africa. but when the pandemic hit, they needed to find a low-touch yet incredibly authentic way to connect with the growing number of unemployed youth who were looking to get trained and hired. harambee logo so, how was it done? harambee not only created a new virtual onboarding process, but also drove a 20% conversion rate increase in sign-ups by using ai21 as their natural language processing (nlp) engine. this was achieved by setting up our language models to act as intelligent chatbots. the bots were able to understand the context of each conversation, build rapport with the individuals, and respond naturally â guiding them toward their career goals. we spoke with brent davidoff, who leads harambee's effort to scale transformative interventions using their omni channel contact center. brent davidoff, harambee youth employment accelerator who is harambee? harambee youth employment accelerator is a not-for-profit social enterprise that solves youth employment through partnerships. harambee works with partners who are also committed to results that can work at scale â including government, the private sector, civil society, and over three million youth. by fusing brilliant minds with best-in-class technology,â harambee is working to unlock jobs and break down the barriers that keep millions of young south africans unemployed. but how they bridge the gap between unemployed with no experience to ready to work and employable is a key reason why harambee eventually needed ai21 studio. harambee put these youth through a simulation of a workplace that they call the âbridging processâ. in it, the individuals report to a manager and are measured on punctuality and soft skills with a scorecard.â âafter three months of daily bridging, they were transformed,â said brent, noting that employers would always see a positive difference in these young adults after completing the program. and then the 2020 pandemic happened.â pivoting their processes, and turning to nlp during a pandemic the once highly personalized, streamlined work socialization experience was now at risk. âwith only 120 personnel at the time, we stopped doing face-to-face processes and didnât do the bridging anymore,â says brent. like many companies during that time, they went fully remote and launched a new website â sayouth . and while they still had companies wanting to employ these youths, these individuals werenât yet ready for the job market. âthey were missing the secret sauce [of the bridging process],â adds brent. searching for a solution that could match human intelligence this led them to the development of a chatbot that they called âcoachmeeâ. it created a conversation based learning experience that used evidence-based techniques to effect measurable behavior change in its users. but not without some snags along the way. âfrom our previous work with other chatbots [before finding ai21], we had seen how the signup process was a vital component for ensuring high levels of engagement and most chatbots failed to do that with an audience like ours for a number of reasons,â brent tells us, explaining why he went searching for a new solution. hereâs what harambee needed â and what led them to ai21. problem #1: a chatbot that can understand, not just repeat their focus was deeper than simply having quick response times for their customers. harambee needed help creating trust, rapport, and relationships with their users during their sign-up process â a critical, pivotal moment in their program. âtraditional intent-based nlps are all about understanding what someone says, but then returning something that is prewritten. but no conversation is like that. you must be unique,â says brent, providing us with an example of an everyday conversation during the sign-up process. chatbot: âwelcome to coachmee, please tell me your name.â person: â19547896â chatbot: âthat looks like an id number, would you mind, with respect, telling me your name again?â person: âmy name isâ rejoice precious mikateko â chatbot: âhello, rejoice!â âalready there, the ability to see someone and get their name right. âthereâs no traditional intent-based nlp that can do that.â problem #2: adapt to overcome language barriers and context there are many models that offer a multitude of language options, but one was missing â what about broken english?â there are times when people switch between languages and use a mix of words that would not be understood by a normal chatbot. our goal isn't just to find something that speaks one of south africa's 11 official languages, but to find out what someone really is trying to convey.â says brent. why ai21 studio? better accessibility and support while we at ai21 have best practices to help mitigate the risk of malicious use of language models, ai21âs barrier to entry was non-existent, meaning harambee could jump right in.â âi was astonished that there was no huge waiting list to get into this platform and i found the company's vision quite inspiring. i signed up and started playing around on the playground.ââ itâs important to be able to interact with the models, explore presets, and play around before committing to an nlp. âi am not a coder,â he adds. âwhen i saw that ai21 studio had an easy-to-use fine-tuning feature that did not require any previous coding experience, i was excited to see how quickly i could prototype different conversational flows and build something that felt human and relatable.â beyond the chatbot: how harambee used ai21 to reach their end goal harambee saw incredible success using the chatbot. âthe conversations [work seekers are having] are incredible,â says brent. âfor the first time, they feel like they are important. for the first time, they feel like their goals are important. they feel like there is someone there to support them.â beyond building rapport and genuine connection with the south african youth, they were able to utilize ai21 to make their jobs easier and improve further processes. solution #1: content creation through âlifehacksâ with ai copywriting, you can automate repetitive writing tasks. brent and the harambee team were able to develop around 60 different ""lifehacks"" for users who had signed up for coachmee check-in sessions. lifehacks have to strike a careful balance between being aspirational andâ transcendent, while being practical and relevant. all within a few sentences, making sure someone doesn't have to scroll back up to read the full message.â another unique contribution of ai21 labs was around the use of emojis, which enabled the lifehacks to be much more playful and engaging. solution #2: unique reference letters with the summarization tool, you can compress documents and extract key insights into short summaries . brent and the harambee team used this to create 100% unique, relevant reference letters for each individual who finished their training.â âsometimes the model can go way too far and make up crazy things about the person,â says brent, discussing what has gone wrong while using other applications.â â[but] when a user completes 20 check-ins with coachmee, we have enough data that can factually testify to someone's commitment to growth and goal-achievement. that information, together with the deep insights into their aspirations and personality that we lifted from the initial sign-up conversation, we are able to use studio api to generate beautiful reference letters that they can attach to their cvs and take with them to interviews,â explains brent. âi [once] got a message saying, âi gotta frame this!ââ reference letter - example the result: helping thousand of youths gain employment when they need it mostâ harambee has fine-tuned its ai21 nlp experience to drive meaningful conversations. their data shows that the stronger the rapport that is built at the beginning of the relationship, the more chance the person has at continuing and completing the process. pillar 1 - engagement: most start, most finish brent concludes that âcompared to the first iteration of coachmee which did not use an nlp for the sign-up process, our conversion rate from sign-up to completion has improved by 20%.â in addition, he tells us that almost 1,000 young people have measurably higher prospects of employment thanks to the unique reference letters that ai21 studio api helped create. âai21 has been the most generous, collaborative and supportive technology partner that i have ever worked with.â we are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our nlp technology to help elevate the careers of thousands of youths in africa. we hope this project serves as inspiration to many other organizations around the world. about the author enjoyed this?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/build-a-dashboard-based-on-freeform-sentiment-analysis-of-hotel-reviews,"build a dashboard based on freeform sentiment analysis of hotel reviews tutorial build a dashboard based on freeform sentiment analysis of hotel reviews analyze large quantities of reviews in minutes using ai21 studio imagine that you have a platform for hotel reservations, similar to hotels.com . on your platform, hotel visitors can leave written reviews and an overall star rating for the hotel. these reviews allow hotel owners to gain a general understanding of guest satisfaction through their overall score, but thatâs just one part of the story. the quality of the hotel experience is a combination of many factors, including the room quality, the facilities, and the staff. ideally, the owner would like to get a clear picture of their hotelâs strengths and weaknesses so they can improve on the aspects that are lacking and highlight the aspects that visitors find positive. to extract these insights, some hotel owners sit down from time to time and read all of the reviews that were written about their hotel. this is a tedious task - one you, as a developer, would probably want to spare your users from. what if you could create a dashboard that highlights the areas guests mention positively or negatively in their reviews? as a result, your user - in this case, the hotel owner - can get a real-time snapshot of their strengths and weaknesses with just a glance at this dashboard. not so long ago, you would have needed to work pretty hard to create a solution like that (for example, using several classical methods ). but with large language models (llms), itâs really easy. you can perform this analysis with high accuracy, even with no prior knowledge of natural language processing (nlp). if that sounds appealing to you, then read on. by the end of this post, you will be able to implement this feature in your platform or product. this post will walk you through the process of building an nlp-powered dashboard for a hotel, including: using an external api to gather real-world data. performing freeform combined topic extraction and sentiment analysis using jurassic-1, part of the ai21 studio suite of large language models. generating the output in a convenient format (json) so itâs easier to process. if you are new to large language models, we recommend first reading this post . step 1: collect reviews using an external api you can find the hotels.com api on rapidapi . there are several endpoints to this api. we need the reviews endpoint, that returns the reviews for a given hotel, page-by-page. there are approximately 50 reviews per page. in order to retrieve all of the available reviews we will call the api while iterating through the pages. the following functions do just that: def get_hotel_reviews_page(hotel_id, page_number):

    return all_reviews â note that running this function requires an api key for the reviews endpoint, which you can obtain from rapidapi. this is not your ai21 studio api key. there are some edge cases that this function doesnât cover, such as requesting a page number that doesnât exist, but weâll set them aside for the purposes of this blog post. throughout this process, we will use the empire hotel in new york as a running example. you can use an api endpoint to get the hotel id, or you can find it in the hotelâs url on hotels.com: step 2: prepare the reviews data for the language model large language models are very powerful and can ingest text of all shapes and sizes, but as the old saying goes, âgarbage in, garbage outâ. if you feed the model a bad prompt, the results will be far from optimal. in this case, you should keep the following points in mind: reviews that are too short could be problematic since they often do not contain enough information to extract any meaningful insights. currently, our models are limited to the english language only. in order to remove reviews that are too short or not in english, you can apply some simple filters to all of the reviews: from langdetect import detect
def filter_reviews(reviews):
    en_reviews = [review for review in reviews if len(review)>=20 and detect(review)==""en""]
            
    return en_reviews â note: here, we have removed reviews that have no real content by applying a very basic filter. although this is not mandatory, we recommend that you pre-process your reviews by, for example, removing weird characters and extra spaces, etc. step 3: extract the categories and sentiments using ai21 studio this step is where you trulyâ  harness the power of ai21 studioâs large language models!â you want the model to extract the topics and sentiments of each free text review into a structured json format. you can do this by leveraging a main strength of language models: when provided with text in plain english, the language model can identify patterns and generate text that follows the same pattern. by feeding the model a prompt with a few examples (this is called a few-shot prompt ), it can identify the pattern and generate a reasonably good completion. obtaining these examples, however, requires you to manually go through several reviews, which we have done below. the resulting few-shot prompt is as follows (the reviews are as written by the platformâs users, with no grammar or spelling corrections): review: great experience for two teenagers. we would book again. location good. extracted sentiment: {""location"": ""positive""} ## review: extremely old cabinets, phone was half broken and full of dust. bathroom door was broken, bathroom floor was dirty and yellow. bathroom tiles were falling off. asked to change my room and the next room was in the same conditions. the most out of date and least maintained hotel i ever been on. extracted sentiment: {""cleaning"": ""negative"", ""hotel facilities"": ""negative"", ""room quality"": ""negative""} ## review: roof topâs view is gorgeous and the lounge area is comfortable. the staff is very courteous and the location is great. the hotel is outdated and the shower need to be clean better. the air condition runs all the time and cannot be control by the temperature control setting. extracted sentiment: {""cleaning"": ""negative"", ""ac"": ""negative"", ""room quality"": ""negative"", ""service"": ""positive"", ""view"": ""positive"", ""hotel facilities"": ""positive""} ## creating a good prompt is more than simply deciding on the pattern. the goal is to construct a prompt that triggers the model to generate the optimal completion (this is called prompt engineering ). to achieve this, you should keep the following in mind: variety: the examples in the prompt will determine the modelâs responses for unseen data, so they must be diverse enough to reflect the real-world distribution. this applies to both the structure of the reviews (such as length) and the content (the topics discussed in every review, the sentiments, etc.). be sure to include reviews that are mixed in sentiment (like the third example provided above), as these are usually harder to analyze. amount: how âfewâ examples should our few-shot prompt include? when it comes to this relatively complex task, it is recommended that you provide at least eight different examples in the prompt (depending on the number of topics and the variety within them). the most effective way to determine this is through testing it out in the playground. try it yourself! â additionally, in this use-case, we recommend setting the temperature to 0, as high accuracy is required more than creativity. increasing the temperature will result in more creative results, while lowering the temperature will increase their accuracy. curious about temperature? see step 4 in this post for more detail on this. happy with the prompt and want to start analyzing reviews? you can copy the few-shot prompt from the playground: and use the following function to create the prompt for every review: def create_review_prompt(review):
    few_shot_examples = few_shot_examples
    prompt = few_shot_examples + review + ""\nextracted sentiment:\n""
    return prompt â for every review, create the prompt and then call jurassic-1 to perform the analysis (you can take the call from the playground, as illustrated above, or use the function from here ). step 4: create the dashboard once you have the list of topics and sentiments, you can create your dashboard. first, gather all of the topics together, assigning a count of ""positive"" or ""negative"" to each topic. since you already have the completion in json format, you can process it using standard packages. however, as the format may not be perfect, and you donât want any failures in your automated process, you can add a simple try-catch block. this means if a completion from the model isnât in perfect json format, you drop it. you can use the following function: def get_topk_categories_and_score(sentiments, k=7):
    parsed_sentiments = []
    for sentiment in sentiments:
      try:
         parsed_sentiments.append(ast.literal_eval(sentiment))
      except syntaxerror:
        pass
    
    df = pd.dataframe(parsed_sentiments)

    # extract the k categories with the most reviews    
    keys = df.count().sort_values(ascending=false)[:k].index.tolist()
    
    category_names = ['negative', 'positive']
    scores = {}

    for key in keys:
        scores[key] = [(df[key] == category_names[0]).sum(), (df[key] == category_names[1]).sum()]
        
    return scores, category_names â at this stage, all thatâs left to do is create the figure. with minor changes to this matplotlib example, youâll have your dashboard: you can see that the hotel is deemed excellent in location and rather good in service and cleaning. however, it should invest more in the wifi and ac, and perhaps do some renovations or upgrades to the rooms and facilities. as a last step and some sanity check, youâll probably want to validate your results, but without manually reading every review. one way to do that is to compare them with those of other hotel platforms, such as booking.com. if you go to the booking.com page for this hotel , where visitors are asked to rate hotels across numerous categories, you will find the overall picture is very similar to your own analysis: summary by following the steps laid out in this post, you have built a very useful feature that can be implemented on hotel and accommodation platforms. thanks to large language models, analyzing pieces of text, such as reviews, has never been easier. a few simple tweaks, such as writing the examples in json format, can save a lot of time in post-processing, making the entire process faster and easier. you can find the full notebook in our dev-hub . are you interested in building your own feature?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/building-cv-profile-generator-using-ai21-studio,"build a cv profile generator using ai21 studio tutorial build a cv profile generator using ai21 studio in just a few minutes, you can transform an idea into a working and integrated application using ai21 studio can a machine automatically generate a paragraph of fluent text? not so long ago, the answer to this question was âno!â. today, thanks to large language models, practitioners with different levels of expertise can build applications that generate useful text for marketing, content writing and more.â hold on tight, because in this blog post weâre going to go from an idea to a completely new text generation feature that you can ship immediately. ready to get started?â motivation suppose you're building a job marketplace app or a personnel recruitment platform. you probably have a feature that lets candidates upload their cv to your system. those cvs aren't always stellar. for example, many of them lack a profile section - a short paragraph that highlights the candidateâs background, skills and ambitions. luckily, you can use ai21 studio to help your users by auto-generating a cv profile for them. this is just one example of short-form content generation, where language models are used to draft text up to a paragraph long (more examples are in the summary). in this post we'll build a cv profile generator that you can integrate into your application or website in just a few minutes of work. step 1: define the problem understanding what kind of text you want to generate is essential. in this case we need to ask ourselves:â  what makes a good cv profile that our users will appreciate? letâs take a look at some examples and try to find ones we like. here is an article you can find online that shows various types of cv profiles. for example, letâs look at a profile for a chemical engineer: i am a dedicated, hardworking and proactive chemical engineer with a strong background in design, plant operations, offshore operations, and process and safety improvements. i have solid work experience in designing, testing and analysing processes to increase the overall efficiency of operations. i am currently looking for an opportunity to utilise my technical skills in a challenging working environment and become a valuable asset to the organization that i work for. as you can see, itâs a short paragraph that covers the candidates background, experience and the type of role they are looking for. browsing through more examples, it is clear that most cv profiles follow this pattern. letâs make a note of a few examples (3-5 will do) that we like. our goal is to generate texts similar to these examples. now we are ready to log into the ai21 studio and start building. step 2: create your (initial) prompt language models take in some text as input and generate some likely continuation of that text. we call the input text the prompt and the generated text the completion . you can think of large language models as smart auto-completion algorithms: they are very good at latching on to hints and patterns expressed in plain english, and generating text that follows the same patterns.â for example, if we input a prompt that is likely to be followed by a cv profile, we can get the model to generate new and original cv profiles as completions. one simple way to do this is to spell out an instruction, just like you would when asking a person to produce some text: write a winning teaching cv profile: letâs take this prompt and see what the model will generate. go to the ai21 studio, put this prompt in the input field and click âgeneratedâ. this is the completion the model generated: mr george mwangi is a teacher who has completed diploma, degree and masters degree in education. he has vast teaching experience of 7 years. his expertise is in the field of science, biology, chemistry and physics. he is a hardworking, dedicated candidate with vast experience of teaching various levels, including university students. what do we like about this completion? it matches the profession we provided (teacher).â it contains relevant education and experience. it uses some good adjectives. what do we not like about this completion? this paragraph is written in third person (âmr mwangi isâ¦â), whereas our good cv profile examples are always written in the first person (âi amâ¦â). the details the model generated are completely made up - they may or may not reflect our candidates' true skills. how can we make the model produce the output we want? you can try to phrase the instruction differently. be descriptive and clear, and try a few different ones, like: following is an exceptional cv profile for a teacher: or here is an enthusiastic teacherâs cv profile: that said, you shouldn't spend too much time on choosing the perfect adjectives.â the most powerful tool you have at your disposal is providing examples that demonstrate what you expect from the model. this is the most effective way to guide the generations according to your intentions, and if you have time to do only one thing - this is it. in this case, we already collected some relevant examples in step 1. all thatâs left is to create the prompt from instruction-profile pairs. below you can find a prompt we made by stringing together a sequence of examples we liked. the bold text is the completion our model generated. write a winning sales/retail cv profile: i am a mature, positive and hardworking individual, who always strives to achieve the highest standard possible, at any given task. in my previous role as a sales representative, i demonstrated the ability to work under intense pressure, sell products and services to customers from all backgrounds, handle customer complaints and solve problematic situations as and when they arose. i was promoted twice for exceeding my sales targets. ## write a winning teaching cv profile: i am a loyal, talented and caring teacher who loves making a difference in the lives of young children. i am open-minded, patient and supportive towards other people, especially towards children or those who suffer from disabilities. in my previous role as a primary school teacher, i have taught and nurtured more than 100 pupils from all backgrounds, successfully preparing them for the next stages of their young lives. ## write a winning media cv profile: i am a professional, ambitious and highly skilled camera operator able to use a wide range of technical equipment, including professional cinematography camcorders. i have extensive experience working on a number of television and theatre projects, demonstrating an ability to follow artistic direction and the physical capability required on a professional production set. i am comfortable filming on-location and outside the studio with some previous work experience in live broadcasting. ## write a winning software engineer cv profile: i am a highly talented software engineer with extensive experience of developing complex software systems. i have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, which allow me to quickly identify and resolve problems. i am self-motivated, able to work on my own initiative and as part of a team. i have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, and i am able to communicate effectively with people from a wide range of backgrounds. ## did we solve all the problems? well, the profile is written in first person, just like we wanted. unfortunately, it still contains made up details. we solve this in the following section. there are a couple of important things to note here: the instruction we chose was âwrite a winning â¦ cv profile:â. itâs good to be consistent and use the exact same phrasing throughout the examples in the prompt. each cv profile ends with a pair of hashes, which establishes a pattern for the model to follow. as a result, when the model produces a new cv profile in the completion, it generates â##â after it. we can use this signal to detect that the entire profile has been written and terminate the generation using the stop sequence parameter . want to see the generation or check another profile? try it yourself in our playground . step 3: add personalization to your prompt the prompt we have at this point produces well-formatted, impressive-sounding cv profiles for specific roles. you can try it in the playground and see that itâs pretty reliable. each time we generate a new text, we get a random profile for a candidate for the desired role.â although the profiles fit the role, they may be inconsistent with the candidates' actual skills, experience and ambitions. you probably want to provide your users a way to guide the generated profile to stick to the facts that are true for them. one way to do it is to inject specific features that you want to be reflected in the profile into the instruction. we took the prompt from the previous section and tweaked it to include âfeaturesâ. we extracted them manually from the examples we gathered earlier. this is the completion generated by the model: write a winning business management cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. logical mind 2. problem solver 3. 2 years of experience in management 4. eager to learn profile: i have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things through to completion. i have more than 2 years of experience in managing and leading teams across multiple sectors. i am eager to learn, i enjoy overcoming challenges, and i have a genuine interest in business management and making organisations successful. ## write a winning it cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. experience it professional 2. record designing websites, networking and managing databases 3. excellent interpersonal skills 4. looking for a challenge profile: i am a highly competent it professional with a proven track record in designing websites, networking and managing databases. i have strong technical skills as well as excellent interpersonal skills, enabling me to interact with a wide range of clients. i am eager to be challenged in order to grow and further improve my it skills. my greatest passion is in life is using my technical know-how to benefit other people and organisations. ## write a winning sales executive cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. energetic and ambitious 2. 6 years of selling experience 3. love working in a team 4. independent 5. mba from stanford profile: i am an energetic and ambitious sales executive with 6 years of selling experience. i am a team player, but i am also able to work on my own initiative. i am an mba from stanford, and i am looking for a challenging position where i can use my sales skills to benefit an organisation. ## you can see that now we can direct the model to include specific skills and experience! want to see how your features turn into a profile? try here . when working with prompts like these, it is critical to maintain a strong correlation between the features and the generation. if an example's output mentions facts that totally contradict the input or are completely original and unrelated, the model will follow suit and have a tendency to make up things. we call this phenomenon âhallucinationsâ. on the other hand, if you omit certain features from an example's output, the model will imitate this and occasionally drop some of the provided features. to understand that, letâs take a look at the following bad example (do not try this at home!): write a winning business manager cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. creative person 2. experience in management 3. have an mba from stanford profile: i have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things through to completion. i have more than 2 years of experience in managing and leading teams across multiple sectors. i am eager to learn, i enjoy overcoming challenges, and i have a genuine interest in business management and making organisations successful. ## write a winning it manager cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. experience it professional 2. record designing websites, networking and managing databases 3. excellent interpersonal skills 4. looking for a challenge profile: having 3 years experience in all aspects of it, including web design, networking, databases and technical support. i am looking for a new challenge. i thrive in challenging environments and i am committed to high standards in all aspects of my work. ## a single example (business manager) was fed into the model here, but there is some mismatch between some skills and the profile. the table below shows both phenomena in this example: what was wrong with the prompt, and how it affected the completion. prompt (business manager) completion (it manager) hallucination 2 years of experience 3 years of experience omission creativity, mba interpersonal skills â step 4: explore the parameters another way to affect the completion is to adjust some of the generation parameters. there are quite a few parameters and you can learn about them here . for now, let's focus on one of the most significant parameters: temperature.â the temperature controls creativity. increasing the temperature tends to result in more varied and creative completions, whereas decreasing it produces more stable and repetitive completions. with temperature set to zero, the model will always generate the most probable completion for a given prompt (which will be the same completion every time). below are examples of three different generations using the same prompt from the previous step:â temperature completion 0 i am an energetic and ambitious sales executive with 6 years of selling experience. i am a team player, but i am also able to work on my own initiative. i am an mba from stanford, and i am looking for a challenging position where i can use my sales skills to benefit an organisation. 0.7 i am ambitious, energetic and hard-working. over the last 6 years, i have gained valuable experience in selling products and services to businesses and consumers. i possess strong communication and presentation skills and i am a team player. i am good at building relationships with clients and i am known for my integrity and honesty. i am currently studying for an mba from stanford. i am confident that i can build a successful career in sales. 1 i am an extremely ambitious and energetic individual with 6 years of selling experience. i have a strong business administration degree, along with an mba from stanford, which has increased my market knowledge. i am a team player who thrives in challenging environments and relishes the opportunity to work autonomously. want to see more results? try it yourself in the playground! step 5: integrate with your code after you've finished building your prompt and you are happy with the results you see in the playground, you'd want to integrate some code to call the ai21 studio api in your product. you can click the api button and copy the necessary code snippet. the request includes your api key (which is linked to your account), certain parameters, and more importantly - the prompt. in production the prompt will need to end with a different input every time we generate a completion, corresponding to the role and the candidate features. we'll need to write a bit of code that injects this into our prompt. here's how you would do it in python: def create_prompt(role, highlights):
    """"""
        arguments:
        - role         : what is the profession of the candidate
        - highlights   : what are the skills and ambitions of the candidate

        returns:
        - prompt       : a full prompt, including few shot examples
    """"""
    
    few_shot_prompt = #paste here the few shot prompt, ends with the stop sequence#
    current_input = f""write a winning {role} incorporating the following features:\n""
    skills_str = """"

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models,"best practices for deploying language models tutorial best practices for deploying language models cohere, openai, and ai21 labs have developed a preliminary set of best practices applicable to any organization developing or deploying large language models computers that can read and write are here, and they have the potential to fundamentally impact daily life. the future of human-machine interaction is full of possibility and promise, but any powerful technology needs careful deployment. the joint statement below represents a step towards building a community to address the global challenges presented by ai progress, and we encourage other organizations who would like to participate to get in touch. joint recommendation for language model deployment weâre recommending several key principles to help providers of large language models (llms) mitigate the risks of this technology in order to achieve its full promise to augment human capabilities. while these principles were developed specifically based on our experience with providing llms through an api, we hope they will be useful regardless of release strategy (such as open-sourcing or use within a company). we expect these recommendations to change significantly over time because the commercial uses of llms and accompanying safety considerations are new and evolving. we are actively learning about and addressing llm limitations and avenues for misuse, and will update these principles and practices in collaboration with the broader community over time. weâre sharing these principles in hopes that other llm providers may learn from and adopt them, and to advance public discussion on llm development and deployment. prohibit misuse publish usage guidelines and terms of use of llms in a way that prohibits material harm to individuals, communities, and society such as through spam, fraud, or astroturfing. usage guidelines should also specify domains where llm use requires extra scrutiny and prohibit high-risk use-cases that arenât appropriate, such as classifying people based on protected characteristics. build systems and infrastructure to enforce usage guidelines . this may include rate limits, content filtering, application approval prior to production access, monitoring for anomalous activity, and other mitigations. mitigate unintentional harm proactively mitigate harmful model behavior . best practices include comprehensive model evaluation to properly assess limitations, minimizing potential sources of bias in training corpora, and techniques to minimize unsafe behavior such as through learning from human feedback. document known weaknesses and vulnerabilities , such as bias or ability to produce insecure code, as in some cases no degree of preventative action can completely eliminate the potential for unintended harm. documentation should also include model and use-case-specific safety best practices.â thoughtfully collaborate with stakeholders build teams with diverse backgrounds and solicit broad input. diverse perspectives are needed to characterize and address how language models will operate in the diversity of the real world, where if unchecked they may reinforce biases or fail to work for some groups. publicly disclose lessons learned regarding llm safety and misuse in order to enable widespread adoption and help with cross-industry iteration on best practices. treat all labor in the language model supply chain with respect . for example, providers should have high standards for the working conditions of those reviewing model outputs in-house and hold vendors to well-specified standards (e.g. ensuring labelers are able to opt out of a given task). as llm providers, publishing these principles represents a first step in collaboratively guiding safer large language model development and deployment. we are excited to continue working with each other and with other parties to identify other opportunities to reduce unintentional harms from and prevent malicious use of language models. support from other organizations âwhile llms hold a lot of promise, they have significant inherent safety issues which need to be worked on. these best practices serve as an important step in minimizing the harms of these models and maximizing their potential benefits.â - anthropicâ âas large language models (llms) have become increasingly powerful and expressive, risk mitigation becomes increasingly important. we welcome these and other efforts to proactively seek to mitigate harms and highlight to users areas requiring extra diligence. the principles outlined here are an important contribution to the global conversation.â â john bansemer, director of the cyberai project and senior fellow, center for security and emerging technology (cset) ""google affirms the importance of comprehensive strategies in analyzing model and training data to mitigate the risks of harm, bias, and misrepresentation. it is a thoughtful step taken by these ai providers to promote the principles and documentation towards ai safety."" - google. ""to realize the promise of large language models, we must continue to collaborate as an industry and share best practices for how to responsibly develop and deploy them while mitigating potential risks. we welcome this and other efforts that drive thoughtful and practical action across the industry, learning from and working with key stakeholders in academia, civil society, and government."" â microsoft âthe safety of foundation models, such as large language models, is a growing social concern.â  we commend cohere, openai, and ai21 labs for taking a first step to outline high-level principles for responsible development and deployment from the perspective of model developers.â  there is still much work to be done, and we believe it is essential to engage more voices from academia, industry, and civil society to develop more detailed principles and community norms. as we state in our recent blog post , it is not just the end result but the legitimacy of the process that matters.â - percy liang, director of the stanford center for research on foundation models (crfm) if youâre developing language models or are working to mitigate their risks, weâd love to talk with you. please reach out [ bestpractices@ai21.com ]. about the author enjoyed this?

https://www.ai21.com/blog/zero-to-production-in-ai21-studio,"zero-to-production: bootstrapping a custom model in ai21 studio tutorial zero-to-production: bootstrapping a custom model in ai21 studio learn how to develop a text-based ai application in ai21 studio and grow it from prototype to production using custom jurassic-1 models introduction in this blogpost, we walk through a case study demonstrating how you can build production-grade language applications quickly and effortlessly using ai21 studio. we use a simple text classification use-case as our guiding example, but the same process can be applied to a wide variety of language tasks. we start by introducing the task and implementing a baseline solution using prompt engineering with jurassic-1. although prompt engineering is a quick and straightforward method for building a proof-of-concept, it has some key limitations, which we highlight in detail below. to address these limitations, we implement a better solution by training a custom model specifically for our example task. ai21 studioâs custom models are tailored for optimal performance on a given task and can be economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. even more importantly, custom models are easy to set up and use! custom models in ai21 studio require remarkably little data for training ; most tasks can be addressed successfully by training a model on as few as 50-100 examples. this dramatically lowers the entry barrier for training a state-of-the-art language model of your own, to power your app with excellent quality results. your trained custom model is served in ai21 studio and it is immediately available for use, making integration in your application as easy as performing an api query. our example task: classifying news article topics as a guiding example throughout this blogpost, we will use a well known natural language processing (nlp) task: classifying the topics of news articles. specifically, we follow the ag news task formulation, where articles are classified based on their title and their summary into one of four categories: âworldâ, âsportsâ, âbusinessâ or âscience and technologyâ. for example, consider the following sample of three examples from the ag news training set: examples of news article titles and summaries from the agâ news training set, first introduced by zhang et al (2015) and available online here . the correct labels for examples 1-3 above are âbusinessâ, âsportsâ and âworldâ, respectively. prompt engineering solution jurassic-1 language models are trained to predict likely continuations for a piece of input text, called a âpromptâ. we will use this ability to our advantage, by feeding the model with manually crafted prompts that give rise to a specific behavior in the model output; in our case, weâd like the model to output correct labels for articles. the practice of composing a suitable prompt for a specific task is commonly referred to as âprompt engineeringâ . a common and effective prompt engineering approach is to construct a prompt containing a sequence of correctly labeled examples, often called a âfew-shot promptâ . the goal of a few-shot prompt is to cause the model to latch on to the correct relation between inputs (for our task - title and summary) and outputs (topic label). we built a few-shot prompt for our use-case according to best practices, as described in detail in the appendix . we measured the accuracy of predictions on the ag news test set, while varying the number of examples in the prompt. the results are reported in the table below. note that as we increase the number of examples, the models tend to perform better. this is typically the case with few-shot prompts. using j1-jumbo, we reach a respectable accuracy of 86% for a 16-example prompt. ag news test set accuracy for jurassic-1 models using prompt engineering while varying the number of examples in the prompt. why go beyond prompt engineering? we were able to get impressive performance on our task with a very simple method and a tiny dataset of 16 examples (4 per class). this is excellent, but there are several reasons not to be content with our prompt engineering-based solution. first and most obvious, few-shot prompts can become rather long as the number of examples is increased. this means that on each new prediction the model must read and process the entire prompt, increasing the compute time and resulting in higher latency, energy consumption and cost per prediction. since adding examples to the prompt improves accuracy considerably, we are left with an inconvenient tradeoff between quality and cost, making it challenging to serve production-scale traffic with prompt engineering-based solutions. furthermore, language models have a maximum allowed input length. jurassic-1 models can handle up to 2048 tokens (or roughly 2300-2500 english words), counting both the prompt and the generated text. although impressive, this might not be enough in many cases. imagine if instead of using a short summary of an article, we wanted to use the full article body as the input to our topic classification task. in such a case it would be hard to fit more than 1 or 2 examples into the prompt, so we wouldnât have even one example per topic (recall we want to distinguish between 4 topics). alternatively, had we needed to categorize article summaries into one of 100 potential topics, we would have had a similar problem. even if we make the most out of prompt engineering, we may require even better accuracy. suppose we wanted to break the 90% barrier; judging by our results so far, this might be a tall order for prompt engineering. finally, we note that custom models have safety advantages. since they are trained to perform a particular task, it is harder for a malicious user to abuse access to a custom model. we give an example of this in the appendix . in the next section we introduce custom models as a more precise, scalable and cost-effective alternative to prompt engineering, which allows us to overcome the limitations described above. custom model solution custom models are specialized versions of the general purpose models which we have been using so far, trained to deliver optimal results on a given task. by combining our powerful jurassic-1 language models with our special training techniques, ai21 studio allows you to train a capable model using only a small amount of data, and makes it very easy to query your model once itâs trained. to train a custom model of your own, all you need to do is provide us with a small dataset of correctly solved examples, and we will do the rest. the quality of results you get from a custom model depends on the amount and the quality of training data you provide. as a starting point for most tasks, we recommend using 50-100 examples, since we find this is often enough to achieve great results. so, if you can get your hands on a few dozen examples, we recommend you try our custom models. even if you donât have data at all, we have a few tricks you can use - see the appendix for more details. to pick up where we left our topic classification case study, we trained custom models for ag news while varying the number of examples in the training set. the resulting accuracy on the ag news test set is shown in the table below. as you can see, with as few as 10 examples our custom modelâs accuracy is comparable to j1-large with a few-shot prompt. we also see that adding more training examples results in better accuracy for our custom model, surpassing j1-jumboâs few-shot performance with only 80 training examples. ag news test set accuracy for custom jurassic-1 models trained on datasets varying in size. custom models really start to shine when we take latency into consideration. feeding the general purpose j1-jumbo model with an engineered prompt consisting of 16 examples, we got an accuracy of 86%, and the typical processing time in this case is ~250 milliseconds. a custom model that matches or exceeds this accuracy only needs to process the summary and title of the individual example weâre labeling; there is no need to include a lengthy prompt in every request, because the task-specific behavior is already baked into the model. as a consequence, our custom model can process a typical request in less than 50 milliseconds, offering a greater than 5x speedup compared to prompt engineering . appendix: engineering the prompt an easy way to start engineering a prompt is to feed the model with simple instructions for the required task, such as the following: to predict the label for a given article, we could input the text above followed by the article title, its summary, and a heading that prompts the model to output the correct label as a completion. the full prompt using this scheme follows below. we can replace the text highlighted in blue with the relevant title and summary for any inference example weâd like to label and let the model generate a continuation after âthe topic of this article is:â. this is commonly referred to as a âzero-shot promptâ , because the model is expected to correctly perform the task without feeding it any correctly solved example. using the prompt above, j1-large has an accuracy of 32% and j1-jumbo gets 56.9% on the ag news test set; although significantly better than a random guess accuracy, this leaves much to be desired. the zero-shot approach can be improved upon by adding a number of correctly labeled examples to the prompt itself, making it a â few-shot promptâ . jurassic-1 models recognize and imitate patterns in text, so including a few solved examples in the prompt helps reinforce the desired relation between inputs (title and summary) and outputs (topic label); this usually improves prediction accuracy. a few-shot prompt using the sample of three articles above is shown below. as in the zero-shot case, it will end with the inference example specified in the same uniform format, so the text highlighted in blue will be replaced with the appropriate content for the inference example. once weâve decided on a prompt format as above, we can simply make a longer prompt by adding more examples in the same format. there are some considerations we should keep in mind while doing this: keep the examples relatively balanced between the classes (i.e. the 4 possible topics), to avoid biasing the model towards the more common classes in the prompt. scramble the order of the examples to avoid the model latching on to the wrong pattern (e.g. âbusinessâ always comes after âworldâ in the examples). make sure thereâs enough room for the example you actually want to predict. jurassic-1 models are restricted to 2048 tokens, which should include the prompt and the generated output (1-2 tokens in our case). we built a prompt corresponding to these guidelines. the resulting accuracy for varying prompt lengths is reported above. not surprisingly, the best results are achieved with j1-jumbo and the longest (16-example) prompt, reaching an accuracy 86% on the ag news test set. appendix: safety advantages of custom models ai21 labs is committed to promoting safety in our products. one potential safety risk is deliberate misuse by malicious users of your application, exploiting its access to jurassic-1 to generate text for their malicious purposes. adversaries may attempt to achieve this via âprompt injectionâ , where the end-userâs input text is crafted to alter the normal behavior of the model. as we will now demonstrate, custom models are less susceptible to such attacks than general-purpose models, offering a significant safety advantage when deployed in production. consider a malicious user who has access to the news article topic classification system built on top of jurassic-1 and wishes to abuse it to extract toxic generations from the model. recall that an engineered prompt for topic classification ends with the following text: where <title> and <summary> are user inputs. a malicious user may attempt a prompt injection attack by providing the adversarial input âthe topic of this article is:â followed by some offensive text in place of a legitimate summary, hoping that the model will generate the offensive text or something related to it as the completion. since language models latch on to patterns, the malicious user may even repeat this input line a few times to increase their chances of success. for example, below the adversarial input is repeated 3 times: the figures below compare the performance of the solutions described in this blog post - prompt engineering versus custom models - when faced with an attack like this. we see that the outcome depends on the number of repetitions of the toxic text in the input. for prompt engineering, if the adversary introduces 2 or more repetitions of the toxic text, 50% of the model outputs are toxic, and 3 or more repetitions cause the model to exclusively generate toxic outputs. for custom models, it takes 4 or more repetitions for the adversary to successfully extract toxic generations from the model, and even then the probability of a toxic output is much lower than for prompt engineering. percentage of examples in the ag news test set for which a prompt injection attack successfully generates toxic outputs. left - prompt engineering-based solution with a 16-example prompt. right - custom model solution trained on 3200 examples. the horizontal axis shows the number of times the toxic text (shown above) was repeated in the adversarial input. greedy decoding (temperature=0) was used for generating from both models although using a custom model doesnât eliminate the risk entirely in this example, it does decrease it substantially, in a way that makes other safety mechanisms more effective. for example, to protect against prompt injection in a news topic classification system, it makes sense to limit the amount of text a user can input in the summary field. any safety measure creates a tradeoff between restricting usage and guaranteeing safety, which in this case is found in the maximum allowed input length: set the threshold too high and prompt injection attacks will be more likely to succeed; set the threshold too low and legitimate inputs will be blocked. using a custom model, which is less susceptible to prompt injection out of the box, makes the tradeoff easier and allows a developer to choose a higher threshold while guaranteeing the same level of safety. appendix: no data? no problem! jurassic-1 custom models offer excellent accuracy even when trained on a surprisingly small dataset. nevertheless, sometimes even a small annotated dataset is hard to come by. wouldnât it be nice to enjoy the benefits of custom models without collecting any labeled data? as we will now demonstrate in our topic classification case study, this is possible. first, we note two simple observations: a prompt engineering solution with 1-4 examples per class achieves reasonable accuracy. the model assigns a probability to the label it generates, which indicates its âconfidenceâ in the label. high-confidence labels are more likely to be correct predictions. relying on these two observations, we propose the following simple approach: collect many unlabeled input examples for topic classification. use a prompt engineering-based solution to automatically label them with j1-jumbo. filter the auto-labeled examples by confidence, resulting in a dataset of examples where the model assigns >85% probability to the labels it predicted. make sure the different classes are equally represented in the dataset.â train a custom model on the high-confidence auto-labeled dataset. the table below shows the test set accuracy of custom models trained using this approach. we varied the number of labeled examples in the few-shot prompt, and used it to auto-label 160 examples for training. with just 4 labeled examples (1 per class), we beat j1-jumboâs accuracy with an engineered prompt containing 8 labeled examples. using 16 labeled examples (4 per class) to auto-label a 160-example dataset, we not only beat j1-jumbo but also match the performance of a custom model trained on 160 manually labeled examples (88.5%). ag news test set accuracy for custom jurassic-1 models trained on 160 auto-labeled examples, while varying the number of manually labeled examples in the few-shot prompt used for auto-labeling. accuracy of j1-jumbo with a few-shot prompt utilizing the same amount of labeled data is shown for comparison. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to

shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now

summarization, idea generation, classification and many other language tasks in this blog post we showcase different ways of using ai21 studio and jurassic-1 to perform different language tasks. we hope these will help you kickstart your applications, and even inspire you to come up with ideas for new use cases. for convenience, the examples are grouped into categories, though this grouping doesnât follow very strict rules. make sure to check out the last group of fun examples for some laughs! all of the examples below use prompts we crafted manually, and they are available in ai21 studio as presets, so you can try them yourself, tinker with them and use them as a basis for your own prompts. prompt engineering, the process of composing a prompt to perform a specific task, is a fast, easy, and flexible way to build a demo or prototype. in fact, the prompts weâre sharing here are the product of one day's work, at most. to take your application beyond proof-of-concept, we recommend you train a custom model. custom models in ai21 studio can be trained on very small datasets with as few as 50-100 examples. they offer better precision and latency and can be more economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. read our blog post to learn more about bootstrapping your own custom model. summarizing or simplifying text jurassic-1 is great at applying different transformations to existing text - consuming some text and then generating a piece of text that relates to it. one common transformation is summarization. summarization has many business use-cases, such as extracting the gist of online restaurant reviews: try it live in ai21 studio note that the model successfully follows the style of the example provided in the prompt, and outputs a sequence of short 2-3 word phrases summarizing the review. in a practical setting, we can imagine this method being used to squeeze reviews for display on small mobile devices. another useful transformation is simplifying text to make it more readable and accessible. a useful application could be rephrasing a sentence to avoid business jargon: try it live in ai21 studio or more explicitly, using jurassic-1 to explain the meaning of a word in context: try it live in ai21â studio ideation and copywriting jurassic-1 can be used to augment human creativity in content creation, marketing, ecommerce and even creative writing. by priming our model with titles for blog posts about ai and tourism, we can generate plausible ideas for new blog posts about another topic of our choosing: try it live in ai21 studio humor and sarcasm are nuanced and notoriously hard for ai models to produce. nevertheless, it turns out you can feed article topics into the model and get it to generate funny headlines: try it live in ai21 studio another useful application is writing one-sentence product descriptions for marketing and ecommerce. in the following example, jurassic-1 generates a short description based on a product name and a list of features: try it live in ai21 studio generating code jurassic-1 models can process not only english text but also code in a variety of programming languages. we can use this to translate plain english descriptions into correct python one-liners: try it live in ai21 studio or even translate entire functions from one programming language to another: try it live in ai21 studio working with tables text often comes in a structured format, like a table. below are two examples that show how jurassic-1 can both extract information from a table and generate a properly formatted table from natural language: try it live in ai21 studio try it live in ai21 studio these two examples highlight the flexibility of jurassic-1âs universal âtext-in, text-outâ interface. the model properly handles various forms of text data out of the box, freeing developers to focus on core functionality instead of worrying about format conversions. classification most use-cases above were generative in nature, meaning they involve generating a phrase, sentence, line of code etc. another important subset of language tasks are text classification tasks, where the goal is to label a piece of text. for instance, consider topic classification. the following example demonstrates classifying news articles based on their title and their summary: try it live in ai21 studio note there are four categories - âworldâ, âsportsâ, âbusinessâ or âscience and technologyâ - and we specify them explicitly in the prompt. the model then outputs these as the classification labels. we can use the same idea to perform binary classification. in this example the model determines whether a certain attribute indicates a high or low level of openness (one of the big five personality traits in psychology): try it live in ai21 studio this time, the two possible labels (âhighâ and âlowâ) arenât spelled out in the prompt, and the model picks them up from the examples. world knowledge because it was trained on a massive amount of text, jurassic-1 acquired knowledge about different topics. by composing a suitable prompt, we can retrieve facts encoded in the model in natural language form. itâs often a good idea to build a q&a or âinterviewâ style prompt for this, like the one we use in the following example to answer sports trivia questions: try it live in ai21 studio a different kind of knowledge is common sense knowledge. in this example we probe the modelâs ability to predict outcomes of different actions according to common sense: try it live in ai21 studio itâs important to keep in mind that the coverage and accuracy of knowledge encoded in jurassic-1 may vary depending on factors such as time, topic and geography, and may also reflect bias found in the human-written texts the model was trained on. in particular, donât expect the model to possess highly domain-specific knowledge. furthermore, note that the model doesnât have any knowledge of current events, since it was trained on texts dated up to year 2020. other fun examples finally, weâd like to share a few fun examples, built by members of our team on a one-day internal hackathon. these projects were primarily designed to make you laugh, but we hope they also help you imagine the opportunities that ai21 studio unlocks for media, content creation, human-computer interaction and many other industries. jurassic-1 write rap lyrics the team used jurassic-1 to generate lyrics for rap songs about historical figures. the inspiration is, of course, the musical hamilton. they primed the model with lyrics about alexander hamilton, george washington (both from âhamiltonâ) and eva perã³n (from âevitaâ). then they had the model generate new lyrics about barack obama. note that they didnât explicitly provide the model with any of the biographical information about obama, so all the knowledge (harvard law, michelle, chicago etc.) is encoded within the model itself. once they had the lyrics, they packaged them nicely in a video using an off-the-shelf deep fake engine that supports rap, added a beat, et viola. â jurades:â aiâ charades powered by jurassic-1 in this game, players take turns trying to communicate the identity of random famous characters, without stating their names, following the standard rules of charades. unlike a normal game of charades, the one responsible for guessing the the characters' identities is not a human, but a language model... jurassic-1! the model is fed with a few-shot prompt that taps into its world knowledge and text comprehension capabilities. jurassic-1 is surprsingly good at understanding non-coherent, associative descriptions that humans make under pressure. the prompt is set up to allow the model to self-correct based on failed guesses and follow up hints. â jurassichess continuing our games theme, jurassichess uses jurassic-1 to give you verbal feedback on your chess moves, by integrating it with stockfish , an open-source chess ai. when you play against stockfish, it provides a score that represents the strength of your position as well as the aiâs suggestions for the best alternative move ( in chess notation ). we feed this information into jurassic-1 and use specific prompts to generate relevant positive, negative or neutral feedback, resulting in a responsive ai chess tutor experience. and if you donât mind a little trash-talking, a different set of prompts gives your ai opponent a way to taunt you. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went wrong while submitting the form. mrkl whitepaper paper: standing on the shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâre thankful for the reception it got â over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canât access your company database, donât have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canât reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donât come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâs how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of âgreen energy companiesâ is routed to wiki api, âlast monthâ dates are extracted from the calendar and âshare pricesâ from the database. the âlargest increaseâ is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâs easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâs payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can âtalkâ to your data to explore what you need- â âfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ, âwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâs leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - âwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâs transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly.

t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - âdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canât know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [âreturn population of tel avivâ; return population of berlinâ; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â #1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâm going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks?
