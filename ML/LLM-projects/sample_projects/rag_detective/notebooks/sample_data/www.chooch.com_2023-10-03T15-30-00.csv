Whether you are using the web interface or creating your own model integrated with an Object Detector, ensure your prompts are free of typos, grammar errors, and straight-forward to understand. For the best results we recommend using prompts that are full sentences and end in a question mark. Instead of: is there fire Try: Is there fire or smoke in this image? Instead of: do you see corrosion Try: Is there corrosion in this image? In addition, refrain from making run-on prompts that can be confusing to ImageChat, for instance: Is there fire or smoke or anything that might be dangerous in this image? Instead, try multiple specific prompts such as: Is there fire or smoke in this image? Is there dry brush in this image? As you test and prompt ImageChat you will find that high-quality prompts can positively impact the accuracy of the results. If you are not seeing the results you are expecting, try adjusting your prompts slightly and test again. For instance, you can add the keyword “possible” to your prompt to allow a more sensitive detection from ImageChat: Is there possible rust in this image? In addition, including the phrase in this image? can help ImageChat understand your prompt better. Instead of: Is there fire? Try: Is there fire in this image? If you have any questions on prompting or would like additional help from the Chooch Team, don’t hesitate to reach out at [email protected] ImageChat API Our cutting-edge ensemble model combines computer vision and large language models to provide you with the best possible results. Both ImageChat and Custom ImageChat models are available via API access for automating prompting and analysis in your pipeline. ImageChat API Below are code examples of using the ImageChat API. The API includes additional parameters to fine-tune your API call and ensure the best analysis. ImageChat Parameters: model_id: The ID of the ImageChat-3 model used to generate the predictions. model_title: The title of the ImageChat-3 model used to generate the predictions. predictions: The predictions made on the input image, provided as a list. Each prediction includes a class title, score, prediction keywords, and coordinates. prompt: The prompt given to the model to generate the predictions. image_width: The width of the input image in pixels. image_height: The height of the input image in pixels. image_id: The ID of the input image. workflow_predict_objects_only: (Optional) When set to True, ImageChat will only look at the objects detected rather than the whole image. workflow_class_filter: (Optional) This will only include the classes you explicitly state in the results. workflow_padding: (Optional) Padding percentage will add extra space within the bounding box detections. workflow_conf_thresh: (Optional) This will adjust the confidence threshold of the object detector and only show objects above the set threshold. Accepts values between 0.01 – 1.0. workflow_nms_thresh: (Optional) This will adjust the non-max suppression threshold of the object detector. Non-max suppression removes possible duplicate bounding boxes if they overlap with other detections Accepts values between 0.01 – 1.0.

Each imaging system captures its own images or videos, and then sends them to a hosted inference engine running AI models. Using Chooch’s computer vision API, these two systems can establish a standard protocol for communication. The host machine then takes the input image or video, runs it through the model, and sends the results back to the requester within a fraction of a second.

For error messages see last section. predictions: Predictions made on the image. Predictions are provided as a pst and have class_title and order fields. class_title is the name of the class predicted, and order is the order of relevancy of the particular class. sub_predictions: Predictions made under dense classification. The image or frame is segmented into parts and classified based on the segments. text_value: Text predictions. face_name: Facial recognition name predictions. face_count: Sum of faces. coordinates: Coordinates of the object based on pixels. The format for the coordinates is X1, X2, Y1, Y2. count: The number of times an object or concept appears in an image or a frame. fileid: Unique File ID created for the image. The File ID is to identify the image for future references.

For every cpent a personal FTP host is issued together with the API. FTP Host: ftp://52.207.237.100 API Key: 6werc42-1675-6553-8105 The FTP drop sends the image to the API. The API predicts the image and places the results in the keywords field of the IPTC metadata file. Once the metadata has been successfully placed into the keywords fields of the IPTC file, it is sent to the destination directed by the user.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/imagechat-the-latest-in-image-to-text-generative-ai/,"ImageChat | Image-To-Text Generative AI | Chat with Images While the evolution of natural language processing has made remarkable advancements in recent years, large language models (LLM) have not been particularly useful in analyzing visual information in photos, videos, and other images. ImageChat , is the latest image-to-text generative AI technology. And it’s a game changer. ImageChat is Chooch’s latest cutting-edge model that analyzes images and provides more detailed insights into visual images with staggering accuracy in most use cases. An ensemble of LLM and computer vision AI models make it capable of recognizing over 40 million visual elements. It’s providing enterprises a revolutionary way to build computer vision models using text prompts. Detecting wildfires with ImageChat AI One of the first ImageChat deployments is in the detection of wildfires. As we are all aware, wildfires in California can cause significant damage and pose a serious threat to people and property. ImageChat is deployed on 1000 ground station video streams, providing unprecedented accuracy in smoke detection. ImageChat also generates language descriptions of images, providing organizations with additional information about the detected elements. For example, in the wildfire case, the model identifies the location of the smoke in the camera frame and a confidence value of the detection, discerning haze, fog and other related events from actual smoke. This information allows organizations to make certain every possible detection is being evaluated with very few false positives. When computer vision meets large language models Trained on over 11 billion parameters and 400 million images, ImageChat-1 is a dramatic step into the future, bridging the gap between language and visual information. This type of intelligence, where machines can comprehend visual data using language, is taking the computer vision category to a much higher level of sophistication. The ImageChat model is built on Chooch’s proprietary architecture, which uses a transformer-based neural network, pre-trained on vast amounts of visual and language data combined with object detectors to generate localized, highly accurate detection of the most subtle nuances in images for any enterprise use case. ImageChat can analyze images and frames of video by breaking them down into individual components, such as objects, people, and locations, providing detailed descriptions that can be queried with language prompts from a user or automatically via an API. ImageChat is the future of image-to-text generative AI ImageChat is a profound milestone – the intersection of computer vision and language. With its remarkable precision, this technology has the potential to transform how we interpret video streams and images and extract valuable insights from them. Chooch anticipates enterprises will soon build their own ImageChat models using their unique visual and language data on top of the foundational ImageChat model. It will be instrumental in safeguarding and disseminating critical enterprise information to all stakeholders, ensuring business continuity and growth. ImageChat is available to Chooch enterprise customers for deployment on any existing camera system. For those who want to try it out, ImageChat is also available as a free app on iOS and Android .

https://www.chooch.com/blog/how-to-use-ai-computer-vision-for-wildfire-detection/,"How to Use AI Computer Vision for Wildfire Detection | Chooch Images of burning wildland areas across the world are now familiar sights in the media especially during the summer and fall. In the United States alone, there is an average of over 70,000 wildfires each year , but worse yet, studies have shown that the annual acreage burned is over 60% larger than decades ago . Wildfires are becoming more devastating over time, and federal, state, and local agencies are struggling to keep up. Due to the land management complexities across government agencies, understanding who will fund this specific kind of disaster response is an enormous challenge for legislators and emergency agencies. Often state reimbursement from federal funds for wildfire recovery. A 2021 study by the Brookings Institution estimated that $7 from the federal government went to disaster recovery for every dollar in fire preparedness spending. Any way you look at it, early wildfire  detection and responsiveness is the most prudent way to being minimizing the  i fiscal, environmental, and human expense toll. The National Institute of Building Sciences estimates that every dollar invested in wildfire mitigation saved $3 in post-disaster recovery costs . Investment in immediate response protocols and tools that leverage the latest technologies are foundational for early detection and of fires. We sit at a unique inflection point where computers are smaller and more powerful than ever. Cameras can see greater distances with higher resolution in less light. AI computer vision is far more advanced and quickly becoming mainstream thanks to tools like Chat-GPT. Use of this technology working alongside the men and women in fire protection is gaining wider adoption. The case for computer vision as an essential investment in wildland fire detection The subset of AI called computer vision is easily identifying objects, people, and activities in images derived from live video streams. Such intelligence can “see” images and understand their context by leveraging computing frameworks like deep neural networks and transformers. In the past, such technology has been less mobile. The electrical, processing, and networking power was insufficient to derive real value from computer vision algorithms in ultra dynamic, real-world settings. Today, these algorithms can be deployed from cameras on cell towers, unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones to provide always-on monitoring of wide expanses of remote geography. Computer vision AI platforms, like Chooch AI Vision , are optimized for remote deployments out-of-the-box and maintain highly accurate fire detection algorithms that can distinguish smoke from clouds, fog, and other atmospheric conditions. Today, computer vision for wildfire detection is no longer an interesting experiment. It’s a robust and reliable technology capable of running on existing cameras and hardware and accurately detecting wildfires across thousands of cameras. It’s being used right now on over 2,000 cameras in California . In less than a second, smoke is accurately identified across a vast plain of imagery with false positives numbering in the single digits out of thousands of images every minute. Now is the time to make computer vision a foundational capability in any wildfire mitigation strategy. Key components of a computer vision system for wildfire detection A computer vision system for wildfire detection typically consists of three main components: image acquisition and processing, feature extraction and pattern recognition, and machine learning algorithms. Let’s take a closer look at each of these components. Image acquisition and processing Image acquisition and processing  involves capturing images of the environment using cameras and then processing those images to extract relevant information. Cameras can be placed on towers, drones, or other platforms to capture images at regular intervals. Once the images are captured, they can be processed using image processing technology to enhance their quality and extract features that are relevant for wildfire detection. Feature extraction and pattern recognition Feature extraction and patter recognition involves using algorithms to extract specific features from images, such as color, texture, and shape. These features are then used to identify patterns that  indicate a wildfire. For example, algorithms may be trained to recognize the shape of a smoke plume or the color of flames, which would indicate the presence of a fire. Machine learning algorithms for wildfire detection The third component of a computer vision system for wildfire detection involves machine learning algorithms. These algorithms use patterns identified in the image data to predict whether a wildfire is present or not. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on a large dataset of images that include both wildfire and non-wildfire images, enabling them to recognize patterns that are indicative of a wildfire and make more accurate predictions Real-world applications of computer vision in wildfire detection Computer vision has several real-world applications that can help detect wildfires. These include satellite imagery and remote sensing, drone-based monitoring systems, and ground-based camera networks. Satellite imagery and remote sensing Satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies can provide high-resolution imagery of vast areas, enabling authorities to monitor wildfires across a wider geography. Some satellite imagery providers can even detect wildfires in near real-time, allowing authorities to respond quickly before the situation escalates. Drone-based monitoring systems Drone-based monitoring systems allow for rapid deployment of cameras to areas where fires are likely to occur, reducing response times and improving situational awareness. Drones can also be equipped with thermal cameras that detect heat signatures, allowing them to identify fires that may not be visually visible from the air. Ground-based camera networks Ground-based camera networks can also be used for wildfire detection . These systems typically consist of a network of cameras placed at tactical locations. These cameras can capture high-resolution images at regular intervals and then transmit those images to a central processing system for analysis. Overcoming challenges of using computer vision for wildfire detection Using computer vision for wildfire detection is not a new idea, but there were several core challenges that previously plagued its application at scale. Fortunately, forward momentum in hardware and algorithmic design have made computer vision both a trustworthy and robust solution ready for the field. Image quality and resolution In the past, image quality and resolution of images used for wildfire detection have sometimes impacted the accuracy of AI systems . Because cameras are exposed to the elements, cracked lenses and variable lighting made it difficult to distinguish fire and smoke from clouds, haze, or fog. A key revolution that has solved for these variables is the popularization of “transformer” models or self-attention models. Such AI algorithms specialize in maintaining positional context in an image, so the placement of fire and smoke can today be reliably deciphered amongst other occlusions or objects. False positives and negatives False positives and negatives have been challenges in using computer vision for wildfire detection . False positives occur when the system detects a fire when no fire exists, while false negatives occur when the system fails to detect a real fire. Modern fire detection algorithms err on the side of caution and likely trigger more false positives than negatives. Because AI is only as good as its training data, it’s imperative to train AI with similar vantage points as the real-world applications. The latest AI models, such as ImageChat ™ by Chooch , use billions of parameters to fine-tune varieties of training data, ensuring that the models account for the maximum number of edge scenarios. Scalability and real-time processing Finally, scalability and real-time processing can be challenging for computer vision systems used for wildfire detection. The sheer volume of data generated by cameras can be overwhelming, requiring significant processing power and storage capacity. In addition, the system must be able to process the data quickly and in real-time, alerting authorities to the presence of a fire as quickly as possible, b ut today’s computers are more powerful than ever in history. Graphics processing units, or GPUs, are equipped with over 50 billion transistors. Simply, hardware is more mobile and can handle more logic than previously imagined. Also, new data management paradigms adopted by telecom providers with the roll-out of 5G communications has optimized the way only critical data is sent over a network making close-proximity processing a reality for standard hardware tools. Use case studies and success stories for AI in wildfire detection There are several examples of successful AI-powered wildfire detection systems which have been deployed today. For example, the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System (FIRIS) uses real-time data from sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect wildfires in California. The Rapid Wildfire Detection Using Satellite Data (RAPID) system uses satellite imagery and AI algorithms to detect wildfires in real-time. Other examples include the NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) web-based tool and UC San Diego’s project for real-time fire detection, ALERTCalifornia . Collaborative efforts and partnerships Collaborative efforts between government agencies, research institutions, and private companies are essential for developing effective wildfire detection and prevention strategies. By sharing data and expertise, these groups work together to create comprehensive solutions that are tailored to specific regions and environments. By leveraging the power of AI, computer vision, and fire detection technologies, we can protect our communities and natural resources from the threat of wildfires. Chooch has been active in this space since 2019 and has state-of-the-art, ReadyNow ™ computer vision models trained to accurately identify smoke and fire in any wilderness image.

SAN MATEO, CA — April 6, 2023 — Chooch, a leading Vision AI firm, has unveiled ImageChat TM , an innovative solution that enables enterprise customers and strategic partners to generate hyper-detailed computer vision models using text prompts. Chooch is highly regarded for its robust AI Vision platform, which uses AI to detect and comprehend the most subtle details in photos, videos, and other images. Now ImageChat takes intelligent image recognition to an even more sophisticated level. With ImageChat, computers say what they see. Try ImageChat here . ImageChat-1 is trained on over 11 billion parameters and 400 million images, with the ability to recognize more than 40 million visual details. By leveraging both AI Vision and large language models, ImageChat significantly improves data reliability and accuracy, making it particularly useful for use cases that require object detection and detailed reasoning. It is not only capable of generating detailed captions and keywords within images and video streams, but it is also purpose-built so that users can “chat” with any image, deriving deeper insights, and obtaining valuable information from images and video streams, much of which may not be obvious to humans. People can type in questions about images, and the images “chat” back specific answers.

https://www.chooch.com/newsfeed/chooch-ai-eyeing-future-public-listing-executive-says/,"Chooch Eyeing Future Public Listing | Chooch News / Latest News Chooch Eyeing Future Public Listing Chooch , a company that tracks objects and actions using artificial intelligence, could pursue a public listing “soon” or in a few years, said Michael Liou, vice president of strategy and growth. The San Mateo, California-based company declined to speculate on whether it would pursue a traditional listing, direct listing or a listing via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), saying that it was premature to comment due to the changing landscape of listing processes. Liou pointed to recent volatile IPOs including C3.ai [NYSE:AI], which surged and then crashed and Robinhood [NASDAQ:HOOD], which fell on its first day and then surged by more than 20%. Chooch has not been approached by a SPAC, Liou said, adding that the SPAC market is like “the wild west” and flooded with pre-acquisition SPACs. While some SPACs have been “quite successful,” investors in other blank-check companies are likely “really burning mad” with troubled targets like Nikola [NASDAQ:NKLA], whose former CEO was recently indicted on securities fraud charges. In addition to being a venture capitalist, Liou was an early investor in numerous companies that went public recently including Robinhood, Wish [NASDAQ:WISH] and Didi [NYSE:DIDI], he said. Chooch, founded in 2015, uses AI to track objects for industries including healthcare, defense and energy, the executive said.  To add capabilities, the companies “always” works with partners including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), systems integrators (SIs), and virtual memory systems (VMS) depending on use cases, he added. Its technology can be used in operating rooms or to detect warnings for energy sites that could fail, Liou said. Chooch’s customers operate on a partner ecosystem, he added. The company can create models in a matter of weeks instead of months like other companies, Liou said. During the interview, the executive created and demonstrated a data set of syringes that showed the computer identifying syringes within a mix of other objects. Chooch reaches markets in Europe through partners, such as its presence in the UK through Pendragon , a car reseller that uses Chooch’s technology to improve user uploaded car images, Liou said. The company has received frequent inbound interest from investors, partners and customers in past years from regions like Japan, Latin America and EMEA, he added. Liou anticipates that the company will begin considering expanding strategically once the company gets “some good momentum,” adding that its international push would rely on partnerships. In November 2020, Chooch raised a USD 20m Series A round led by Vickers Venture Partners with additional participation from Streamlined Ventures , 212, Alumni Ventures Group and Waterman Ventures . The cash from the Series A round gives the company “years of runway” outside of the typical 12-18 months between raises, Liou said. The company hopes to improve its free cash flow with revenue from clients and eventually to be cash flow breakeven and essentially self-funded, he added. Although a capital raise isn’t Chooch’s highest priority right now, the company could decide to raise “a little bit more” capital at a higher valuation, the executive said, adding that he has received inbound interest from corporate venture capitalists who are interested in participating in a capital raise before a potential IPO. Broad competitors in the space include Clarifai , Matroid and Dori AI , the executive said. AnyVision , Deep North and C3.ai are niche competitors in the facial recognition, retail and manufacturing and utilities spaces, Liou added. #### For media inquiries, contact [email protected] .

https://www.chooch.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-retail-shelf-management/,"See How AI Transforming Shelf Management in Retail | Chooch You are probably aware of how more sophisticated data analytics is transforming the retail industry . Today across all customer touch points, artificial intelligence is driving the collection of massive amounts of data, and the latest advancements in computer vision technology are defining a modern approach to real-time store management. AI-powered computer vision is enabling retailers to monitor the most subtle images, or changes in images, in any video stream using their existing in-store cameras. Retailers can not only have this modern technology monitor security cameras, but also monitor stockouts, sending instant alerts to store managers when shelves are not properly stocked or could be better stocked based on shopper behavior. Re tailers rely heavily on data to deliver both consumer and supply chain data deriving insights never before available to them. They are prioritizing investment in AI for: Real-time data and insights: They are leveraging massive amounts of data from edge devices to help make real-time decisions and improve operations. Forecasting Changing Demand: Retailers are relying heavily on real-time data to anticipate shifts in demand for countless SKU’s as they improve point of purchase displays and cater to always evolving customer behavior. Personalization: Data at scale provides retailers with deeper customer insights to better improve everything from product placement to marketing personalization. Data sharing: Retailers are creating more transparency across their entire value chains, providing valuable insights to suppliers, distributors, and partners. The best part is that they reduce costs and improve service. Using AI for shelf and stockout management Poor shelf management and stockouts can dramatically reduce sales and have a direct impact on operational costs, employee productivity, and customer satisfaction. Most often, this is simply a result of poor visibility into store settings and shopping behavior. Computer vision is delivering meaningful benefits to retailers. It provides retailers with real-time visibility and insights into store settings, signage, and shelf displays. It delivers advanced monitoring and benchmarking of out-of-stock instances and product merchandising. AI-powered computer vision technology provides the infrastructure for more automated, real-time stock management, dramatically improving store operations. Measurable ROI of retail AI for shelf management How to address on-shelf availability with computer vision Foundational technologies such as barcode scanning, ID scanning, and optical character recognition (OCR) have paved the way for improving shelf-monitoring. These technologies, combined with data from live-streaming cameras, are used to power computer vision models that can detect anomalies in product placement on shelves in real-time with minimal human intervention. Building computer vision models to monitor stock out Creating computer vision models to deliver insights that retailers need requires a large dataset of images of each product SKU. For example, every bag of potato chips and every flavored variety, i.e., sour cream and onion, cheddar cheese, etc., requires unique images. This compilation of images builds the dataset that teaches the computer vision model what each bag of chips looks like and the subtleties between each so that it can understand what to look for on shelves and make predictions based on what it sees. Think of this as “teaching” computers what to see. How synthetic data is helping retailers Grocery stores frequently have 10,000+ items on a given shelf. This product volume makes gathering a large enough dataset of images to train the model incredibly tedious and time consuming. To speed up the process, rather than taking a photo of each product, synthetic data toolsets can be used today to generate images of each item based on their barcodes or UPCs. Manufactured, or “synthetic,” features like object occlusions, diverse backgrounds, lighting, rotations, noise, and blurring are proactively added to copies of images. This process creates a more robust and more accurate data set. It produces computer vision models that can see a much broader variety of product scenarios and are more effective at detecting specific objects or products. Using both real and synthetic data, the models can create a more robust analytical visualization of every product, on every shelf, in every location within the store for maximum visibility into shelf inventory. Now when stockouts occur, products are out of place, or misaligned, automated alerts can be sent to staff in real-time for them to investigate and restock quickly. Automating more of the visual inspection process reduces labor costs and placement errors. Fast responses to stockouts reduce lost sales while improving customer satisfaction and the overall shopping experience. Applications of AI for real-time shelf management Stock replenishment By collecting real-time data on inventory levels and stock movement, retailers can make faster and smarter decisions about how and when to restock shelves, reduce overstocking, and optimize pricing to maximize profit margin. Minimizing under-stocking and dead stock holding costs not only saves money but also streamlines operations and increases profitability. Planogram design AI-powered data and insights assist retailers with optimizing product placement by putting the most popular products in shelf positions based on shopper buying behavior. Computer vision finds patterns in data and aggregates it into heat maps, analyzing customer dwell times and store flow through. Contractual compliance Compliance audits can be time consuming for retailers. Pre-defined compliance metrics, such as on-shelf availability (OSA), share of shelf, and shelf positioning are all part of service level agreements (SLA) between retailers and suppliers . If retailers are found to be violating SLA’s by displaying too few products or by positioning products in the wrong shelf locations, contractual penalties and even contract terminations are possible. Delivering a frictionless shopping experience with AI Brick and mortar retailers continue to face customer acquisition challenges and increasing brand loyalty. Despite the continued growth of online shopping, nothing replaces the experience of walking into a store, browsing the shelves, and finding the product customers want to buy. Delivering a frictionless shopping experience is critical to keeping customers coming back, but low on-shelf availability (OSA) and a high number of out-of-stock events can impact that experience. Chances are if the inventory isn’t available to the customer to buy immediately, they have most likely ordered it from an online retailer before they have left the store. Traditional methods of managing OSA just do not compare to modern technology. Computer vision is changing how retailers are monitoring their shelf space. It provides the data retailers need to better manage product availability, shelf design, pricing, and product placements. Ultimately, It’s better enabling retailers to streamline operations, reduce costs, and deliver exceptional customer experiences.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/the-value-of-edge-ai/,"The Value of Edge AI | Technologies Advancing Edge AI Adoption For the first time in history, our society sits at the convergence of high-powered compute devices capable of running the world’s most advanced AI algorithms in disconnected or environmentally rugged environments. This paradigm shift in computing is referred to as Edge AI, and it’s unlocking a myriad of insights across industries such as manufacturing , retail, and telecom because it unlocks streams of data closest to the point of inception. Much like the cloud computing revolution of the last decade that paved the way to “big data” related problems and innovations, edge computing is becoming the gateway to intelligent processing for side-by-side collaboration with end users. Understanding the types of edge AI What is edge AI? Edge AI refers to the use of artificial intelligence algorithms on devices located close to the source of data generation. This is a contrast to traditional AI, performed in a centralized location, such as cloud servers. By processing data locally, edge AI reduces the amount of data needed to be transferred for processing, making it faster and more efficient. In locations where internet bandwidth is limited – remote areas or mobile networks – there is a growing need for devices to be able to process data quickly and efficiently without relying on a cloud server. What is drone AI? Drone AI is the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones. Drones are equipped with cameras and sensors that allow them to capture data about their surrounding environment, which is then processed by AI algorithms to make better informed decisions about the best course of action. The benefit of using drones is that data can be collected from areas that are difficult or dangerous for humans to access, for example, inspecting oil rigs, monitoring wildlife, and even delivering medical supplies to remote areas. What is edge computer vision? Edge computer vision refers to applying AI to video streams for real-time inference of operational and business intelligence pushed from core compute services to low-resource edge hardware. There are numerous computer vision techniques running at the edge, including image, action, and pattern recognition; object counting and classification; and facial recognition . In all cases, these computer vision techniques run embedded within a non-IT asset, such as a device endpoint (like a smart camera), a gateway device, or on a local edge server. As data is fed from devices into these models, they continue to learn and can adapt to changing conditions. By automatically analyzing vast amounts of data, computer vision algorithms can identify patterns and trends that might not be apparent to human analysts. In identifying these anomalies, most analytics are performed on the edge, and real-time alerts are generated to initiate further action. Using edge AI for security With security risks becoming more sophisticated and, in some cases, catastrophic, security measures today are evolving beyond simple alarms, guards, and surveillance cameras. Technology is advancing common security systems and edge devices to be more sophisticated, utilizing advanced sensors, facial recognition technology, and computer vision. Computer vision models run on edge devices are trained on the data collected to identify different types of security threats, including crowds, loitering, weapons, and vehicles. For example, video footage can be analyzed for a crime as it happens; however, you may not be able to identify the perpetrator if they’re wearing a mask or if they’re not facing the camera directly. Combining computer vision models and facial recognition , multiple data points can be analyzed, such as the shape of a person’s face, the distance between their eyes, and the contours of their features, to identify individuals with a high degree of accuracy. This can all be done real-time with the advancements with running these models at the edge. Technology that’s advancing the adoption of edge AI Enterprises adopting edge AI paradigms have introduced a new set of technological needs that third party vendors or in-house operations must develop to stay at the forefront of edge intelligence.  IT leaders will find themselves in an uphill battle of uncategorized data, which results in poorly performing AI models , data drift, and power and compute capacity constraints without considering the technologies below: Model compression Model compression enables larger, complex algorithms to be deployed in smaller, resource-constrained devices through several different methods such as pruning (weights and filters), quantization, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization techniques. Federated learning as a decentralized environment Decentralized deep learning methodologies, such as federated learning, enhance privacy and data security by leveraging data processing across client’s local networks without exposing training data. This means the data stays on the device and can be encrypted and secured more easily. Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies Networks of connected devices generate unstructured data in vast quantities. This is driving the demand for smart, contract-enabled protocols to protect privacy and authenticity of source data inputs to edge AI algorithms . AI chips and neuromorphic devices being integrated into edge hardware Smaller, more focused AI processors are being installed in CCTV cameras to perform a handful of common AI functions such as people counting, path flow analysis, loitering, and PPE detection; the breadth of these detections increases as more pre-trained AI models and services are offered by third parties. Enabling AI everywhere Organizational demand for actionable insights to improve business operations is driving the adoption of using edge AI. Real-time data processing, data security, and reduced latency delivers new value from proximal data.

The goal of UX design is to create a web application that is both effective and easy to use. To achieve this, UX designers must consider the business problems of their users, possess a high degree of empathy, and be willing to rapidly adjust features upon in-field testing and feedback solicitation. As Chooch’s Product Design Lead, Zeynep drives the overall design and functionality of new features that impact Chooch users. She brings a diverse professional background of management consulting, marketing, and product management across energy and telecom industries into cross-industry computer vision applications. Her mission is to delight Chooch users as they build, host, and deploy their enterprise computer vision solutions. How did you first become interested in UX Design as a profession? After working in the fields of consulting and marketing for many years, I knew that I needed a change, but I didn’t know how to pivot. After some research, I became interested in UX design, but I had a tough time figuring out how to gain practical skills in the field. At the same time, I was also working in the marketing department of a telecommunications company when I found Smartup Network , a software company that helps entrepreneurs and innovative enterprises build mobile and web products. I started working as a Junior Product Manager in the evenings and weekends. I wanted to see if the role was a good fit and realized I really enjoyed developing a tech product, especially the user-facing parts of it. Because I loved the experience so much, I left my current job and started working as a UX designer at Fol Agency specializing in UX/UI. What do you like most about your job? What I like most is the part of my job that involves anticipating human behavior and psychology. Additionally, I love creating a product that serves people’s needs and seeing it being used is extremely satisfying. The opportunity to be able to constantly improve the product and do better through feedback is also something I like. What do you keep in mind as you create an AI product for users across different industries? Designing products for the Chooch platform is very enjoyable for someone who loves challenges, and I’m one of those people. The reason designing any software product is so difficult is that it requires us to address so many different industry needs using one product and maintaining a cohesive user journey while doing that. For Chooch, it is so important we maintain a seamless journey between the Chooch AI Vision Studio, Inference Engine, Smart Analytics, and ImageChat . We are trying to bring together different industries into a common language and make the product more customizable and adaptable. How do you establish user empathy for a platform like Chooch? Our approach to establishing user empathy is to first understand business needs, emotions, and perspectives. We do this by using known methods, which include conducting user research, analyzing user data, continuously testing our product, gathering feedback, and making improvements. One of the most important things we focus on when designing products is to constantly iterate. We all believe that we can improve our designs based on user feedback, which is why we continuously strive to improve. Of course, for platforms like ours, our users include both our partners and their users, our direct customers, and developers, so we must cater to a wide range of primary and secondary personas. What is your main hope for the users of Chooch to understand about the product? My main hope for Chooch users is that they can easily leverage our platform’s powerful AI technology stack to solve their most complex business problems, thus making their work easier, more efficient, and providing them a significant competitive advantage. How has Chooch’s product design changed since you started? Where do you see it going forward? Chooch’s product design has changed a lot and has also improved since I started. We have designed new products from scratch, such as Smart Analytics and ImageChat , and redesigned our existing products based on user experience analysis. Of course, during this time, our logo and colors have also changed, making our updates even more noticeable. As Chooch continues to grow and innovate, I see our product design becoming more user-centric, with an even greater emphasis on simplicity and ease of use despite the perceived complexities of emerging technology. How do you effectively come to product design decisions in a fast-paced AI startup? If you’re doing product design in a fast-paced AI startup, you can’t follow all of the steps of a traditional design methodology for each feature; we simply don’t have the luxury of time. However, I still believe that it is important to at least touch each step in a structured design methodology, even if it’s less detailed. For example, sometimes we can’t complete a detailed conceptual design, so we still meet as a UX and UI team to draw rough sketches in brainstorming sessions. The most important thing is to decide why the desired feature is needed and which user needs it satisfies, and then figure out how all the products will be affected, even if it’s just with pen and paper. When making product design decisions, it’s always important to think from the perspective of what the user needs first – what problem they’re facing then how we can solve it. As always, over time, what the user wants is proven by how they use our features, and we adjust accordingly. What feature that you’ve designed are you most proud of? I don’t have a single feature that I am most proud of; I am proud of our teams’ work creating a platform that users find easy to create AI solutions to solve their problems. At the end of the day, my job is to solve the user’s problem in the most straightforward, simple, and useful manner possible. Where do you see UX design moving towards in the next few years? In the next five years, I believe UX design will continue to evolve and become more focused on creating personalized and immersive experiences for users. Voice-based interfaces, augmented reality, virtual reality, and 3D interfaces will provide more engaging and interactive experiences. There’ll be a greater emphasis on personalization where users will be able to customize their experience based on their preferences and needs. I feel an exciting trend we’ll see much more of is ethical design , which involves designing interfaces that prioritize user privacy and safety. What impact will AI have on UX designer’s role in product development? AI technologies will help UX designers analyze and interpret user data to better understand user behavior and preferences. It will also help with prototyping, testing, and even generating general design solutions. However, AI will not replace UX designers as there will always be gaps in technology that require human intervention and creativity. Want to meet more of the Chooch team? Check out the blogs below.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/what-is-edge-ai/,"What is Edge AI? | Edge Computing | Chooch Edge AI is the intersection of edge computing and artificial intelligence: an AI paradigm that performs as much computation as possible on “edge” devices that are physically located close to the source of the data. This is in contrast to traditional approaches that first upload the data to remote servers running in the cloud, where the computation is then performed. What are the benefits of edge AI over “traditional” Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing methods? The advantages of edge AI include: Greater privacy and security: If data privacy and security are a concern for your organization, edge AI may be the best fit. Data is stored and processed locally, instead of being sent to a third-party cloud computing provider. Improved latency: Since you don’t have to wait for results to come back from the cloud, edge computing has much lower latency. Lower costs: Edge computing saves you money on the costs of data traffic and cloud computing services. Once you purchase the edge device itself, your expenses are fairly low. Better reliability: Edge AI can continue to function even in the event of an outage that disrupts communications or cloud operations. Edge AI is especially useful for resource-intensive applications such as computer vision, which relies heavily on images and videos. There’s no need to pay the costs of sending this visual data to the cloud when you can analyze it yourself on an edge device . Recent technological advancements in CPUs and GPUs have made edge devices more powerful than ever before. This means that it’s easier than ever to run powerful AI models on the edge . What’s more, this trend is only expected to accelerate in the near future. According to the intelligence firm MarketsandMarkets, the global market value of edge AI will skyrocket from $590 million in 2020 to $1.8 billion in 2026 —a blistering annual growth rate of 21 percent.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-and-5g-edge-ai/,"Computer Vision and 5G Edge AI | Chooch 5G and edge computing are inextricably intertwined technologies: each one enables the other. Edge computing depends on fast speeds and low latency in order to transfer large quantities of data in near real time—exactly what 5G is good at providing. For its part, 5G needs applications such as edge computing in order to justify its rollout to wider coverage areas. 5G allows for more and more computing to be done at the edge where the users and devices are physically located, offering unprecedented connectivity and power. The rollout of new technology developments such as edge computing and the 5G wireless network standard has created waves of excitement and speculation across the entire industry. Even better news: 5G and edge computing can act as force multipliers for applications such as computer vision and AI . Edge devices, connected to the vast Internet of Things (IoT) via 5G, can collect, process, and analyze images and videos themselves, without having to send this data to the cloud for processing. 5G and Edge Computing for AI and Computer Vision Mobile industry organization GSMA, for example, predicts that by 2025, 5G connections will account for 20% of connections worldwide and 4% in North America. 5G is predicted to deliver speed improvements that are up to 10 times faster than the current 4G network—so it’s no wonder that users are rushing to adopt this latest innovation. Meanwhile, IT analyst firm Gartner projects that in 2022, half of enterprise data will be generated and processed on the edge, away from traditional data centers and cloud computing. The possibilities of computer vision at the edge, powered by 5G, are nearly limitless. Edge computing and 5G can significantly enhance and unlock the potential of computer vision and AI technologies . Here’s how the process typically works: an edge device captures visual data through a camera or other sensor, and then send s it to the device’s GPU (graphics processing unit). An AI model stored on the device then uses the GPU to rapidly analyze the contents of these images or videos, and can immediately send off the results using 5G technology. There are many different reasons you might prefer to run computer vision models on edge devices, rather than in the cloud: Since you don’t own the servers yourself, running AI models in the cloud is a recurring expense. On the other hand, edge devices allow you to make a single, relatively cheap capital investment that you then own and can operate as you please. As data volumes continue to rise, processing this data locally and independently can help deal with data bloat. Use cases such as self-driving cars depend on near-instantaneous, highly accurate insights, and can’t afford the latency of exchanging data with the cloud. Below are a few more computer vision use cases in which high speed and high accuracy are of the essence: Image recognition models can identify the objects and people in a given image, accurately choosing from hundreds or thousands of categories. For example, edge devices can examine surveillance videos at a construction site to ensure that all workers are wearing PPE (personal protective equipment) . Facial authentication models can determine whether a given individual is authorized to access a restricted area, with very high accuracy, in just a fraction of a second. Event detection models analyze streams of visual data over time to detect a given event, such as smoke and fire detection or fall detection . In all of these use cases and more, edge computing and 5G can help boost speeds and lower latency, delivering immediate value for local users. Case Study: Wind River 5G Edge AI Wind River is a leading technology firm that builds software for embedded systems and edge computing. The company recently partnered with NVIDIA—which builds powerful, compact edge devices like the NVIDIA Jetson—to create a converged technology stack with multiple edge functions, including 5G, intelligent video analytics, and augmented and virtual reality.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/edge-ai-platform-essentials/,"What is edge AI Platform | Chooch Researching AI solutions? Recent technology breakthroughs have made edge AI a go-to method fro implementing computer vision.  Need evidence? Market intelligence firm IDC has predicted that the number of edge AI processor shipments will soar to 1.5 billion in 2023, with a five-year annual growth rate of 65 percent. But what is edge AI exactly, and how do edge AI platforms work? Keep reading for all the answers. What is Edge AI? What are Edge AI Platforms? To answer the question “ What is edge AI? ”, we first need to discuss the key concepts of IoT and edge computing: IoT (Internet of Things) is a massive network of interconnected devices that can communicate and exchange information via the Internet. These days, IoT systems can be found in everything from self-driving cars to the smart toaster in your kitchen that tells you today’s weather. Edge computing is the practice of performing computation closer to the “edge” of the IoT network. Rather than uploading data to a remote server in the cloud for processing, edge computing seeks to do as much of this processing locally as possible, helping to reduce latency and cut costs. Edge AI is therefore the combination of edge computing and artificial intelligence: running AI algorithms on a local hardware device, without having to exchange data with remote servers. One good example of an edge AI system is Apple’s iPhone facial recognition technology , which uses a model of the owner’s face to automatically unlock the device. According to Apple, this model remains on the iPhone at all times, and is never sent to the cloud. By restricting the computation to the user’s device, facial recognition can continue to work even when the phone has no signal. Note that Chooch AI has a facial authentication solution. An edge AI platform is a starter kit for rapidly prototyping and building systems that make use of edge AI. These platforms are generally purchased from third-party companies that have simplified the process of training, testing, deploying, and monitoring AI models. For example, the Chooch Edge AI inference engine can deploy up to 8 models and 8,000 classes on a single edge ai device. What Are the Benefits of Edge AI Platforms? Without an edge AI platform, businesses would have to build everything from scratch—from the hardware itself to the AI algorithms that run on that hardware. Using an edge AI platform lets you get up and running much more quickly, innovating and iterating at the bleeding edge. Edge AI platforms also offer a great deal of stability and dependability. By choosing a solid, reliable third-party provider of edge AI platforms, organizations can outsource concerns such as support and maintenance, focusing on the applications of edge AI rather than the technical details of implementing it. Thanks to their popularity, Edge AI platforms have been used across many different fields and industries, including: Healthcare AI : Edge AI systems have been successfully applied to multiple use cases in healthcare. For example, large DICOM images from MRIs and CT scans can be analyzed on a local machine, rather than incurring the cost of sending data to the cloud. Safety & Security AI: When time is of the essence, running facial recognition and image recognition systems on the edge can make all the difference. Businesses can use edge AI to enforce health and safety regulations in the workplace (e.g. detecting the absence of hard hats on a construction site). Retail AI : Edge AI offers a wide range of possibilities for retail stores: analyzing customer behavioral patterns during the “buyer’s journey,” identifying products that need to be restocked, discovering recent purchasing trends, and much more. The Essential Components of an Edge AI Platform The essential components of a quality edge AI platform include: A camera or sensor used to collect data that will be used as input to the AI algorithm. A GPU (graphics processing unit) used for computation. GPUs are essential for modern AI thanks to their massive parallelism, which makes them dramatically faster than CPUs. An AI model that takes in data and provides computation instructions to the GPU. An analytics dashboard to help users understand the performance of their algorithm over time. Conclusion Edge AI platforms are powerful, robust solutions for bringing AI to a device near you, without having to offload processing to a remote cloud server. As we’ve discussed, edge AI can run in nearly any location, with hundreds of possible use cases to explore.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/loss-prevention-retail-ai-can-make-dramatic-improvements-with-edge-ai/,"Loss Prevention | Retail AI Improvements with Edge AI | Chooch Retail shrinkage is a multi-billion-dollar sore fundamental problem in the retail industry. According to the National Retail Federation, in 2019, the inventory loss due to shoplifting, employee theft, or other errors and fraud reached $61.7 billion in the United States alone. To overcome the issue, retailers have implemented various loss prevention strategies and techniques, from electronic article surveillance, reporting systems, surveillance cameras, and plenty of policies to control the shrink. Yet, they still fall victim to shrinkage, and most of these methods are reactive and tend to be inefficient, cost-wise. The growing volumes of data have led organizations to use available data more effectively by developing systems to report, analyze, and predict shrink accurately. Thus, embracing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and edge AI devices . Why should you consider integrating Edge AI in your Retail activity? Retail shrinkage can drastically impact retailers’ profits and might even put them out of business as the risk gets high for businesses that already have low-profit margins. The higher it gets, the more it can impact organizations’ ability to pay their employees and their business-related expenses, which eventually leads to poor customer service and experience. Loss prevention drives higher profits and more business growth for the retail industry. It is a prime priority for retailers to increase their profits and decrease losses, and Retail AI Solutions are promising in retail loss prevention. These advanced technologies are using data patterns and insights to predict fraudulent activity in forms of shoplifting, internal theft, return fraud, vendor fraud, discount abuse, administrative errors, and so forth. Hence, providing a more proactive approach to reduce retail shrink and loss. Retailers are now shifting to AI-driven solutions that allow an extensive set of opportunities to improve the customer experience as well as enhancing retail security by preserving protection against fraudulent elements of inventory loss and delivering a more reliable shopping experience. Edge AI solutions such as video analytics can run instantly and effectively respond to events and actions occurring at the store. How does Edge AI prevent Retail Loss? There is a significant shift in how Edge AI approaches the loss prevention strategies from reactive to proactive, predictive prevention techniques. The process starts with collecting data from various sources, including security systems (camera, alarm records, etc.), video, payment data, store operation data, point of sales, crime data (local crime statistics), and supply chain data. The data serves as a fundamental feed to leverage techniques such as computer vision, deep learning, behavioral analytics, predictive analytics, pattern recognition, image processing & recognition, machine learning, and correlation. Integrating Edge AI in retail loss prevention offers a set of proactive actions to stop retail loss, increase KPIs to prevent inventory loss, discount abuse, pilferage, shoplifting, theft, and return fraud and reduce shrinkage. Moreover, it shifts the strategy from “Identifying a case” to “Preventing a case.” Retail Edge AI strategies’ examples: Video Analytics Systems Video analytics powered with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms allow retailers to overcome the limitations of traditional video surveillance systems. Artificial intelligence makes video searchable, and actionable enabling its users to proactively investigate the retail loss and pinpoint persons susceptible to committing the retail crimes, as well as offering real-time monitoring and alerts system for suspicious behavior. Smart shelves Smart shelves are using technology to connect to the items they hold to monitor and secure these areas. Smart shelves are configured to provide real-time alerts and trigger calls to action for any abnormal activity detected. Beyond the loss prevention benefits , smart shelves enable retailers to track merchandise in real-time, giving insight into when to restock. RFID tags RFID-enabled smart tags attached to goods communicate with an electronic reader to track products. These devices can be removed at the checkout; if they’re not removed, a security alarm is triggered when the customer tries to exit the store. Point of Sale Systems An automated point of sale, or POS, is ideal for mitigating employee temptations to steal and help implement reliable inventory practices. Traditional systems are managed by employees. Still, failure to scan items is one of the primary ways employee theft occurs. Moreover, by not scanning a product at the checkout, employees are also discrediting inventory visibility. How Can Chooch AI help the retail industry to thrive and stop losses? The future of retail loss prevention is AI-driven. When used accurately, artificial intelligence is able to limit retail loss and manage inventory to overcome shrinkage and impact the bottom line. Are you looking for a reliable partner to strengthen your shrinkage prevention strategy with AI? Chooch offers computer vision and generative AI solutions that empower retailers to optimize in-store operations using real-time image and video data.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-for-retail-theft-prevention/,"Benefits of Using Computer Vision for Retail Theft Prevention Retail industry businesses face the constant threat of theft-related inventory shrinkage, but traditional retail theft prevention methods leave a lot to be desired. In fact, despite the best efforts of retailers, one study indicates that 33% of retail shrinkage is from shoplifting and 33.1% is from employee theft. Now, some retailers are adopting computer vision technology for retail loss prevention . By leveraging AI-enabled cameras and sophisticated computer vision algorithms, retailers are reducing theft-related inventory shrinkage like never before. The challenges of traditional retail theft control strategies It’s important for retailers to use traditional theft control strategies — like human security personnel, security tags, and POS software — but these strategies don’t prevent all instances of theft. In fact, shoplifting results in over $15 billion in U.S. retail losses each year, and this doesn’t account for the enormous costs of employee theft. Despite the use of common theft control strategies, retailers still face the following challenges: Stockrooms and supply rooms are vulnerable: It’s difficult for retailers to track what’s happening in restricted areas like stockrooms, offices, and breakrooms. Dishonest customers, sales employees, and cleaning staff sneak into these unattended areas and steal items without being noticed. Employees are often seasonal: Most retailers perform background security checks on new employees. However, numerous retail employees are temporary and seasonal, making it difficult to know which ones can be trusted not to steal. The dangers of “sweethearting”: Sweethearting happens when a cashier employee adds additional discounts or purposefully doesn’t scan or charge customers for items. Organized crime: Instances of organized shoplifting crimes are growing more common. In these instances, a number of shoplifters will into the store and overwhelm the staff by asking for help with different products. While staff members are engaged, the other shoplifters will steal items without being noticed. Backdoor theft and trash can theft: Employees may steal items by placing them in boxes and taking them out of the backdoor of stores. They could also throw the items they want to steal in the trash and recoup them at a later time. Leveraging computer vision to stop retail theft Computer vision systems for retail theft prevention use a network of AI-enabled cameras, machine learning models, and advanced analytics to detect instances of theft and immediately notify managers to investigate. These solutions operate throughout the day, never get distracted, and monitor all store areas simultaneously. They can run in the cloud for easy scalability or on edge servers for faster processing and maximum data security. Chooch computer vision systems for retail loss prevention can provide the following features and more: Tracking product locations and customer behavior: Computer vision can detect when a customer is about to leave the store without paying for an item. These systems can also trigger alerts to security personnel when a product disappears into a customer’s pocket or bag. Tracking products and boxes in supply rooms: Computer vision can monitor and track the status and locations of boxes and products in supply rooms for better theft prevention and organization. Tracking for organized shoplifting: Visual AI can watch for the signs of an organized shoplifting attack by tracking the number of customers in a store and their behaviors at all times. Detection of known shoplifters and criminals: Visual AI can immediately detect the faces of known shoplifters and criminals as soon as they walk into a retail store. Access control for restricted areas: Facial detection can control access to restricted areas like supply rooms. These systems use facial recognition technology that ensures only authorized employees enter restricted areas. Better checkout security: Computer vision technology can monitor cash registers to ensure that human cashiers charge customers appropriately for all items. This technology can also detect when customers try to steal items at self-checkout stations. Backdoor alerts: AI Vision models can immediately notify managers whenever an employee walks out the backdoor with items or boxes. In addition to these advantages, Chooch AI Vision platform delivers solutions for analyzing customer behavior and demographics and tracking and monitoring shelf space for out-of-stock items.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/meet-korhan-polat-chooch-ml-engineer/,"Meet Korhan Polat, Machine Learning Engineer | Chooch Insights What exactly is machine learning. Broadly speaking, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that leverages data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn.  By feeding large amounts of “training” data, computers can learn to perform almost any given task, with or without human intervention. As machines are fed more data, its prediction accuracy gradually improves. In many ways, the process mimics how humans learn. So how does machine learning impact our lives? When you purchase nearly anything online, machine learning helps guide you to a specific item you’re looking for. Your credit card company uses machine learning to decide if the transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. Social media sites, like Instagram, use machine learning to suggest posts that align with your interests based on your browsing behavior, click patterns, the time you spend on certain posts. Machine learning enables retailers to put ads in front of you based on topics in which you’ve shown interest. Pretty much everything today is powered by some level of machine learning. ML is helping machines do tasks that would normally be done by humans. It is changing the way we live our lives. Machine Learning is one of the most exciting areas of technology for software engineers. Engineers create algorithms that make machine learning possible. It is a highly skilled role, on the forefront of innovation. Meet a Chooch Engineer: Korhan Polat, Machine Learning Engineer Korhan Polat joined Chooch in early 2022 as a machine learning engineer. Prior, he worked as an ML engineer at Anadolu Sigorta, one of the first commercial insurance companies in Turkey. He developed CNN models using PyTorch, for detection and segmentation of car damages from accident photos. He received both a BSc and MSc degrees in electrical and electronics Engineering from Bogazici University in Turkey. He specialized in machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision. Korhan focused his graduate studies on developing vision AI models for classification of brain tumor types from MRIs and unsupervised algorithms that automatically detect human sign language. Korhan, how did you first become interested in machine learning as a profession? I have always been interested in science and technology. I enjoyed math and sciences when I was a student. And I like observing nature. I’m good with numbers. So, the decision to go into machine learning development was easy for me. What do you like most about your job? My job can be described as “teaching machines how to see”. We train AI models that match human perception or often surpass it. However, in some cases, the obvious for the human eye can be very difficult to detect with standard AI models . That’s when we come up with creative solutions as a team. I really like these challenges the most because we’re forced to be creative, and it reinforces how lucky I am to be working with the amazing team of engineers at Chooch. What is there about AI gets you excited? Help mere mortals understand. AI is a field that has evolved rapidly and each month there’s an exciting new AI model that makes everyone even more excited. Moreover, AI research is an endless endeavor to equip machines with human-like reasoning and perception. So, in many ways, AI research teaches us about ourselves, how we derive our own perceptions. This gets me very excited.  I feel like I understand more about human perception as I work with technology to behave more like humans. Where do you think AI is going ultimately? AI has made massive leaps in the last decade. Initially, the discriminative models were revolutionary and took the lead. Lately, we’re witnessing the rise of generative AI models that are getting the most attention right now. I predict that this trend will continue. Also, there will be even more discussions about AI ethics. As AI becomes more widely adopted in our everyday lives, we’ll face many issues with an AI bias and justification. Where do you think AI will have the most compelling impact? What really excites me is AI’s potential to have a positive impact in many areas, but one of the most promising is in healthcare. AI has the potential to help doctors and researchers diagnose diseases more quickly and accurately, develop new treatments, and improve patient outcomes. AI can also help improve access to healthcare in underserved communities and make healthcare more affordable and efficient. Give us a sense of where AI will be ten years from now. Recent trends in AI research include the development of explainable AI, which aims to make AI systems more transparent and understandable to humans. Another trend is the use of unsupervised learning, which allows AI systems to learn from data without being explicitly told what to look for. Finally, there is a growing interest in using AI for social good, such as developing AI systems to help with healthcare or environmental sustainability. What will AI engineers be doing 10 years from now. How will their jobs change? Recent trends in AI research include the development of explainable AI, which aims to make AI systems more transparent and understandable to humans. Unsupervised learning, which allows models to learn from data without being explicitly told what to look for, will surely evolve significantly over the next few years. Finally, there is a growing interest in using AI for social good, such as developing AI systems to help with healthcare , or environmental sustainability. It’s important to start shifting people’s mindsets that AI should not be feared and has real benefits in helping people and the environment. The concept of Artificial Intelligence is certainly not new. Most of us perhaps first became aware of AI with the evolution of spell check in documents and on websites.  But its power to impact daily lives has never been more powerful than it is right now. Often AI makes our work lives and personal lives easier and better without us even being aware that it’s AI making all the things we take for granted possible. The recent news about more modern, more highly evolved chat bots is providing a glimpse into future possibilities. And though no one has a crystal ball, it’s safe to say that AI will ultimately change our lives at least as much as the personal computer has. Even more fascinating is Chooch’s development of an AI solution that will allow people to be interactive with photos, videos and other images to learn more about what is in them. You can ask the images questions, and it will answer you back. This is going to take machine learning to an entirely new dimension. Check it out yourself.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/save-lives-and-lower-costs-ai-ppe-detection-with-computer-vision/,"PPE Detection with Computer Vision AI | Chooch Industrial and manufacturing are two of the most high-risk sectors for workers—but that doesn’t mean you can’t enact safeguards and protections for worker safety while on the job. By using AI to enforce compliance with all applicable environment, health, and safety (EHS) regulations, you’ll be much more likely to avoid accidents and the long-term complications they entail for both workers and their employers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 2.8 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses in 2019 . This includes over 400,000 nonfatal injuries and illnesses in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 15 percent of all workplace accidents in private industry. Meanwhile, according to the National Safety Council, the construction sector experienced the most workplace deaths in 2019, making it arguably the “most dangerous industry.” Far too many injuries in industrial and manufacturing settings are preventable—and many of these are due to improper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) . For industrial and manufacturing occupations, appropriate PPE may include: Hard hats, safety helmets, and other headwear. Safety headgear protects workers from head injuries such as impacts, falling and flying objects, and burns and electrical shocks. Safety glasses and other protective eyewear. Safety glasses protect workers from hazards such as debris and flying particles, heat, light, and radiation. Safety vests and other reflective apparel. Safety vests improve workers’ visibility, alerting other people to their presence and protecting them from accidental impacts from vehicles and heavy machinery. The benefits of enforcing proper industrial PPE usage include: Fewer workplace accidents. Wearing PPE reduces both the frequency and the severity of workplace accidents . Better company culture. Employees feel better working for a company that demonstrates it cares about worker safety. Fewer lost wages and productivity. Injured employees lose out on wages and may have to go on short- or long-term disability, while employers miss out on the employee’s productivity and expertise. Lower insurance premiums. Limiting the number of workplace accidents also helps employers avoid additional insurance costs. Decrease in litigation. Fewer workplace accidents means less stress and expenses associated with personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits. Detecting proper industrial PPE usage with computer vision Despite the benefits of wearing PPE, your managers and employees are only human—so how can you ensure that your workers are actually using PPE properly at all times? The answer lies in AI and computer vision models that can analyze camera footage in a fraction of a second, detecting safety headgear, glasses, and vests (and sending alerts when they’re not detected). The feature-rich, yet user-friendly, Chooch AI platform brings the power of computer vision to the masses. From the Chooch AI dashboard, users can easily oversee and manage their devices and models. Chooch gives users the freedom to train and deploy sophisticated custom AI models that fit their needs and use cases—including detecting whether workers are properly using PPE while on the job site.

Computer vision helps businesses quickly identify and address safety risks, preventing accidents and improving overall employee welfare. Employee safety hazards take many forms, depending on the industry and work environment. These are some of the more common examples where computer vision is used for early hazard detection. Computer vision AI safety applications include: AI can provide significant advantages for manufacturers when used for quality assurance, including: Monitoring hazardous conditions Extreme temperatures, gas leaks, chemical exposures, fire, and smoke can be detected at the earliest signs of leaks or spills to prevent catastrophic environmental incidents, which in the United States alone, happen once every two days costing $477M annually . Detecting emergency response Struck-by incidents, where workers are hit by moving objects or caught-in between accidents where individuals become trapped in machinery or equipment can be identified earlier. Enforcing zones around no-go area sand sending alerts to supervisors when people cross into such zones can provide early warning. Identifying unsafe employee behaviors or practices Slip and fall, firearm, and proper ergonomic detections can be detected using computer vision models installed on cameras and other edge devices. Detecting personal protective equipment (PPE) violations Hardhats, gloves, goggles, safety vests, harnesses are all required safety measures that ensure an organization’s compliance with regulatory agencies, computer vision models can monitor adherance automatically . Predictive maintenance and automated inspection Signs of wear, damage, or tampering with equipment or electrical hazards , such as exposed wiring or overloaded circuits, can be monitored automatically by static cameras or drones running defect detection AI and watching for damage in asset intensive industries. The importance of early hazard detection Identifying and addressing hazards early is crucial for preventing accidents and maintaining a safe work environment. Early detection enables timely intervention, enabling businesses to correct unsafe conditions or practices before they escalate into serious incidents. For example, if an employee is working on an elevated platform and computer vision models detect they’re not wearing a safety harness, an alert can be sent to the employee and their supervisor to address the issue before a serious fall occurs. Traditional methods of hazard detection and limitationsTraditional methods of hazard detection often rely on manual inspections, safety audits, and employee reporting. While these methods can be effective, they have several limitations: Prone to human oversight Inspections and audits can miss critical issues, especially when performed by individuals with limited safety expertise or those experiencing fatigue. Labor intensive Manual safety assessments can be labor-intensive, leaving less time for more productive tasks. Reactive rather than proactive Hazards are normally detected only after they’ve already caused damage or injury, making it difficult to prevent accidents. In contrast, computer vision technology can provide real-time hazard detection and alerts, allowing for immediate corrective action to be taken. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and injuries in the workplace. For example, computer vision can detect when an employee is not wearing the proper personal protective equipment, such as a hard hat or safety glasses, and alert them to put it on before they start working. This can prevent injuries and ensure that employees are always following safety protocols. Real-world examples of computer vision in workplace safety Computer vision technology has already been successfully deployed to enhance safety in a variety of industries. Here are three case studies that demonstrate its effectiveness: Case Study 1: Manufacturing plant A manufacturing facility used computer vision to monitor worker compliance with PPE requirements. The system alerted supervisors in real-time of violations, allowing them to take immediate corrective action. Over time, PPE compliance rates improved, and workplace injuries decreased significantly. Case Study 2: Construction site On a construction site, computer vision cameras were installed to detect workers entering dangerous zones without proper authorization or training. When a breach was detected, a real-time alert was sent to site managers, who could intervene and be proactive in preventing an accident. Case Study 3: Warehouse Using computer vision, a warehouse can monitor forklift operations, identifying instances where drivers performed unsafe maneuvers or failed to wear seat belts. The data gathered was then used to target specific training needs and promote safer operation, reducing the incidence of accidents and property damage. Computer vision and AI safety technology is evolving Computer vision is becoming a powerful tool for detecting employee safety hazards earlier to prevent workplace accidents . By understanding the technology and implementing the right system, businesses can protect their employees and reap long-term benefits. By detecting hazards early and proactively addressing them, businesses create a safer and more productive work culture for their teams.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/how-does-computer-vision-help-detect-unauthorized-personnel/,"How Does Computer Vision Detect Unathorized Personnel? | Chooch Detecting unauthorized personnel is a crucial task for any business that needs to protect the safety of their employees and clients, or that stores valuable assets or data on-premises. Human security guards certainly have their uses, but they aren’t without faults, either: they aren’t available around the clock, they can only be present in a single location, and they’re vulnerable to human error (just like the rest of us). Computer vision can help improve safety and security in the home and workplace by detecting unauthorized individuals. What’s more, computer vision models can run 24/7, with accuracy rates that rival or even surpass your human security personnel. Depending on the situation and use case, you may be able to deploy computer vision in multiple ways to protect the security of your premises , people, and assets: Motion detection: In some cases, you may need to monitor remote or off-limits areas where no one should be present. A simple computer vision model for motion detection can help detect the presence of unauthorized individuals and send alerts to the appropriate authorities. Vehicle identification: If unauthorized personnel are using vehicles to enter restricted areas, you can use computer vision to automatically record the vehicle’s license plate and identify its brand, model, and color. Facial authentication: If only certain individuals should have access to a restricted area, you can use facial authentication to separate authorized from unauthorized personnel. Computer vision models for facial authentication have very high accuracy, run in a fraction of a second, and preserve user privacy by storing only mathematical hashes, rather than the images themselves. Of course, this is all assuming that you have a robust system of security cameras and surveillance equipment that you can use as input to the computer vision model. The good news is that you can now run computer vision models on edge devices that are physically located close to the data source itself, rather than having to upload images and video to the cloud. This enables you to get real-time results, keeping your business premises, people, and assets as secure as possible. Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

https://www.chooch.com/blog/edge-ai-a-gamechanger-for-video-analytics-with-computer-vision/,"Edge AI | Video Analytics with Computer Vision | Chooch Safety and security must be paramount for any business that wants to protect its employees, customers, and assets from potential issues and malicious actors. Yet with more cameras and sensors than ever before, how can organizations lower their risk by quickly and efficiently analyzing the flood of images and videos at their fingertips? The solution comes in the form of edge AI for security video analytics. Below, we’ll discuss computer vision and video analytics work together and why it’s important to perform these analyses on the edge. Computer Vision for Security Video Analytics Computer vision is a subfield of artificial intelligence with the goal of making computers “see” like humans do. The domain of computer vision includes object recognition, facial recognition, event detection, motion tracking, and much more. While computer vision has been widely adopted in dozens of fields and industries, safety and security is one of the top use cases for computer vision. Here at Chooch, we’ve helped many of our clients develop computer vision solutions for their safety and security AI needs. The list of examples includes: OSHA compliance and public safety: Workplaces such as offices, restaurants, and construction sites all have their own set of health and public safety regulations that employees and customers must comply with. For example, computer vision systems can help determine whether workers are wearing protective clothing, such as hard hats or masks. Authentication: Certain restricted areas need to remain accessible to employees while remaining off-limits to the general public. Facial identification systems with liveness detection, supported by computer vision, can help distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate access requests. Remote sensing: Many security cameras and sensors are located in remote areas, making it even more important to detect potential issues and risks. Computer vision can help identify suspicious vehicles, record license plates, detect breaches of a boundary or perimeter, and much more. Object recognition: Using cameras and thermographic sensors for infrared radiation, you can more easily identify noteworthy objects and people within just a fraction of a second, rapidly determining if they pose a security risk. Security video analytics on the edge While computer vision has many possible applications, few of them are as time-sensitive as safety and security. When a computer vision system identifies a potential risk to your organization, you need to take swift and decisive action. This means, of course, that time is of the essence when performing security video analytics. Unfortunately, many computer vision systems are too slow to perform real-time analysis: instead of processing the captured images or video themselves, they upload this data to a more powerful machine in the cloud. Latency issues (waiting for data to be uploaded and analyzed) present a barrier to large-scale adoption of computer vision for safety and security AI . That’s why edge AI is an essential development for the field of security video analytics. Edge computing is a paradigm in which data processing occurs in “edge” devices that are physically located close to the original point of capture, rather than by servers in the cloud. While the field of edge AI is young, it’s growing rapidly as more and more businesses come to realize the benefits of edge computing . For example, Accenture predicts that by 2025, 70 percent of security surveillance cameras will come equipped with real-time monitoring and analytics capabilities, versus just 5 percent in 2018. So how can you leverage the power of the edge for your own safety and security AI needs? Chooch has developed an edge AI platform that can deploy up to 8 models with 8,000 different classes on a single edge device, letting you identify thousands of different types of objects. Powered by NVIDIA Jetson devices, Chooch’s edge AI platform delivers results with greater than 90 percent accuracy within just a fraction of a second.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/presentation-attack-prevention-why-facial-authentication-requires-liveness-detection/,"Why Facial Authentication Requires Liveness Detection | Chooch Facial authentication is a great way to protect virtual content.But like all security features, it too has some dangerous loopholes. With enhanced camera features, 2D or 3D printers, or animation, it is very easy to create fake images that can pass for an actual face. These are what are known as presentation attacks. Preventing presentation attacks is where liveness detection comes in, and now it’s easier than ever to implement with the Facial Recognition API from Chooch . While facial recognition is a good tool for authentication, liveness detection algorithms take care of its vulnerabilities and make sure that these biometric modalities are not compromised in any way. Presentation Attacks Facial recognition , while being a very useful biometric modality, is susceptible to attacks and attempts by fraudsters to destroy its security measures. These attacks are known as presentation attacks or “spoofs”. To get past the biometric security measures and protection systems placed, a fraudster will provide a non-live image, false printed or digital photograph. Videos or masks are also used to impersonate a particular person and assume a fake identity. Presentation attacks are usually of two types and these types depend upon the kind of result the fraudster wishes to cultivate. False Match In a one-to-one biometric comparison, if the fraudster is successful, it is a false match as the fraudster has been able to avoid detection by providing a sample image of the targeted victim. Once this happens, the fraudster will be able to go through the victim’s account, having access to all the applications. False Non-Match If the fraudster creates one account or multiple new accounts of the victim by using an image that will not work in a biometric watch list (especially if the facial features are somehow masked) or duplicate search, it is a false non-match. These false non-matches are very difficult to identify and track as there are too many such accounts. To avoid these attacks, liveness detection is very important. In mobile onboarding, the risk of such attacks or attempts of fraudsters will remain, but this can be prevented if liveness detection algorithms are used. These algorithms can easily select false, non-live images, even if they cannot be used in biometric watch list searches. Liveness detection algorithms can be easily combined with multimodal biometrics, for example, voice recognition, and this strengthens the security measures . If these precautions are not taken, then facial recognition will not be secure from spoofs or presentation attacks. Different Techniques for Liveness Detection The primary job of liveness detection techniques is to provide the maximum security possible and to prevent fraudsters from taking advantage of the existing biometric modalities. Liveness detection techniques are not meant to compromise the user’s experience of using an application, in any way. The different techniques implemented try to minimize interaction with the user so that there are no interruptions that can affect the usage of the application. Active Liveness Detection As the name suggests, this form of liveness detection algorithm requires the user to be active in some. The user might need to wink, smile or shake his or her head. While this prompts a certain level of interaction, the advantage of active liveness detection is that the user will be completely aware during the process. Passive Liveness Detection The technique depends upon algorithms that can detect if any part of the image is false. These algorithms check discrepancies in the image, for example, masks, any kind of distortion, or different textures. Passive liveness detection happens in the background and as it is not even visible to the user, fraudsters find it difficult to get through. Hybrid A hybrid liveness detection technique, while not interacting with the user is not exactly opaque. Therefore, it can still be detected by fraudsters and evaded. How are Liveness Detection Products Certified Against Presentation Attacks? To certify a liveness detection product, its ability to perform is tested. These tests usually involve the use of spoofs to try and get across the biometric security measures. If the liveness detection product is successful in outing these spoofs, and if its performance is according to international standards, then the product is certified. However, these tests might have different settings that might change after production or the spoofed content used might not cover the range of attacks that the product may have to face. There are also some tests that are not of much use in mobile onboarding and the performance of the product in such cases becomes rather irrelevant. Now, if one tries hard enough, it is possible to overcome any security measures, even those of liveness detection. Therefore, before a liveness detection product is certified, it has to go through rigorous evaluation procedures. This will ensure that all possible vulnerabilities are covered. Facial Authentication from Chooch AI has been tested by partners and was found to be spoofproof with liveness detection. If you’d like to do your own testing, please create an account at Chooch and install our API . More about Liveness Detection for presentation attacks is in our API Documentation .

https://www.chooch.com/blog/how-to-turn-unstructured-video-data-into-structured-data-computer-vision/,"How to Turn Unstructured Video Data into Structured Data | Chooch Analyzing big data is crucial for organizations to make smarter data-driven decisions—but not all big data is created equally. It’s important to make the distinction between structured data and unstructured data: Structured data is information that follows a highly organized, predefined schema, making it easy to search through and query. If it can fit inside a relational database or Excel spreadsheet with intersecting rows and columns, it’s structured data. Unstructured data is any information that doesn’t fall into the neat categories of structured data. Examples of unstructured data include text, images, and audio files. In particular, videos are a prime example of unstructured data. Rather than the digital bits and bytes that make up video files, what’s really of interest is high-level information about what the video contains and depicts—from using facial recognition on individuals who appear in the video to detecting dangerous events with fire detection and fall detection. But how can you extract this information in an automated, efficient manner? In other words, how can you turn videos into structured data? How to Create Structured Data from Videos To create structured data from videos, organizations are using sophisticated computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques. Computer vision platforms like Chooch can help anyone build state-of-the-art AI models that analyze videos frame by frame, detecting the people, objects, or events that you’ve trained them to look for. Once you’ve gone through the AI training process, your computer vision model can automatically annotate each frame of the video. AI models can detect the motion of a person or object throughout the scene, as well as detect various actions and events. These annotations, which are saved as structured data, can then be searched and queried to retrieve the most relevant parts of the video. Use Cases of Computer Vision for Video Data Media AI: Computer vision has a wide range of applications in the media and entertainment industries. For example, you can automatically tag the objects in a livestream video, allowing for better targeted advertising. You can also perform facial recognition on the people (e.g., celebrities) in a video, making it easier for people to find who and what they’re looking for. Safety & Security AI : In the field of safety and security, computer vision can help protect public spaces from threats and dangers. Facial recognition models can confirm that an individual is authorized to access the premises, while PPE detection models can make sure that workers are wearing the appropriate clothing and equipment on the job. Geospatial AI: Computer vision models can efficiently analyze drone and satellite images and videos. For example, you can train an AI model to detect wildfires, analyze drought or industrial activity levels, identify different animal species, and much more. Conclusion It’s now easier than ever for your unstructured video data to become structured, thanks to computer vision and AI.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-consulting-5-steps-to-accelerating-computer-vision-adoption/,"5 Steps To Accelerating Computer Vision Adoption | Chooch The reasons for AI project failure are numerous, diverse, and complex. One of the biggest causes, however, is lacking the necessary technical skills—whether from in-house data scientists and machine learning engineers, or from a strong third-party computer vision consulting partner. AI Success With Computer Vision Consulting Despite the enormous potential of state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning technologies, many businesses are still struggling to fulfill their expectations. According to a 2019 report by Pactera Technologies, 85 percent of AI projects ultimately fail . Another report from Dimensional Research found that nearly 8 out of 10 organizations using AI and machine learning say that their projects in these domains have stalled. So, with these statistics in mind, how can you beat the odds and make your own computer vision project a success, without having to get a triple degree in the fields of computer science, computer engineering, and image processing? While it’s never a guarantee, there are a number of actions you can take to dramatically improve the likelihood that users will adopt your computer vision solution . Below, we’ll go over 5 steps to accelerate adoption, based on our years of computer vision consulting expertise. Computer Vision Consulting Step 1: Understand the Potential The first step is to understand the potential that computer vision, AI, and big data can bring to your organization: for example, using computer vision for real time analysis of medical imaging, or for improving the quality of computer graphics. This means a careful and considerate assessment of your existing processes, workflows, and pain points. From there, you can highlight a few key priorities that you plan to focus on. Doing your research and finding a case study for companies in a similar position and industry can help you set your expectations for the project appropriately. According to the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, companies that focus on a few clearly defined themes and priorities during digital transformations are 1.7 times more likely to have the project exceed their expectations . Understand how your chosen initiative will impact your broader business strategy—for example, how it can help you obtain a competitive advantage, or improve your customer experience. Getting all hands on deck and everyone in agreement—from key decision-makers like managers and executives, to the workers in the trenches—is crucial to ensure the project’s success. Computer Vision Consulting Step 2: Plan a Deployment From there, your next step is to plan and execute the roadmap you’ve created for the project. Having the right mix of people and skills is an essential qualification—but unfortunately, one that too many businesses aren’t able to meet. According to research by Boston Consulting Group, only 1 in 4 organizations have access to the talent they need for a successful digital transformation. Committing to visibility and transparency throughout the deployment process will be critical, so that key stakeholders can understand what’s going on at all times. The same McKinsey study also found that companies whose senior leaders make digital transformation a “top priority” are 1.5 times more likely to see results that beat their expectations . Computer Vision Consulting Step 3: Train the System Like children and dogs, computer vision models must be well-trained. The training process can mean the difference between a model that achieves world-class performance, and a model that performs barely better than chance. The sub-steps required in the process of computer vision training include: Sourcing and/or generating a large, diverse dataset. Dividing the original dataset into training, validation, and test sets, each one representative of the larger dataset. Selecting the right deep learning model architecture. Training the system, assessing its performance on the training and validation sets, and adjusting hyper-parameters such as the length of training or the size of the model. This cycle is repeated as necessary until you obtain a satisfactory level of performance. Assessing the system’s final performance on the test set, which thus far the trained model has not seen. Computer Vision Consulting Step 4: Prove the Concept Once you’ve gained some confidence in your trained computer vision system , you can dip your toes in the water by deploying it as a proof of concept (POC). Having a successful POC will ensure you’re on the right track, and can help seal the deal for stakeholders to invest more time, money, and resources in the project. To identify the best choices for a proof of concept, make sure that the domain in which the project will be deployed is relevant to your business strategy as a whole. Try to strike the right balance between a domain that’s adequately complex and relevant, without being too difficult to implement. In addition, your choices of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) should be easily measurable, in order to understand the impact of the project. Computer Vision Consulting Step 5: Generate an ROI Last but certainly not least, your computer vision project needs to generate a return on investment before it can be judged a success. Patience may be key here: many tech executives expect the ROI of their AI projects to take as long as 3 to 5 years . Determining the ROI of computer vision and AI initiatives may include, but is certainly not limited to, cold financial figures. The factors below are just a few to consider when assessing a project’s ROI: Savings in labor costs by automating manual work, and/or the benefits of redirecting human employees to higher-level activities. Cost savings as a result of issues such as bottlenecks, downtime, and maintenance. Providing higher-quality products or a better customer experience. Improved safety and security measures. The benefits of making your organization more flexible, agile, and adaptable. Conclusion By following the 5 steps above, you’ll find that your computer vision project will be a lot easier to implement—and much more likely to succeed. Building your own computer vision solution can be complicated and challenging, which is why you can improve your experience with the help of computer vision consulting experts like Chooch AI.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/human-capital-innovations-podcast-workplace-safety-ai/,"Human Capital Innovations Podcast | Workplace Safety AI | Chooch In this 30-minute podcast, Jonathan Westover of HCI interviews Michael Liou of Chooch AI on workplace safety with computer vision . “If you’re in a workplace, let’s say a warehouse and you want to demonstrate a culture of safety and compliance, and you can count how many times people wearing their hard hats and ensuring people were under safety vests and detecting any smoke or fire.” Listen now or read on. Listen now at HCI Podcast Site for more interviews or read the transcript below. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Welcome to the Human Capital Innovations Podcast. In this HCI podcast episode, I talk with Michael Liou about the latest trends and developments related to AI in the workplace . Michael: Thanks Jonathan. Thanks for having me today. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah, it’s a real pleasure. I’m excited to have this conversation with you. It was fun getting to know you a little bit in the pre-interview as we were just talking and getting to know each other and getting ready for the episode and you have expertise in an area that I know listeners are super tuned into. That is AI; AI in the workplace . And how do we leverage artificial intelligence and deep machine learning to better our workplaces in a variety of ways? So that’ll be the topic that we explore together today, and I’m really excited for the conversation as we get started. I wanted to share Michael’s bio with everybody. Michael Liou is VP of Strategy and Growth at Chooch AI , where he brings a unique blend of strategy, marketing investment, venture capital, and product development skills. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Michael brings an extensive background in venture capital where he has been an active early stage investor, investing in over 100 tech startups, including notable unicorns, such as Robinhood. Michael worked with Citi Private bank, serving ultra high net worth family offices in the Bay Area. Prior to his role at Citi, Michael founded Anvil Capital Advisors. He also spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs as a Managing Director overseeing several business units, both in New York and San Francisco. He holds a Master of Business Administration from NYU Stern School of Business, a Master of Science from Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a Bachelor of Science from Brown University. He recently served on the board of the San Mateo Public Library Foundation. It is a real pleasure to have you Michael, so much expertise, such a rich career, and so many insights. I’m sure you’re going to be able to provide, as we launch into the conversation about artificial intelligence in the workplace. Before we do that, though, is there anything else you would like to share with listeners by way of your personal background or context that would lend itself to this conversation? Michael: Well, thanks Jonathan. I think probably the only thing I would like to share is in my last 10 years of investing, I’ve encountered a lot of great companies and ironically Chooch AI was actually the first company I invested in, actually back in 2016. And it actually was my largest seed check in the last five plus years or so. And so I’ve been quite fortunate to have a front row seat watching this company grow and develop this technology for the first three and a half years or so. And then find it somewhat ironic that in December of 2019, I was asked by the CEO Emrah Gultekin to actually join as Head of Strategy and Growth. And so now I find myself back in technology where I originally started with Bell Labs Research back in the Eighties, now working with some of the best and brightest people at this AI company. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah, that’s really great. And again, you have a really nice complimentary set of experiences in your portfolio, the work that you’ve done over the years throughout your career. And it’s led you to this space now where you get to, as VP of Strategy, you get to lead out with this AI development and integration across organizations. So you’re attuned to all the latest trends, all of the latest developments in the field. And I’m super interested in learning from you today and having a conversation about what those are and how we can best as people managers, as organizational leaders, how we can best leverage the existing technologies to improve the lives of our people to improve the situations that we find ourselves in within the workplace. So why don’t we start by just exploring some of the current trends? What are you seeing in this space and what is, well let’s start there? What are the current AI trends? And then we can start to move into how we see that moving into the workplace. Michael: Sure Jonathan, and thanks again. So when we think about our capabilities as a visual AI company or computer vision, we understand that there are still some bottlenecks out there in terms of the development cycle and what this company has done has really shortened that cycle in terms of generating data sets, in generating these computer vision models, but also putting them out on edge devices. And that means that the compute is actually happening right on the factory floor, right in the warehouse, right in a retail outlet where we can now maintain a really accurate and a high speed of predictions, if you will. And at the same time, maintain that privacy and protection of data, which is really, really important. This is a trend that we’ve seen across all industries. Michael: And then second, if you think about visual AI as a sensor, we can actually enhance human productivity, reduce risk and increase yields by kind of replacing some of the more tedious and manual tasks that humans have to go through every single day and then allowing those humans to potentially perform higher level functions. So imagine an assembly line of bottles are coming through and using machine vision to detect the defects on caps and labels. Well, if we can kind of automate that we can potentially re task people to do more complex tasks versus just looking endlessly at a line of bottles, looking for defects as an example. Or imagine- Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Can I just comment on that as one back, a lifetime ago, back when I was a young and saving up money to go to college. I spent my time on an assembly line in a factory. So I’ve had some of that experience. It’s not a pleasant job. You know, it’s very tedious. It’s mind numbing work. Time moves so slowly. If you want to leverage the potential of people, having them doing those kinds of manual menial tasks day in and day out is not the best way. And so I just wanted to note really quickly cause you made the comment, these technologies… I know people get afraid. They fear AI because they worry about displacement of workers. They worry about automation and the loss of jobs. And certainly there will be tasks and even some jobs and perhaps even some professions that are replaced by machines, but there’s going to be so many more opportunities that are created and new jobs, new tasks, new roles that are going to be created because of the technology, just like we’ve seen at every stage of the industrial revolution. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: And as we talk about being in this being industrial revolution 4.0., yeah, we’re going to have certain jobs that go away. We’re going to have certain tasks that go away, but to the betterment of the workers, ultimately as we re-skill and up-skill and do more complex things that are more interesting and engaging and ultimately more fulfilling. We’ll be able to thrive more, I think, as people in the workplace. So that’s just a quick comment I wanted to make, because I really do think that that’s an important benefit to everything that we see coming down the pipeline with AI, machine learning, automation and such. Michael: Absolutely Jonathan. And as a matter of fact, one of the other advantages that, computer vision can provide is that degree of consistency and uptime. So imagine a warehouse scenario or an airport scenario where we’re trying to look for people who are wearing the appropriate safety gear or looking for people of interest. The human being, when they’re focusing on these tasks, can be efficient up to a certain point. And then thereafter, fatigue can potentially set in. You might be texting your friend. You might have to eat lunch or go to the bathroom, whereas a camera outfitted with the appropriate, accurate computer vision models can tirelessly continue to perform those menial tasks and also aggregate that data too. And that data can be stored and analyzed for future analysis. Michael: So if you’re in a workplace, let’s say a warehouse and you want to demonstrate a culture of safety and compliance, and you can count how many times people wearing their hard hats and ensuring people were under safety vests and detecting any smoke or fire. When it’s very, very early stage, you’re going to have fewer accidents. You can decrease the risk of workers in a workplace . And ultimately, you’re going to be able to decrease frequency and severity. And if that can be demonstrated to an insurance company, there is a significant chance that you can reduce the amount of premium that you paid to the insurance company of workers’ compensation. So there isn’t a real ROI here, not to mention the cultural and safety indemnity and long-term, and short-term disability benefits that come along with that reduction of risk. Michael: Yeah, absolutely. In that, the risk management component is one that I have to admit, as people talk about the benefits of AI, that’s not the first thing that most people start to talk about. And it’s not the first thing I usually think about. But as an HR professional in the HR and people management space, safety and compliance is a big deal. And if you want to make sure, the premium issue and the cost savings component alone is worth doing this. But also, just the human cost of pain and suffering due to injuries or heaven forbid even death in the workplace; if we can eliminate more of those types of incidences. That’s to everyone’s benefit, that’s the organization’s bottom line benefit, but it’s also to the team and the individuals’ benefit because they’re taken care of and safety and compliance is a really tough nut to crack. Michael: I think anyone who works in that space knows how difficult it is and best intentions don’t mean much of anything. If you don’t actually have the systems and processes in place to make sure that your people are kept safe and they are complying with the rules and the regulations. And so having the AI to assist you like you’re describing will be a really huge benefit to organizations. Not just to the bottom line, but like you said, to the culture of safety, to the culture of, not just physical safety. We want psychological safety in the workplace . We don’t want people fearing how they’re going to be taken care of at work. We want to take that off the table. We want that to just be a given that people are safe, people will be taken care of. Michael: Absolutely. There’s the financial repercussions. And then as you mentioned, there’s the cultural repercussions, culturally meaning of reputational risk, a compliance risk, sanctioned risk, and of course, litigation risk as well too might. So why open yourself up as some of these near misses or behaviors can be tracked and potentially buttoned down so that you reduce the risk overall. It could be something as simple as detecting puddles or slippery surfaces before someone falls down, to sending an alert to someone who is on a ladder who should be wearing a safety harness before they ascend a ladder? Everyone likes to save time, but, you should also make sure that people aren’t texting while they’re driving a forklift. Or texting when they’re near a earth mover, moving around on a commercial work site. So there are many applications of computer vision that seems somewhat innocuous, but when you add them all up, actually can lead to a greater culture and environment of safety and lower risk. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah. I love it. And I just heard, I’m sure you have too. I’ve heard so many horror stories of people who are just, again, they’re cutting corners, not because they’re lazy, usually. They’re cutting corners because they’re trying to be efficient. They’re trying to move more quickly. They’re trying to produce for company. And a lot of times there is performance pressure being put on them. And so, they have to harness up and they’re like, “Ah, it’s just a really quick thing. I can just jump on real quick and I’ll be up and down, you know? And if I have to harness up, it’s going to take more time.” And so they just want to do it quickly. That kind of thing, those types of incidences happen all the time. And they’re so avoidable, not just because you have someone monitoring and people know that they’re monitored, and then they get the alerts like you’re describing. But it holds management accountable too, to not put undue pressure on time and efficiency when it is sacrificing safety. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Because oftentimes when I’ve gone into organizations and I’ve seen a poor safety record, it’s usually a dual problem. There’s some training issues usually that have to be put in place. There’s some processes that need to be fine tuned to make sure that people know what they need to be doing, how and when and all of that. But usually there’s also a cultural component due to the pressure being put on the workers by administrators that is unsustainable. And it leads to people cutting corners and those safety corners in the long run are going to be very much more detrimental to the success of the organization than if they take a couple extra minutes to practice those safety procedures. So as you’re describing, this visual component, it’s an extra layer, it’s an extra mechanism to ensure that you’re holding everyone accountable, that you’re making sure that everyone is taking safety very, very seriously. So what are some of the other trends that you see out there right now, and that your organization’s working with in relation to AI in the workplace? Commercial Break: I’m excited to announce the publication of my new book from HCI Press, “The Alchemy of Truly Remarkable Leadership: Ordinary, Everyday Actions That Produce Extraordinary Results”. Consider how the nature of work has shifted over the past 50 years with increased globalization, rapid technological advancement, and the shift in economic composition. The average job of today looks very different than the average job of 50 years ago. What will the jobs and organizations of tomorrow look like? Moreover, what does this all mean for organizational leaders? What are the core competencies and capabilities of organizations and their leadership that are prepared for continued disruption and geopolitical and socioeconomic shifts? Regardless of what the future holds, increasingly leaders need to be socially minded, data-driven, decisive ,champions of talent and disruptors of the traditional notions of leadership, teams, organizations, and work. “The Alchemy of Truly Remarkable Leadership” will help you to explore your own leadership competencies and capabilities and consider ways to apply and implement them into your workplace and personal life. Michael: I would say that safety and security in the workplace is certainly paramount because every industry has a warehouse or every industry has a logistics staging center. And if you think about the trends in retail with omnichannel being here to stay, you’ve got more pressure to build these logistics centers and these fulfillment warehouses. So there is this kind of breakneck speed to build all this infrastructure, which means more and more people will be entering to the workforce that will be exposed to these dangers. And so, as a result, in this kind of hurry to be competitive, there is this risk again that people may cut corners. There is an OSHA requirement that if you have an injury or accident in the workplace, this needs to be reported in 24 hours. And I’m pretty sure that’s not being complied to. Michael: And you might be able to get away with cutting corners every single day, but all you need is that literally 1% chance to come to fruition where there’s a death or dismemberment, and it just ruins everything. Ruins morale, increases risk. There’s a ton of paperwork needs to be fulfilled. And so again, ensuring that there’s this compliance and culture of safety, I think is paramount. And this goes for the construction industry as well, where you could argue they’re even more dangerous jobs like roofing as an example, which have some of the higher risks out there, or jobs in slaughterhouses, which are also a very, very risky as well. But we’ve also focused on a public safety and so there’s a little bit of overlap. So in addition to detecting PPE equipment in the industrial workplace, we’ve also developed models for things like smoke detection, fire detection, fall detection in public areas, nursing homes, hospitals, and we’ve also developed weapons detection to handgun, knife and rifle. Michael: And if one’s able to detect these anomalies earlier, than potentially emergency response can be activated more quickly and render aid or help all a bit more expeditiously onsite. So imagine a mall where you typically have video cameras everywhere, and three people sitting in the security room, looking for events that don’t happen. It might be better if they could actually be walking the premises and having an AI to say, “Hey, there’s a fight breaking out in front of Macy’s” or “Hey, there’s a slippery surface in front of JC Penny’s. Someone better mop that up before they crack their skull. And then sue the mall operator as an example.” So I think public safety is also another area. And this blends into the overall arching theme of smart city. Can we enable computer vision to help our cities safer? Ensuring that people are not driving and using mobile phones at the same time, making sure they have their seat belts on, detecting any areas where there might be a violence breaking out, or there may be a fire or smoke breaking out. Michael: The current state of technology for detecting smoke and fire indoors is thermal sensors and smoke detectors. Well, in 30 foot ceiling warehouses, those flames need to be pretty big before they start setting those things off. What would happen if we could actually use computer vision to detect smoke and fire at a much earlier stage? You might be able to prevent a full-blown conflagration and a three alarm response from the fire department. You might be able to put it out on your own or elicit a smaller response and be a little bit more preventive. Now I must caution that these technologies aren’t regulated. Obviously smoke detectors and heat sensors are regulated and do provide a very good level of safety. But we do think that computer vision, our AI models, could be complimentary into these existing technologies and again, potentially save lives and damage and speed response or initiate sponsor faster. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah, yeah. And that speed response, I think, is one of the critical components whenever you’re dealing with these sorts of issues. And you’ve raised a couple of times now, not just the traditional OSHA safety type concerns, but also things like weapon detection. I don’t want to get into a whole political conversation on guns rights and gun issues. But the reality is that we live in a current climate and context where gun violence is fairly prevalent. And so if you can have this type of technology utilized in order to recognize when there’s a threat and have quick rapid response to that threat, think about the potential number of lives that can be saved. And some of these incidences, we hear about there’s one, what was it just a couple of weeks ago in Colorado, we had another incident. And so if you can utilize this type of technology, I think it’s a really great opportunity to provide that level of safety and security for people. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: And you also brought up the regulatory piece and how that currently isn’t in place for this technology. My next kind of thought feeds off of that comment. And that is, what are some of the ethical considerations that we need to really be thoughtful about and careful about as we’re integrating more of these AI technologies into the workplace, or really into our communities at large? Because certainly, in terms of the surveillance piece and some of these other elements, there’s certainly a potential for concern. So what is your organization doing to help with that kind of ethical AI drive to make sure that we’re doing things properly and what should organizations and leaders listening to this podcast today? What should they be considering as they consider those ethical components to utilizing your technology and other similar technologies? Michael: Yeah, this is a really, really important topic, Jonathan, when it comes to computer vision. And if you think about the models that are out there, there are two main concerns that you can now break this into. One is obviously privacy THe second is bias and bias in models comes from a bias in data that helps train those models. So that’s really, really important. And when people talk about bias, they primarily focus more on the official recognition aspects. So it’s known that a lot of, some of the public models that are out there, I have biases towards people of color, people who are Asian of descent as an example. And so people have to kind of go back to the drawing board, right? If they’re going to use facial, they need to use it in a much less biased manner. Michael: So that’s one concern. Second is the privacy issue in the sense that most stores have camera monitoring systems already. And those videos are actually being digitally stored already. And the difference is that typically these videos are monitored by a staff of humans, either onsite or offsite for any security. And so they’re kind of watching you anyway, right? What we need to be careful about with computer vision is that we need to use it for the basis of good – for the public good, if you will. And so when people say, “Are you recording my face? Can you recognize who we are?”, it depends upon what computer models are actually loaded into the system. So, as an example, if I just have fire and smoke detection and fall detection loaded into our system, then that’s all it’s going to detect. Michael: So it’s not going to take human faces. It’s not going to do demographics. It’s not going to determine racial or ethnicity amongst the population. And so there is a degree of control that management has in terms of when they implement certain particular models. You could implement weapons detection, fire and smoke for just a public safety aspect. And again, there’s no facial recognition happening. Those cameras, there’s no database to cross reference people. So I think it’s important to kind of clarify what can and cannot be done. Michael: There are companies who do focus on facial, and there are companies who have extensive databases of people’s identities matched up with faces. I can tell you at Chooch AI , we do not do that. We do have private enterprise inquiries where people who want to use facial for things like airplane check-in, airplane boarding, a cruise line check-in, a hospitality access control in the public and private sector, into restricted areas. And I think that’s fine, right? As a matter of fact, when you use facial for access control, you kind of eliminate the risk for any type of potential compromise, like giving someone your passcode or giving someone your key card. And actually made things a little bit safer. But again, I think it’s important to understand that the computer vision models will do and be trained specifically for its particular task. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. I think those are all important points and we really just scratched the surface of the conversation in relation to the ethical components. Really, we scratched the surface on all the AI potential within the workplace, but those ethical components, we can’t forget about that. And sometimes we get super excited about the engineering piece of the technology and the capabilities. But if we sever the continued development of the technology from the ethical conversations, then that’s where we can take the humanity out of the workplace potentially and find ourselves in other difficult situations. I appreciate that lens that you added to our conversation here today. And I would encourage listeners, have these meaningful conversations with your C-suite leadership and leadership down the organization and talk about how the types of applications that Michael has been describing, how it could be utilized while keeping in mind that those ethical components in the protections for your people and for the customers. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Michael, it has been a real pleasure talking with you today. I do want to be mindful of your time. I recognize you’re very busy and we’ll need to move on to the rest of your day. But before we close, I wanted to give you a chance to reach out or to share with listeners how they can get connected with you, find out more about your organization and how you can benefit them. And then give us the final word on the topic for today. Michael: Yeah, sure Jonathan. More information can be found on our website at chooch.ai. It’s a fairly rich website with a number of different links to videos, capabilities, verticals, as well as demo links to our best capabilities. We are very horizontal on Jonathan. So we have applications in many different industries, ranging from oil and gas to healthcare, media, retail, industrial warehouses, and even geospatial capabilities. So I think the team here has worked very, very hard in creating a very powerful and flexible platform. And we’re looking to help other organizations. I hate to overuse this word, use computer vision for digital transformation, reduce risk, potentially enhance safety, increase yield, decrease costs, and just make their workplace more efficient. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Wonderful. Thank you, Michael. It has been a real pleasure talking with you. I encourage listeners to reach out, get connected with Michael, find out more about what he and his company can do for you. And as always, I hope everyone can stay healthy and safe, that you can find meaning and purpose at work each and every day. And I hope you all have a great week.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-for-inspection-and-monitoring-of-industrial-infrastructure/,"Computer Vision for Infrastructure Inspection & Monitoring | Chooch Large-scale industrial operations manage infrastructure networks spanning hundreds of miles. An energy company, for example, needs to maintain vast networks of electrical wires, distribution poles, transmission towers, electrical substations, and other critical assets. Because these assets are often located in remote and dangerous locations, inspecting them for maintenance issues demands high-risk expeditions, skilled labor, and an enormous amount of time and financial resources. Today, computer vision technology empowers industrial companies to achieve safer, more accurate, and more cost-effective inspections of key infrastructure components. Whether the computer vision inspection strategy involves IoT-connected smart cameras installed in remote locations, drones collecting visual data by air – or satellite imagery – a well-trained visual AI system can detect maintenance problems, environmental hazards, and safety concerns with higher degrees of accuracy than traditional methods of infrastructure inspection. Get a demo of AI for infrastructure inspection with Industrial AI . Traditional Methods of Infrastructure Inspection The inspection and maintenance of critical infrastructure components is a necessary part of nearly every large-scale industry. Some common infrastructure types requiring inspections include: Power lines Utility infrastructure Construction sites Cell towers Coastal shoreline erosion Bridges Roads and interstates Hydroelectric dams Wind turbines Solar farms Industrial agriculture Wastewater and effluent Each of the above use cases has developed its own standards and procedures for infrastructure inspection and maintenance – including inspections for compliance with environmental statutes. Traditional methods for performing these inspections may include the use of: Human visual inspectors Photogrammetry Orthomosaics 3D models Geospatial information services Aerial inspections by helicopter Drone-based aerial photography Satellite imagery LiDAR Ultrasound Liquid penetration inspection (LPI) Radiography Infrared camera footage Surveillance cameras installed at various inspection sites Aside from using advanced technology, trained and experienced professionals are an integral part of most inspection processes. These inspectors frequently endure dangerous conditions to perform in-person evaluations using the human eye alone with no special instrumentation. Often traveling to remote areas by helicopter, working out of bucket trucks – or climbing up towers, wind turbines, bridges, and electrical distribution poles – human inspectors need to evaluate the condition of key assets to answer a host of questions. Infrastructure inspectors may need to consider questions such as: Is it rusty? Is it structurally sound? Are trees growing over a transformer box? Are guy-wires intact? Are key actions happening on schedule? Is wastewater flowing properly through drain pipes? Is it overheating? Is it the wrong color? Are power lines broken or hanging too low? Is it leaking? The Challenges of Traditional Infrastructure Inspections Large-scale industrial operations spend millions of dollars each year to conduct visual inspections that rely on human eyes and human understanding without any special equipment. Until the recent introduction of computer vision technology , the use of human inspectors for these visual evaluations was a necessity. However, the following challenges continue to plague any inspection activities that rely on human eyes: Slow and laborious: Getting human workers on-site to perform inspections at thousands of sites across hundreds of miles of distance is difficult, costly, and time-consuming – resulting in infrequent inspections and detection delays. For example, a wastewater treatment facility could be dumping contaminated effluent into a river for days – even months – before a human inspector detects the problem. Similarly, the infrequent inspection of hydroelectric facilities, cell towers, wind turbines, and other infrastructure components means that an inexpensive problem could grow into a devastating catastrophe. Risky and dangerous: The process of sending human workers to remote sites to climb cell towers and key pieces of infrastructure is fraught with dangers. For example, workers climbing cell towers face the risk of electrocution, inclement weather (excessive wind, rain, lightning, hail, and snow), objects falling at high speeds, and protective equipment failures. The remoteness of inspection sites – combined with dangerous inspection tasks and safety training failures – elevates the chances and severity of injuries. Error-prone: Whether they are performing inspections on-site, or remotely while viewing visual data collected by cameras, drones, and other detection equipment, inspectors can only achieve certain levels of accuracy due to the inherent limitations of their human faculties. Human inspectors are commonly overworked, lacking adequate rest, bored, inadequately trained, or without sufficient experience and expertise. These challenges result in errors, mistakes, and inconsistent inspection results. Expensive: Hiring, training, and employing skilled human inspectors is costly – so is transporting inspectors to and from remote inspection sites. Utility companies pay as much as $1,000 per mile for aerial inspections by helicopter. Insurance costs related to these often dangerous inspection activities are another significant expense. Consider the simple inspection task of monitoring for tree overgrowth around power lines. It’s not uncommon for tree branches to break through power lines, destabilize distribution poles, and short-circuit transformers. Early detection and trimming of trees is essential to prevent blackouts, fires, and electrocution hazards . However, it’s costly, time-consuming – and virtually impossible – to detect all instances of tree overgrowth. Invariably, an undetected branch could grow in such a way that leads to an expensive or catastrophic problem. Another simple yet problematic inspection task relates to monitoring wastewater effluent for signs of particles, discharges, and discoloration. Human inspectors need to continually check discharge pipes to ensure that wastewater is running clean and on schedule. If not, the problem could represent a costly violation of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria or Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) standards. However, due to the limited number of human inspectors – and logistical challenges associated with constant monitoring – it’s not uncommon for factories, plants, and wastewater treatment facilities to unknowingly discharge untreated water directly into the ocean – sometimes for weeks or months before they detect it. Leveraging Computer Vision for Better Infrastructure Inspections Computer vision technology provides a cost-effective solution for conducting accurate and timely inspections of industrial infrastructure assets. In addition to achieving more accurate and consistent results than human-led inspections, visual AI for infrastructure inspection is dramatically safer and more affordable. Computer vision strategies for infrastructure inspection leverage the following features: High-definition IoT-connected cameras – including infrared cameras – mounted in remote locations that observe site conditions. Deployment of drones for aerial footage, visual measurements, and automatic identification of potential problems. High-resolution satellite topography imagery to show the current condition and status of assets on the ground. Edge servers running sophisticated AI models that analyze and interpret visual data, identify maintenance issues, detect environmental hazards , and spot instances of fire and overheating. Instant alerts, reports, and metrics sent to decision-makers for immediate action on potential problems. With Chooch, companies that manage large infrastructure networks can rapidly train computer vision models to detect all types of visually perceivable problems and maintenance concerns. Through the use of drones, on-site surveillance cameras, and satellite imagery, Chooch AI systems can monitor critical infrastructure assets without the time, risk, and cost of transporting human inspectors to remote locations – and do so faster and more accurately. Chooch offers industrial companies immediate access to a wide library of pre-built visual AI models for the most common inspection use cases. For more unique scenarios, operators can add layers of training to existing models – or train entirely new models – depending on the inspection needs. Armed with these tools and the Chooch AI platform , customers can develop visual AI models that instantly detect the following concerns: Tree overgrowth Rusty, damaged, or defective structures Overheating, smoke, flares, and fire Leaks in pipes Wastewater effluent and discharges Retention pond and drainage problems Low-hanging or broken power lines Virtually any other visually detectable inspection issue At the end of the day, the ROI benefit of computer vision for industrial inspections is clear. Whether it’s a large-scale industrial operation, utility company, or governmental organization, computer vision technology empowers faster and more accurate detection of maintenance and environmental concerns – orders of magnitude more affordable than relying on human inspectors alone. Even better, Chooch AI can design and deploy a custom visual AI inspection strategy in only 6 to 9 days. Get a demo of AI for infrastructure inspection with Industrial AI .

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-engineer-skills-and-jobs/,"Computer Vision Engineer Skills And Jobs | Chooch Computer vision engineers work in the domain of computer vision : the subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence that seeks to make computers “see” images and videos at a high level, in the same way that humans can. More specifically, those with computer vision engineering skills can uses the AI tools to make it their job to solve real-world problems. The fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence , along with subfields such as computer vision, have never been a hotter employment prospect. According to Indeed, computer vision engineers in the U.S. have one of the highest salaries in the technology industry, with an average base pay over $158,000 . But what do computer vision engineers do, exactly, and what skills to you need to be a computer vision engineer? What does a computer vision engineer do? The job roles and responsibilities of computer vision engineers may include: Designing and developing systems and software that use computer vision. Creating and/or using computer vision libraries and frameworks. Sourcing and preparing computer vision training datasets. Experimenting with computer vision models by training and testing models and analyzing the results. Reading computer vision research papers to learn about new developments in the field. The computer vision engineer skills you need to have What skills do computer vision engineers need in order to carry out these job roles and responsibilities? Most employers prefer computer vision engineers to have education (i.e. a bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD) in a subject such as computer science, engineering, or mathematics. This education should likely have included coursework on topics such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, image processing, signal processing, data science, and software development. Mathematics courses on linear algebra, calculus, and probability and statistics are also highly useful for computer vision engineers. In addition to this theoretical background, computer vision engineers also need practical skills to implement real-world solutions. Computer vision engineers should be able to train and optimize AI models and deploy them in production scenarios. Familiarity with libraries and frameworks for computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and data science—e.g. OpenCV, sklearn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow—is highly valuable. The Python programming language currently dominates the field, with 57 percent of machine learning developers and data scientists using Python. In addition, knowing other languages is also helpful: OpenCV is primarily written in C++ (although it has interfaces for Python and Java), and MATLAB is very popular for image processing. The future of computer vision engineer jobs Want to become a computer vision engineer? Many computer vision engineers take the traditional route to their choice of career: getting a degree in a STEM subject such as computer science or mathematics, often doing relevant internships or performing relevant research along the way. Even without a formal education in computer vision and computer science, however, becoming a computer vision engineer isn’t out of reach. Many companies looking to hire computer vision engineers are open to non-traditional candidates who can replace education with experience (e.g. by showing previous work on computer vision projects or open-source software).

https://www.chooch.com/blog/6-applications-of-machine-learning-for-computer-vision/,"Applications of Machine Learning for Computer Vision | Chooch AI is nothing new to anyone reading this computer vision blog . Siri, Alexa, and web chatbots have made AI commonplace. Yet, computer vision gives AI a pair of eyes that can be taught with machine learning. What is machine learning? Machine learning is the application of statistical models and algorithms to perform tasks without the need to introduce explicit instructions. It relies on inference and pattern recognition using existing data sets. It requires minimal assistance from programmers in making decisions. What is computer vision? Computer vision refers to the ability of a machine to understand images and videos. It mimics the capability of human vision by acquiring, processing, and analyzing real-world data and synthesizing them into useful information. It uses a camera to capture images and videos to analyze, which can then be purposed for object recognition, motion estimation, and video tracking. 6 applications of computer vision Machine learning and computer vision are often used together to effectively acquire, analyze, and interpret captured visual data. Here are six applications of these technologies to help illustrate some of the benefits Chooch is seeing in the marketplace. 1. Automotive Self-driving cars are slowly making their way into the market, with more companies looking for innovative ways to bring more electric vehicles onto the road. Computer vision technology helps these self-driving vehicles ‘see’ the environment while machine learning algorithms create the “brains” that help that computer vision interpret the objects around the car. Self-driving cars are equipped with multiple cameras to provide a complete 360-degree view of the environment within a range of hundreds of meters. Tesla cars, for instance, uses up to 8 surround cameras to achieve this feat . Twelve ultrasonic sensors for detecting hard and soft objects on the road and a forward-facing radar that enables the detection of other vehicles even through rain or fog are also installed to complement the cameras. With large amounts of data being fed into the vehicle, a simple computer won’t be enough to handle the influx of information. This is why all self-driving cars have an onboard computer with computer vision features created through machine learning. The cameras and sensors are tasked to both detect and classify objects in the environment – like pedestrians. The location, density, shape, and depth of the objects have to be considered instantaneously to enable the rest of the driving system to make appropriate decisions. All these computations are only possible through the integration of machine learning and deep neural networks which results in features like pedestrian detection. Fig. 1. A Tesla car’s vision (Source: Tesla ) Road conditions, traffic situations, and other environmental factors don’t remain the same every time you get in the car. Having a computer simply memorize what it sees won’t be useful when changes are suddenly introduced into the environment. Machine learning helps the computer “understand” what it sees, allowing the system to quickly adapt to whichever environment it’s brought into. That’s artificial intelligence. 2. Banking Banks are also using computer vision and machine learning to quickly authenticate documents such as IDs, checks, and passports. A customer can just take a photo of themselves or their ID using a mobile device to authorize transactions, but liveliness detection and anti-spoofing can be acquired through machine learning and then detected by computer vision. Chooch features facial authentication for banking. Some banks are starting to implement online deposit of checks through a mobile phone app. Using computer vision and machine learning, the system is designed to read the important details on an uploaded photo of a check for deposit. The algorithm can automatically correct distortions, skews, warps, and poor lighting conditions present on the image. There’s no need to go to the bank to deposit checks or process other transactions that used to be done over-the-counter. The Mercantile Bank of Michigan which adopted this system was able to realize a 20% increase in its online bank users . 3. Industrial facilities management The industrial sector has critical infrastructure which must always be monitored, secured, and regulated to avoid any kind of loss or damage. In the oil industry, for example, remote oil wells must be monitored regularly to ensure smooth operation. However, with sites deployed in several regions, it would be very costly to do site visits every so often. Using machine learning and computer vision, oil companies can monitor sites 24/7 without having to deploy employees. The system can be programmed to read tank levels, spot leaks, and ensure the security of the facilities. Alerts are raised whenever an anomaly is detected in any of the sites, enabling a quick response from the management team. The way computer vision is used in the scenario above can be adopted by chemical factories, refineries, and even nuclear power plants. Sensors and camera feed must all be connected and handled by a powerful AI fully capable of utilizing computer vision and machine learning to detect pedestrians and vehicles approaching or entering the facilities. 4. Healthcare There are several applications for machine learning and computer vision in healthcare . Accurately classifying illnesses is becoming better now, thanks to computer vision technology. With machine learning training, AI can “learn” what diseases look like in medical imaging. It is now even possible to diagnose patients using a mobile phone, eliminating the need to line up in hospitals for an appointment. Gauss Surgical , a medical technology company, is using cloud-based computer vision technology and machine learning algorithms to estimate blood loss during surgical operations. Using an iPad-based app and a camera, the captured images of suction canisters and surgical sponges are analyzed to predict the possibility of hemorrhage. They’re found to be more accurate than the visual estimates of doctors during medical procedures. Chooch is developing several initiatives in the computer vision for healthcare space. For more information please contact us about use cases. 5. Retail Chooch is powering identification and recommendation engines for several high traffic sites, and we are also working on inventory systems, but computer vision is also being used in the physical world by other companies. Amazon, notably, recently opened their Amazon Go store where shoppers can just pick up any item and leave the store without having to go through a checkout counter. Automatic electronic payments are made possible by equipping the Go store with cameras with computer vision capabilities. Fig. 2. An Amazon Go branch (Source: CNET ) Cameras are placed on aisles and shelves to monitor when a customer picks up or returns an item. Each customer is assigned a virtual basket that gets filled according to the item they take from the shelves. When done, customers can freely walk out of the store and the cost will be charged to their Amazon account. Cashiers have been eliminated through this program, a personal cost savings, allowing for a faster and more convenient checkout process. Security won’t be an issue also since the system can track multiple individuals simultaneously without using facial recognition. Amazon has also applied for a patent for a virtual mirror. This technology makes use of computer vision to project the image of the individual looking at the mirror. Various superimpositions like clothes and accessories can then be placed over the reflection, allowing the shopper to try different items without needing to physically put them on. 6. Security The security sector benefits greatly the most from the perfect unison between machine learning and computer vision. For instance, airports, stadiums, and even streets are installed with facial recognition systems to identify terrorists and wanted criminals. Cameras can quickly match an individual’s face against a database and prompt authorities on the presence of known threats in the facility. Offices are also installing CCTV cameras to identify who enters and exits the premises. Some rooms accessible only to authorized personnel can be set with an automatic alarm when an unrecognized individual is identified by the camera linked to a computer vision system. Retail security has also been quick to take up computer vision and machine learning to improve the safety of business assets. Retailers have been using computer technology to reduce theft and losses at their branches by installing intelligent cameras in the vicinity. Checkout can also be monitored. Using computer vision technology , cameras can be placed over checkout counters to monitor product scans. Any item that crosses the scanner without being tagged as a sale is labeled by the software as a loss. The report is then sent to the management to handle the issue and prevent similar incidents from happening. Computer vision possibilities Computer vision has a wide variety of applications in different industries. From banking and automotive to sports and security, the power of cameras combined with machine learning poses endless possibilities for improving business performance. Chooch offers different forms of AI Vision technology that can improve the productivity and efficiency of your marketing and security efforts.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/industrial-computer-vision-inspection-better-monitoring-of-critical-infrastructure/,"Industrial Computer Vision Inspection for Monitoring Infrastructure | Chooch Large-scale industrial companies rely heavily on experienced human employees to routinely inspect vast infrastructure networks. However, these inspection activities are expensive, time-consuming, dangerous, and highly prone to mistakes and errors. Now, industrial companies are adopting computer vision to radically improve the speed, safety, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of infrastructure inspection. Large-scale industrial operations manage infrastructure networks spanning hundreds of miles. An energy company, for example, needs to maintain vast networks of electrical wires, distribution poles, transmission towers, electrical substations, and other critical assets. Because these assets are often located in remote and dangerous locations, inspecting them for maintenance issues demands high-risk expeditions, skilled labor, and an enormous amount of time and financial resources. Today, computer vision technology empowers industrial companies to achieve safer, more accurate, and more cost-effective inspections of key infrastructure components. Traditional Methods of Infrastructure Inspection The inspection and maintenance of critical infrastructure components is a necessary part of nearly every large-scale industry. Some common infrastructure types requiring inspections include: Power lines Utility infrastructure Construction sites Cell towers Roads and interstates Wind turbines Industrial agriculture Wastewater and effluent Aside from using advanced technology, trained and experienced professionals are an integral part of most inspection processes. These inspectors frequently endure dangerous conditions to perform in-person evaluations using the human eye alone with no special instrumentation. Often traveling to remote areas by helicopter, working out of bucket trucks – or climbing up towers, wind turbines, bridges, and electrical distribution poles – human inspectors need to evaluate the condition of key assets to answer a host of questions like: Is it rusty? Is it structurally sound? Are trees growing over a transformer box? Are guy-wires intact? Is it leaking? And a great deal more Leveraging Computer Vision for Better Infrastructure Inspections Computer vision technology provides a cost-effective solution for conducting accurate and timely inspections of industrial infrastructure assets. In addition to achieving more accurate and consistent results than human-led inspections, visual AI for infrastructure inspection is dramatically safer and more affordable. Computer vision strategies for infrastructure inspection leverage the following features: High-definition IoT-connected cameras – including infrared cameras – mounted in remote locations that observe site conditions. Deployment of drones for aerial footage, visual measurements, and automatic identification of potential problems. High-resolution satellite topography imagery to show the current condition and status of assets on the ground. Edge servers running sophisticated AI models that analyze and interpret visual data, identify maintenance issues, detect environmental hazards, and spot instances of fire and overheating. Instant alerts, reports, and metrics sent to decision-makers for immediate action on potential problems. With Chooch AI Vision , industrial companies gain immediate access to a wide library of pre-built visual AI models for the most common inspection use cases. Armed with these tools, customers can develop visual AI models that instantly detect the following concerns: Tree overgrowth Rusty, damaged, or defective structures Overheating, smoke, flares, and fire Leaks in pipes Wastewater effluent and discharges Retention pond and drainage problems Low-hanging or broken power lines Virtually any other visually detectable inspection issue At the end of the day, the ROI benefit of computer vision for industrial computer vision inspections is clear. Whether it’s a large-scale industrial operation, utility company, or governmental organization, computer vision technology empowers faster and more accurate detection of maintenance and environmental concerns – orders of magnitude more affordable than relying on human inspectors alone. Even better, Chooch AI can design and deploy a custom visual AI inspection strategy in only 6 to 9 days. Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

https://www.chooch.com/blog/what-is-an-ai-model/,"What is AI model? | Chooch An AI (artificial intelligence) model is a program that has been trained on a set of data (called the training set ) to recognize certain types of patterns. AI models use various types of algorithms to reason over and learn from this data, with the overarching goal of solving business problems. There are many different fi elds that use AI models with different levels of complexity and purposes, including computer vision , robotics, and natural language processing. As mentioned above, a machine learning algorithm is a procedure that learns from data to perform pattern recognition and creates a machine learning model. Below is a sampling of just a few simple machine learning algorithms: k -nearest neighbors: The k -nearest neighbors algorithm is used to classify data points based on the classification of their k nearest neighbors (where k is some integer). For example, if we have k = 5, then for each new data point, we will give it the same classification as the majority(or the plurality) of its closest neighbors in the data set. Linear regression: Linear regression attempts to define the relationship between multiple variables by fitting a linear equation to a dataset. The output of a linear regression model can then be used to estimate the value of missing points in the dataset. k -means: The k -means algorithm is used to separate a dataset into k different clusters (where k is some integer). We start by randomly choosing k points (called centroids) in space, and assigning each point to the closest centroid. Next, we calculate the mean of all the points that have been assigned to the same centroid. This mean value then becomes the cluster’s new centroid. We repeat the algorithm until it converges, i.e. the position of the centroids does not change. AI and machine learning algorithms are fundamentally mathematical entities, but can also be described using pseudocode , i.e. an informal high-level language that looks somewhat like computer code. In practice, of course, AI models can be implemented with any one of a range of modern programming languages. Today, various open-source libraries (such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Pytorch) make AI algorithms available through their standard application programming interface (API). Finally, an AI model is the output of an AI algorithm run on your training data. It represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions about unseen test data. The decision tree algorithm, for example, creates a model consisting of a tree of if-then statements, each one predicated on specific values. Meanwhile, deep neural network algorithms create a model consisting of a graph structure that contains many different vectors or weights with particular values.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/safety-ai-model-ppe-detection-video/,"Safety AI Model | PPE Detection Video | Chooch Chooch AI is creating AI models that can be deployed quickly into the field with clear benefits. Ensuring that workers wear mandated safety equipment can lower insurance costs, increase productivity and save lives. Watch this video that demonstrates how detects when safety equipment isn’t being worn. Several workers gloves are not wearing cloves, for example, and by sending an alert to a supervision, the workers can receive a message reminding them to keep their gloves on. Chooch AI can quickly and accurately detect these issues across multiple videos feeds. In fact, Chooch AI provides computer vision security for many industries. The ability to detect PPE compliance has a lot of benefits especially reducing the risk of injury and lowering the cost of non-compliance. This means that Chooch AI brings immense value to its partners and customers. Chooch AI’s PPE detection models are pre-trained and ready for deployment. Often, they can be deployed within days because of the pre-training. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection ensures worker safety by protecting them against health and safety risks. When workers don’t wear PPE the risk of injury, contamination and financial losses due to fines go up. AI models that are trained to ensure safety equipment compliance, reduce the risk of injury and lower the cost of non-compliance while ensuring environmental health and safety. Chooch AI Models detect PPE compliance and automate safety in the workplace using the following method: AI models are trained to detect PPE Afterward, AI models process video streams with computer vision. When a lack of PPE compliance is detected, Chooch AI sends alerts and location data to stakeholders indicating that worker safety is at risk.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-for-ppe-compliance-at-industrial-facilities/,"Computer Vision for PPE Compliance at Industrial Facilities | Chooch Certain employees will continually fail to use the PPE equipment and managers may never even notice. Tragically, this results in worsened injuries when an accident occurs. It also causes a host of accident-related costs and operational inefficiencies for businesses. Now, the latest computer vision technology is making PPE enforcement easier than ever — allowing industrial businesses to achieve near-100% PPE compliance while reducing the number and severity of accidents at industrial facilities. Why PPE Compliance Is Critical According to statistics from the International Labor Organization (ILO) , there are approximately 340 million work-related accidents globally each year, and 160 million people suffer from work-related illness. Of these, approximately 2.3 million people die of their injuries and illnesses. With specific regard to workplace accidents , the NYU protective equipment (PPE) standard reports that the vast majority of injuries could have been prevented with the use of appropriate PPE. For example, 70.9% of hand and arm injuries could have been prevented by using safety gloves, and 99% of face injury victims were not wearing facial protection. Costs and Consequences of Inadequate PPE Enforcement Accidents and injuries that result from inadequate PPE enforcement cause the following costs for industrial businesses: Additional accidents and more severe injuries when accidents occur. Greater dissatisfaction among workers due to a workplace culture that doesn’t emphasize worker safety. Reduced productivity due to job site shutdowns and labor shortages following an injurious accident. Higher insurance premiums following serious workplace accidents and OSHA violations. Increased litigation costs due to wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits, lawyer fees, settlements, and other liabilities. More safety citations and fees due to regulator inspections and safety infractions following injurious workplace accidents. Leveraging Computer Vision for Better PPE Compliance The latest computer vision technology can monitor PPE use across every inch of a property to help companies achieve near-100% PPE compliance . Most importantly, these visual AI systems radically reduce work-related injuries and their associated costs and consequences. By using a network of strategically placed, AI-equipped, high-definition cameras, industrial facilities can detect evidence of PPE non-compliance, and send a manager or foreman to educate and remind the employee on appropriate PPE use. The Chooch AI visual AI platform includes pre-made computer vision models—ready for immediate implementation—that detect PPE compliance failures related to: Hard hats Gloves Vests Eye protection Aprons Face shields Harnesses Virtually any type of PPE With Chooch AI, businesses can also train new visual AI models for unique PPE enforcement use cases. Beyond PPE enforcement alone, computer vision for PPE compliance provides a visual record of employees using required PPE. This data may be important in the event of a safety inspection or lawsuit following a serious workplace accident. Case Study: Theft and Safety Glove Inspections Recently, Chooch AI developed a computer vision solution for a nationwide automobile disassembly enterprise with over 400 industrial facilities throughout the United States. Hand-related accidents were the biggest source of workers’ compensation claims for the auto disassembler. Most of these injuries involved cuts, lacerations, and broken bones—and the vast majority could have been avoided by using safety gloves. The auto disassembler was experiencing the following costs and consequences related to hand injuries: Absenteeism and staffing shortages: Employees with hand injuries typically needed to miss 1 to 4 weeks of work. Financial losses: A typical hand injury claim could cost the company between $2,000 and $10,000. A culture of PPE non-compliance: The inability to enforce safety glove use had solidified into a culture of PPE non-compliance that was difficult to break. Chooch AI helped the auto disassembler train and implement a new AI model for PPE safety glove detection. With a simple update to their existing visual AI system for theft detection, Chooch uploaded a patch for safety glove detection across the company’s entire network of 400-plus facilities. Armed with the “eyes-on-the-backs-of-their-heads” solution they were looking for, the auto disassembler started to receive instant alerts of PPE non-compliance pertaining to safety gloves. This allowed managers and foremen to provide the appropriate safety training and coaching to employees. Chooch AI: Computer Vision for PPE Compliance Chooch AI offers enterprises the flexibility to deploy visual AI models for nearly any PPE compliance challenge. With its vast library of pre-built computer vision models, Chooch AI can identify employees that fail to wear gloves, hard hats, aprons, safety glasses, harnesses, and more. Best of all, Chooch AI is so fast and easy to use that businesses can train and deploy unique AI models in just 6 to 9 days. Faster response times: By simultaneously monitoring hundreds of surveillance camera feeds covering every inch of a property, computer vision offers real-time alerts for faster response times as soon as a problem occurs. Dramatically less expensive and more efficient: Working in conjunction with human security personnel, Chooch AI empowers security teams to boost the speed, accuracy, coverage, and cost-efficiency of security-related tasks. By partnering with a robotics provider, Chooch AI developed a computer vision strategy to augment the logistic company’s security coverage while reducing their staffing, training, and management burdens. By seamlessly integrating Chooch AI with drones and robotic “dogs,” the logistics company achieved more accurate monitoring for fence breaches, unauthorized personnel, and a host of premises-related security concerns – without the use of additional human capital and without incurring additional security expenditures.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-defect-detection/,"Computer Vision Defect Detection | Chooch Imagine a manufacturing facility with a team of quality control inspectors that never get tired, never get distracted, and always perform their jobs with laser-point accuracy. Even better, these defect detection inspectors provide their services for a fraction of the usual cost. Until recently, this idea was nothing more than a pipedream. But today, global industrial manufacturers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies are deploying AI-based computer vision technologies to detect manufacturing defects. These AI systems are detecting flaws with levels of accuracy that far exceed the capacity of human inspectors – and they’re also a lot less expensive than human workers. In this article, we’ll look at why computer vision defect detection systems are needed in manufacturing facilities and how visual AI defect detection works. We’ll also discover some exciting real-world use cases for this technology in manufacturing and CPG facilities. The Need for Visual AI Defect Detection in Manufacturing Manufacturing and CPG defects can be costly. According to Marsh.com , product defects can trigger enormous costs and expenditures related to: Notifying retailers and customers about defective products Identifying and tracking down defective products Transporting and repackaging defective products Destroying and disposing of defective products Replacing defective products with better-built items free of defects Adverse publicity that damages the manufacturer’s reputation Loss of revenue that results from adverse publicity The cost of marketing and public relations efforts to rehabilitate sales and rebuild customer trust Of these expenditures, Allianz claims that “the biggest single cost of a product recall event is the loss of sales and business interruption, both from the recall itself and the reputational damage.” There is also the potential for legal costs related to defective product liability lawsuits . According to Allianz, “defective product incidents have caused insured losses in excess of $2 billion over the past five years, making them the largest generator of liability losses.” Considering these costs, the ROI benefits of catching defects before they leave the manufacturing facility is obvious. However, human defect inspectors can only do so much to identify manufacturing errors at industrial factories and CPG facilities. While most manufacturing facilities have a longstanding history of relying on human defect inspectors, humans employed in visual inspection tasks are prone to getting tired, distracted, and making serious and costly errors. This is where a visual AI quality control system can help. Visual AI systems for defect detection are not only more affordable than human defect detection staff, but they are also more accurate when it comes to finding and reporting defects. How Visual AI Defect Detection Works Modern Visual AI technologies rely on powerful cloud-based servers that allow them to rapidly ingest visual information for machine-learning training purposes. By training a computer vision system with hundreds of thousands or millions of images of specific types of product defects, these systems can learn to rapidly identify similar defects with a high degree of accuracy. Visual AI defect detection systems can identify flaws like bottles missing bottlecaps, cracks in pipelines, poorly painted surfaces, missing parts, broken items, misshaped items, cracked glass, cracked metal casings, and virtually any other type of errors that human visual inspectors identify. After setting up a high-quality camera system along the assembly line of a manufacturing facility – and connecting the cameras to the visual AI system – facilities can detect, flag, remove, and replace defective products more efficiently and successfully, thereby circumventing the massive costs and workflow inefficiencies that these errors cause. Best of all, this is achieved vastly more affordably than relying on human laborers. The most advanced visual AI inspection technologies – such as Chooch.com – can spawn lightweight “Edge AI” systems that run in the cloud. These systems can immediately integrate with an existing IoT infrastructure of cameras. They can also automatically deploy to the Edge through cloud-based dashboards and APIs. Finally, Edge AI technology makes the integration and replication of a trained visual AI defect detection system easier and more efficient across an entire enterprise. Use Case Examples for Visual AI Defect Detection in Manufacturing We have identified an endless range of visual AI defect detection use cases. These use cases apply to industrial manufacturing plants, CPG facilities, quality controls for infrastructure, airline industry safety, and more. Ultimately, whenever a manufacturing facility employs human laborers to visually inspect for defects, an AI-based computer vision system can likely perform the same task with greater efficiency and fewer errors. Here are several use case examples for a visual AI defect detection system: Industrial manufacturing plants: Industrial manufacturing facilities must meet specific levels of quality – not only because they must provide defect-free products to their customers, but also due to industry standards and government regulations. With a Chooch computer vision system , organizations can train a visual AI system to detect the most important defects that interfere with product quality at an industrial manufacturing plant. These could relate to cracks in casings, broken products, missing parts, unsightly scratches, dust on painted items, structural integrity problems, poorly painted items, and more. CPG production facilities: Consumer packaged goods manufacturers must meet some of the highest safety and quality standards that exist. Visual inspectors need to identify discolored potato chips, unsightly or rotten food products, packaging defects, and other defects. An appropriately trained Chooch.AI system can identify these kinds of defects –  including blackened potato chips, misshapen food products, uncapped soft drinks, leaking products, broken glass, and poorly packaged items. Quality control for infrastructure: When it comes to the large machinery used in manufacturing – and essential infrastructure items required for mining, oil drilling, and other large-scale operations – visual AI systems can ensure that vital pieces of an operational infrastructure are free of problems and defects. For example, an IoT network of visual AI cameras can monitor oil pipelines and machinery for signs of stress and wear. These systems can also monitor an oil rig for safety-related problems, detecting them before a costly shutdown or dangerous accident occurs. Airline industry safety: Boeing reports that the airline industry spends approximately $40 billion per year on inspections and maintenance related to the safety and proper functioning of jets, engines, and other airline equipment. These expenditures relate to “the costs of the labor and materials required to perform servicing, repair, modification, restoration, inspection, test, and troubleshooting tasks during on-airplane and shop maintenance activities.” Visual AI defect detection systems – including drone-based visual AI systems – facilitate visual inspections related to airline equipment maintenance and safety.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/what-is-an-edge-device/,"What is Edge Device? | Chooch The massive growth of IoT devices and its new applications is driving edge ai with an explosive increase in revenues expected to go from 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 to 9 billion by 2024. The rise of edge computing has been significantly transforming how organizations are collecting their data, processing it, and gaining insights for more data-driven business decisions. But, what is an edge device? What are edge devices? Edge computing is a distributed topology where data storage and processing are done close to the edge devices where it’s being collected, rather than relying on a central location that can be thousands of miles away. Edge devices are hardware components that control data flow at the boundary between two networks where they serve as network entry (or exit) points. Enterprises and service providers use edge devices for transmitting, routing, processing, monitoring, filtering, translating, and storing data passing between networks. Examples of edge devices include cameras, sensors, routers, integrated access devices, multiplexers, and a variety of metropolitan area network and wide area network access devices. What are benefits of running inferencing on edge devices? Speed and Latency Analyzing data, especially real-time data, in edge devices, eliminates latency issues that can affect performance. The less time it takes to analyze data, the more value that comes from it. For example, when it comes to autonomous vehicles, time is of the essence, and most of the data it gathers and processes is useless after a couple of seconds. Enhanced Security The distributed architecture that comes with edge computing enables organizations to distribute security risks as well, which diminishes the impact of attacks on the organization as a whole. Edge computing enables organizations to overcome local compliance and privacy regulations’ issues, as well. Cost Savings Edge computing helps companies to reduce costs associated with transporting, managing, and securing data. By keeping data within your edge locations, you optimize bandwidth usage to connect all of your locations. Reliability Business operations continuity may require local processing of data to avoid possible network outages. Storing and processing data in edge devices improves reliability, and temporary disruptions in network connectivity won’t impact the devices’ operations. How do edge devices work? Edge devices have a very simple working principle; it serves as network entry or exit and connects two different networks by translating one protocol into another. Moreover, it creates a secure connection with the cloud. An edge device is a plug-and-play; its setup is quick and straightforward. It is configured via local access and also has a port to connect it to the internet and the cloud. How do edge devices offer a better AI experience? Many Artificial intelligence use-cases are better done on edge devices, offering maximum availability, data security, reduced latency, and optimized costs. Running Machine learning models can be computationally expensive in cloud-based environments. Meanwhile, inference needs relatively low computing resources. When AI models are trained on the cloud, data needs to be transferred from end-devices to predict outputs. This needs a stable connection, and since the volume of data is large, the transfer can be slow or, in some cases, impossible. Edge AI moves algorithms closer to the data source where they’re processed locally without requiring any connection offering real-time analytics in less than few milliseconds The volumes of data are significantly increasing, so is the need to process it autonomously. Enabling Deep Learning algorithms to perform EdgeTraining locally is a must-have feature for many applications such as autonomous vehicles. IoT edge devices are now able to run machine learning models locally within the device using TensorFlow, Pytorch, or other machine learning tools. The thing that enables capabilities to be handled directly on a device. Localizing the data reduces the latency that results from sending the data to the cloud, and it enables more immediate insights generated by devices. Massive changes are initiated with Edge AI raising demand for IoT smart devices, and the emergence of more advanced technologies. As organizations are increasingly adopting Edge AI to make their operations better and enable real-time performance, the market will significantly grow to keep pace with the computing requirements of these smart items. How does Chooch use Edge AI to help businesses? Chooch Edge AI helps organizations to take their video analytics and IoT applications to the next level.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/training-computer-vision-with-data-augmentation/,"Training Computer Vision With Data Augmentation | Chooch Computer vision and artificial intelligence need a lot of data. The more volume and variety of data that you can show to your model during AI training, the more high-performance and robust the model will be when examining data in the real world that it hasn’t seen before. There’s just one issue: what if you only have a limited amount of data in the first place? That’s where data augmentation comes in. For example, suppose you want to train a computer vision model to recognize different cat breeds. To achieve the best results, your model should train on a balanced dataset that has roughly the same number of images for each breed. It should be easy enough to find thousands of images of the most popular breeds, such as Persians and Siamese cats, but what about extremely rare breeds such as the LaPerm or the Sokoke ? Without correcting this imbalance, your model can achieve a very high accuracy on the training data simply by learning to recognize the most popular (and therefore overrepresented) breeds. However, this strategy won’t do as well in the real world—for example, a breed recognition quiz that treats all breeds equally, with a single question about each one. Don’t have enough data to train your AI model ? No problem. Below, we’ll discuss a powerful strategy for computer vision to accomplish the (seemingly) impossible: augmenting 2D images. Data Augmentation for 2D Images Data augmentation is a useful technique for expanding the size of your dataset without having to find or generate new images. How is this possible? Suppose you have a single image of a cat that you want to augment within your dataset. The transformations that you can make to this image without changing the correct answer (e.g., “Persian” or “American Shorthair”) include: Flipping the image (horizontally or vertically) Rotating the image Scaling the image (e.g., zooming in or out) Cropping the image Placing the foreground object onto a new background Altering the hue of the image What are the benefits of augmenting 2D images for computer vision ? By slightly modifying the original image, you can create perhaps dozens of augmented images. This makes it harder for the AI model to overfit (i.e., learning to recognize the data itself instead of learning the underlying patterns and concepts). For example, a robust AI model for cat breeds should still be able to identify the correct breeds even when the original images are rotated to be upside down. How to Augment 2D Images with Chooch There’s just one question left: how can you perform 2D data augmentation for computer vision ? Without technical experts on hand, trying to build your own scripts and workflows might suck up valuable time that you could instead spend fine-tuning the model and getting better results. Fortunately, there’s an answer to this question: powerful, user-friendly computer vision platforms like Chooch. With Chooch, you can augment your existing images in just a few clicks, performing various transformations to make your dataset more robust. Working in Chooch’s user-friendly dashboard, you can upload an annotated image of your choice, and then select the pre-built transformations and augmentations you want to perform. You can then deploy this model wherever you need it, including on edge devices . In order to generate the most useful augmented images, data augmentation in Chooch can only be performed on source images with bounding box annotations. The transformations available within the Chooch dashboard for data augmentation include: Shifting, scaling, and rotating Horizontally flipping Cutting out the background Adding noise and blurring Changing the brightness and contrast You can choose the default values for these transformations, or tweak and fine-tune the intensity of each augmentation yourself. You can also adjust the number of augmented images to be generated from each source image. Once you’ve adjusted the settings to your liking, Chooch will create the augmented dataset with just a click in a matter of seconds.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/what-is-an-ai-computer/,"What is an AI Computer? | Chooch As the name suggests, an AI computer is any computing machine that can do work in the field of artificial intelligence. Thanks to the rapid pace of technological developments, even modest consumer hardware can today be considered an “AI computer,” capable of running cutting-edge ai models . The past few decades have seen tremendous strides in AI computing technology . In the 1980s and 1990s, for example, when computing power came at a premium, machines had to be specially built and configured to do AI work. Now, the average laptop has three of the most crucial components for any AI computer: Graphical processing unit (GPU): Originally created for real-time computer graphics, the GPU excels at any task that requires massively parallel processing, including many types of AI models (such as deep learning). Central processing unit (CPU): Work that can’t be offloaded to the GPU on an AI computer is instead run on the CPU, which you can think of as the machine’s “brain.” But technological progress has made CPUs more and more powerful with a higher number of cores capable of handling many tasks that were previously GPU-exclusive. Software: The past decade has seen an explosion in the availability of AI and machine learning frameworks and software. Even relative beginners to programming can use these tools to spin up powerful AI models in just a few lines of code. The choice of operating system is also an important factor when building an AI computer: UNIX-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS are significantly more convenient for programmers, and many AI frameworks have been optimized for Linux versions such as Ubuntu and Red Hat. Windows computers can present compatibility issues with some AI tools, but the operating system itself is so widespread that it should always be taken into account. macOS is convenient in terms of software, but Macintosh hardware still lags behind Linux and Windows when it comes to sheer power (although Apple has been trying to catch up by introducing new chips). How does AI computing software work? The dominant form of AI these days is deep learning, which uses an AI model known as the neural network. Machine learning engineers use deep learning software frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow to build AI models with just a few keystrokes, and then train them on the GPU. Composed of many interconnected nodes called “neurons” organized in multiple layers, neural networks are a rough simulation of the structure of the human brain. Each connection between two neurons has a corresponding weight, whose value determines the importance given that connection (larger values represent stronger connections). Neural networks are trained using an algorithm called backpropagation, that automatically adjusts the weights of the neural network when the model makes an incorrect prediction. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a special form of neural network optimized for analyzing visual imagery, such as photographs and videos. AI platforms such as Chooch can process and interpret any kind of visual input, from X-rays and sonograms to video cameras and infrared satellite images. Want to turn your enterprise IT systems into a powerful AI computer? We can help. Chooch is a robust, feature-rich, easy-to-use platform for visual AI and computer vision . Get in touch with our team of AI experts today for a chat about your business needs and objectives, or to start your free trial of the Chooch platform. Why is this AI Computer thing happening now? Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have never been so widespread or so accessible to the masses – that’s why AI computers have become a thing. To incorporate artificial intelligence into your own workflows, of course, you need an AI computer. In a 2020 report, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company found that half of organizations “have adopted AI in at least one function.” Also, businesses who derive the most value from AI report that they’ve experienced benefits such as better performance, higher growth rates, and stronger leadership.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/synthetic-data-webinar-faster-ai-model-generation-more-accurate-computer-vision/,"Synthetic Data Webinar | Faster AI Model Generation | Chooch To build accurate computer vision models, you need data—and lots of it. Now, you can generate images with synthetic data and augmented data on the Chooch AI platform , and then use these synthetic images to train and deploy computer vision models. What you’ll learn in this webinar is how to use different technologies with the same goal: deploying accurate computer vision even faster. Watch the video or read the transcript below. Emrah Gultekin: So thank you all for joining in today. And what we’re going to do today, we’re going to run through a lot of material. And so if you have questions, you can ask them during or after the webinar. But basically, what we’re talking about today is synthetic data . And it’s a part of generating data so that you can train the AI. And so at the end of the day, what we’re talking about really is some of the inferencing that goes on, and the problem that you’re trying to solve. So let’s say you’re tasked to detect something and it’s not in a pre-trained model, there are no pre-trained classifications for it or if they are, they’re not really good. So at the end of the day, what you’re trying to do here is, you’re trying to generate better inferences. So this is where it all happens. And the inference or the prediction … You’re sending in video feed, or images and what’s happening is you’re getting responses for that. So it’s detecting simple things like cars and people, faces and so forth, very complex things like parts or scratches or types of cells, and so forth. So you can do a lot of stuff. So it really ends up here in inferencing. Which is important for us and important for the clients as well and also a part of all the ecosystem partners out there. But what’s happening is, if you go back to the cycle here, it really begins with data. So today, we’re going to be talking about these things and that is data generation to train a model. So it goes into here. And we’re not going to be talking about model training today but all of you who are on this call know something about this. But what you do is you create data, and then you train the model, then you do the inferencing. And the inferencing helps you create data again. So this is like a cycle here that goes back and forth. So today we’re going to be talking about data generation through a series of tools. This is not just synthetic data, you’ve got manual annotation, you’ve got smart annotation and data augmentation, so forth. So today we’re going to be talking clearly about this. The result is inferencing all the time, so increasing the accuracy, increasing the stability of the model and creating those dynamic models that we all dream of. So the question becomes, where do you get the data? So the data, you have public data sets, you’ve got client data sets, you can do web scraping and so forth. But at the end of the day, the issue has always been … And this is particular in visual detection, and that’s what we’re talking about today, the visual AI. In particular, what you’re seeing is that the models that you train, you need to have a lot of data. And this is like in the thousands of images per class. So where do you really get that data? There are ways to do it. You can scrape, you can get client data, you can get public datasets and so forth. But it’s usually not annotated, it’s unstructured. And it’s not enough. So that’s the question here is, where do you get it? And one way to do is to synthesize the data. And that’s what we’re going to talk about today is getting some base data, some real data and then synthesizing that to create diverse data sets in order to generate the data set necessary to train the model or train multiple models at the same time. So this is what this is about. And on our platform , you can do this but you can also import already generated data sets from somewhere else and generate the model. So you don’t really have to do it on our system, you can do it on a partner system, on another ecosystem partner who actually does this type of data set creations as well or if there are people who do annotation and so forth. So you can actually upload data sets that are already created somewhere else and then generate the model with one click basically. So the problem here is data sets require lots of labeled, high quality, and usually copyright free images. So that’s a lot of stuff and it’s very difficult to overcome that. And so in order to do this, your goal is to generate a computer vision model that can work in real environments. And this means you really need a lot of images in sufficient variation. This could be coming through video frames or it could be coming through images itself and whatnot, but you really need a substantial amount of them. And the data that you generate has to have a minimum of labeling errors. So it’s not enough to just have raw data, maybe having files that are labeled but you also need to annotate them, especially if you’re doing object detection. And this is a very slow process to do this manually and intrusive lots of errors and takes a long time. It’s not scalable, basically. So manual annotation, it’s necessary. You have to do that because that’s how you see the AI and you see the model, see the data set but it’s not scalable for a number of reasons. Humans are not scalable. So the conclusion is you generate synthetic images of the annotated objects to train a model and detect real world situation. So this is really what we’re doing here. So you need lots, labeled, it needs to be high quality. So the workflow and methodology we have here at Chooch AI is quite simple actually. You sculpt the problem with the client or with the partner. Basically what the case is, what is the client trying to detect? What are they trying to detect? And usually, the answer to this is not that simple. And sometimes you have to walk through with the client to understand what they’re actually trying to achieve with visual detection. You sculpt the case and basically on the technical side, you start to check the performance of the pre-trained models or existing models. So you want to be able to use a pre-trained models as much as possible to deploy a model or inference engine to the client. But you also have to understand that usually, these pre-trained models are not sufficient for production purposes unless they’re done for a specific purpose. Then what happens is you generate data. And basically what you’re doing is you’re reading this data to augment the data that already exists there or generate something from scratch. The best way to understand if your data set is good it to train a model and then test it. And then when you deploy it, you get feedback from the users and then that goes into the data set again. So it’s the cycle where you’re generating models which are dynamic. So if you’re just generating a model that’s static and you say this works out of the box for everything, that’s usually not the case. You need user feedback, you need different types of feedback to enhance the data set as you move forward. So this is a more extensive workflow here. But basically what it is, understand the available data in the detection requirements from the client. You generate the data for data gaps, that’s the second step of that, train and test the models. So you’re trying to increase the accuracy of the model. And that is the F1 score that we talk about which is a harmonized mean between precision and recall. You want to increase that. Then you deploy the models, receive feedback from users on correct, incorrect or unknown objects or maybe there’s something new that needs to be trained, you want to put a new class in. So you can receive that feedback directly from users annotated or not annotated. And put that feedback back into the data set and retrain the model. So you have that cycle there where the workflow is very crucial to the scalability of this entire system. So these are some of the tools that we use on our system, you have obviously manual data set labeling, you got smart annotation, 2D synthetic data, 3D synthetic data, data augmentation. So today, we’re going to be talking about these which are really related to data set generation, you go into model training and dense training, cloud inferencing, F1 score calculation, unknown object detection, user feedback and edge inferencing, device stream management. So you have this gamut that you need to be able to do to deploy at scale with clients. But today we’re going to be talking about these with which is synthetic data , and some of the annotation tools that we have. We have manual annotation, obviously very, very important. And then you have video annotation, which is annotating a video and then having the tracking system track that object throughout the video and generate a data set based on that, which generates hundreds of thousands of images through a video, basically. And then you have smart annotation with AI, which is using the inference engine, again, to annotate new data. So this is part of that cycle where you need the inference engine to do the annotation work. And so our core is the inference engine as a company. So we’ve focused totally on that. And it’s important to understand that really closes the loop on the dynamic model creation cycle. Data augmentation is also very important here. And then you have synthetic 2D data and then synthetic 3D data. So we’re going to go through these today. So manual annotation is very straightforward. It’s pretty much people drawing bounding boxes or polygons around objects. It’s a painstaking process and it requires training, and it’s not very skilled. But actually it’s a very important part of this because if you don’t have the manual annotation, you can’t really teach the AI new things and increase their accuracy of the inference engine. So even if you have a machine annotating, it is really based on the human who annotated initially that data set to train the model to do the inferencing for the annotation. So it’s a very important part of this process. And this is a basic thing from our dashboard. You have the … Basically just growing bounding boxes around it and you can label it whatever you want. And you continue doing this through the entire data set. And then you have these different classes over here, which will show up as you annotate. And this is part of that. So you see the entire gamut of images that are produced in that data set. And you can see a video over here as well which is actually part of this. And then you can see here that you have synthetic data , you have smart annotation, and you have augmentation as well. And you can add images to this data set and whatnot. The video annotation is also very important because it allows you to scale the amount of frames that are being put into the data set. And this is an important tool, especially if you’re doing something very specific for a specific task, it actually tracks that entire object, unknown object it tracks unknown object, unknown action through the life cycle, through that video, and then generates images into that data set. So this is a conveyor, uploading this … It’s just an MP4 video. And basically, what you do is you click on it, and you start annotating. And you can choose which area of the video you want to annotate. You’ve got an orange part here, and then you’ve got a blue part, and basically you click on annotate process and it’s processing it. And it’ll just follow these through the video and generate a data set for it. So you do once and it’s already generated like 80 images each of that. So this is a very important tool especially if you’re doing something very specific in a specific field or you have lots of video and you want to annotate it. And then you generate this data set for you. Another powerful tool or smart annotation. And this is something that we launched a few months ago. And basically what it is, is you’re using the inference engine to annotate already known objects. And these give a pre trained by our system or can be pre-trained by the user, by the enterprise who’s already using the system. And you can use your custom object models, or you can use basically pre-trained Chooch object models as well. And it automatically annotates entire image data without manual labeling. So it’ll annotate everything and then you can review the annotation done by the machine. This is a very important tool, again, the inference engine. Inference engine has to be very strong to be able to do these types of things. So we got some spark plugs here. You click on the smart annotation, and you press my object models, press a spark plug and you press start and these are unannotated, these images, and what basically happens is when you press start on this, it automatically annotates everything in the data set with the spark plug. And then you can use that to train the model. So you’re actually … What you’re doing is you’re constantly building a data set, automating the building of the data set through these tools in order to train the model as you move forward. Data augmentation as well is very, very important. And this is something that’s done on the back end of some of the already existing deep learning frameworks. But what you really want to do is be able to tune it, if you’re a power user. And so in some instances, your data … Even if you have a lot of data, it’s still not enough to train the model because it doesn’t have the right views or there’s not enough noise and so forth. So you want to be able to do data augmentation here and to do it on the system as well. It helps generalize the existing data set basically. So we have a part data set here, it’s part of the spark plug. And then what you’re basically doing is upload … Let’s say you have these five images of these different things, and they’re annotated and you annotate them basically. And then you have these images here with the different parts, press augmentation and you can … This is over here and press the augmentation thing and it pops this up. And you can go up to 100 iterations, we don’t recommend that, we recommend three or four X the amount, it just over fits but you can play around with it basically. So it’s rotation, horizontal flip, cut out, shifting, scaling, basic things that you do and there are default settings here but if you want to play around with it, you can do that. That’s fine. And scaling, rotation, noise, blur, brightness, contrast, and you start the augmentation on the entire data set basically, randomize it … Based on randomization principle and then it generates all this. So you’ve got 1000 of each here, which is a lot. And then you can use that to train the data set basically. You can see here that this is quite different from the original one, that’s flipping around, changing the noise, changing the lighting, and coloring and all that. Another tool, which is very, very important is the 2D synthetic data. It’s almost like a combination of augmentation and synthetic data. It’s a lot of augmentation, actually. But what you’re basically doing is you’re creating bounding box free transformations, and it’s auto background removal. So when you annotate something, it segments that out and places in different environments basically, and that’s what this is about. Rotates it, flips it around, does a lot of different distancing, and then creates that data set for it. And it’s all randomized and that’s basically part of this process. So we go back to a part data set here. And this is the same part. So I have a quick release part here. And I want to create a 2D of this. And I’m creating another thousand maxim object count per image. And you can choose the different themes that you have. You can use your themes, or you can use our themes. And this is basically just background. So based on what that environment is, it could be the sky, it could be industrial and so forth. And you choose the raw data here, conveyor belt, background and they’re generated. So I’ve got a conveyor belt background here, I generate that and basically it generates all these images with these parts on conveyor belt. And these may not look that realistic but it’s good enough for the randomization of the data set. And that’s what you’re trying to do. Randomize the data set so that it creates a more robust model. So we can move on to 3D synthetic data , which is also important. But it’s important to understand that not all companies have CAD files. And this is a requirement for 3D synthetic data, you need to have a object file and the material file. So it’s textures and the object, and you just basically upload it. And it’s similar to the 2D that you choose a background theme and number of images and it generates it with the bounding boxes inside of it. Let’s do this in 3D data set. So you can see here it’s ATR 42 object. And then it looks like this, you rotate around and do what you need to do with it. And basically, what you’re doing is how many images do you want to generate, press … You have advanced settings here for power users, and that’s like gray scale, in object files as well. You can take out and randomize that and then basically press choose themes or your own theme, and then this is in the air so it’s sky. And then basically say generate. And it’ll generate these and all you have is you get this data set where you have 3000 images of the ATR 42. And then these are some of the sample images that come out. So again, these are semi-realistic but good enough for the data set to be generated to train the model. And that’s what this is really about. Normally best practice is always to use real data to augment any type of synthetic data and vice versa. So if you do have real data, it’s important to have that as context because things may be out of context as well. So it’s important to generate these together at the same time. So what’s the result here. I mean, why are we doing this? This is I. Very well. It’s higher F1 scores, higher accuracy and dynamic models. So model drift, you’ve got problems with accuracy, and you need that feedback and data set to generate constantly higher F1 scores. So here, what you can’t do on the system is you can upload a data set, that’s what we’re going to do, a test data set, parts testing data set. You upload the entire data set which is already annotated. And it’ll start generating F1 and then give you that score. So in order to make this a very quick process of understanding how that model actually is delivered and is being used and what the accuracy is, you need to be able to have this test data set. And then you get the different types of F1 scores here based on that. We usually recommend deploying after 90, you can deploy on production. Anything below 90, it depends on the use case but can be problematic. So you can see that here and then automatically deploy on any of the devices that you might have or just use the API cloud. So we can go on to questions now and I will just stop sharing this. Actually I’ll keep sharing because I might refer back to it. Yeah. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Thanks, Emrah. That was a pretty complete overview of how we generate data. So we do have a few questions. For the benefit of those who don’t know, please explain why should we use synthetic data? I think we’ve answered that. Emrah Gultekin: Let me get into detail on these questions because this is quite important. You don’t have to. Synthetic data is not a must for everything, it’s a tool. It’s a component of something to do if you choose to do that, depending on how much data you already have. If you do have real data, that’s always better. But from our experience in the market, it’s very difficult to come across that and synthesize that data. I’ll give you an example from text recognition. So text detection, text recognition, it would not exist today without synthetic data. That stuff is all synthetic, understanding texts in the natural environment. So we believe that’s going to be the case with object detection and image classification as well. But it’s not a must to be able to train a model, you don’t need it to train a model but these are just tools to help. And again, there are companies that we partner with that generate synthetic data as well, or do annotation work. And you can upload those into the system and train the model. Our core as a company has always been the inference engine. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, the next question, is it possible to try the synthetic data generation tool before committing to a trial in the system? Emrah Gultekin: Oh, yes it is. So just get in touch with us. We’ll upgrade you to enterprise for a trial without a fee basically, so you can use it. It’s out of the box. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. It just requires that you … For the 3D synthetic generation, as Emrah said, you need a CAD file to make that go. Emrah Gultekin: CAD and material file, yeah texture. If you don’t have the MTL File, the textures won’t be randomized basically. Jeffrey Goldsmith: So is this a web based tool or does require local scripting coding and Docker deployment? Emrah Gultekin: So this is a web based tool. And it all resides on the cloud. So you can basically log in from anywhere and use it. So the annotation tools and some of the synthetic tools, that’s all web based. And the inferencing is also web based, unless you want the inference engine deployed on the edge or on-prem and you can do that through the system as well. So you can set up a device like any of the Nvidia GPUs, even the Jetson devices and then pull the Docker and have the inferencing run on the edge as well. But yeah, you can use it on the cloud. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. And you can sign up today in the upper right corner of the website and start using it. We have a question. What challenges have you seen in using 3D synthetic data? Challenges, Emrah? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so 3D synthetic data or 2D synthetic data, it’s not a panacea. It’s not going to solve all your problems, it’s not going to … And so the issue has been the expectations of the market. And the 3D synthetic data in particular is harder to come by because it requires a 3D model of that particular object. And so that usually … If you’re a manufacturer of that object, you probably have it. But outside of that, you’re not going to get a 3D model unless you work with let’s say, a 3D model designing company that can generate those. But that’s been the challenge with 3D is just getting the CAD and the texture files ready. And that’s something that is overcome by some of the clients that we work with. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, the next question is quite important. I suppose this person missed the beginning of the presentation. Can we create models using Chooch or just generate data? And the answer is yes. The point of creating data is to generate models. So we generate data, we create models, and then we do inferencing, the whole life cycle is there it at Chooch AI . Emrah Gultekin: So the whole point of generating the data is to create a model. And so you can do that on the system as well. We can go into more detail on that on another webinar. But basically, our whole thing has been the inference engine, which is the model itself. And by the way, to test the data set, the best thing to do is to train it because you’re never going to be able to test it otherwise properly. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Right. And that leads us into our next question, which is, could you give a more intuitive explanation of what an F1 score is? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So F1 it’s what data scientists like to use but it’s basically another … It’s a fancy name for accuracy. So accuracy is made up of two things. It’s basically precision, which you would say false positive. So is this an airplane? If it says it’s a helicopter, that’s a false positive. And then you have recall, where it should have detected something but it didn’t. And that would be a false negative. So it’s basically just an average of those two. It’s just a fancy name for accuracy. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. We are getting some questions in chat too. So I employ you to enter your questions in the Q&A, but we’ll get to the chat questions after we’re done with the Q&A. Let’s see here. Any recommendations on how much synthetic versus real data is needed for a successful computer vision model batch size? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. We can talk about our system where you create the models, we recommend a minimum of 1000 images per class. And so that would be … Depending on the use case that you’re doing, real data, you want to have at a minimum of 100, 150. So about 10 to 15% of that. And then you can generate some 2D on that and some data augmentation. 3D is a separate deal. You can generate more on that and there are different types of best practices for that. But you want to get to about 1000 images. How you get to there, that’s up to you. You can use synthetic, you can use … If you have real, that’s always better. But a minimum of 1000 and then just keep going up from 1000 for production purposes. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. Do you support deployment on mobile? We actually have a mobile app. But I really want to … Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so the deployment on a mobile is through an API. So we’ll be hitting the cloud. If you’re talking about the models being deployed on mobile, we don’t do that at the moment. But we do deploy on Nvidia Jetson devices, also Intel CPUs as well. But in terms of the mobile apps, it’s traditionally been just API call on the cloud. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah, we actually have a mobile app if you search in any app store for Chooch IC2. You can install it on your phone and try it. It basically sends screen grabs from your video feed to the cloud and it sends back metadata. It’s pretty cool, actually. So next question, how important is it to train the data with different backgrounds? Can we load our own backgrounds with different conditions and lightings to train? There we go. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, it’s a good question. So we have some preset backgrounds that you can use. But usually what happens is the client has their own warehouse or manufacturing area, then they can load up that background as well. And so you can use that background to synthesize your data as well. So that’s under my themes. And basically, you just … You can upload to a data set itself or you can upload to raw data, and just pull that in when you click onto my themes. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, great question. What if my data is sensitive and cannot go out of my company? Is it possible to deploy it on company servers? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so this is a great question. And what we’re doing is we have … The inference engine is Dockerized. And you can deploy the inference engine on prem, which means none of that video inferencing or image inferencing will leave your device or your on prem installation. For the entire system, we’re working on Dockerizing that, including the training system and the data generation system, and we have clients who are waiting for that actually. It’s quite important. So we’re going to have that out by the end of the summer where you can basically take it and use it anywhere you want on any of the servers. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. And the next question is a comment. We need a webinar on model creation. Well, I’m sure we’ll publish one on that very soon. Is there an advantage to using a tight bounding polygon over a simple bounding box, advantages of background removal? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, that’s a very good question. So depending on your use case, bounding box or polygon, you’re going to choose between the two basically. And data scientists know which ones work for what. For 90% of use cases that we do, bounding box is fine. But even the bounding box itself, it actually segments that piece out. And that’s how the 2D generation is generated. So background removal is crucial. You cannot do background removal without polygon segmentation. And that’s how the 2D synthetic works. But in terms of inferencing and creating data set, bounding boxes are usually enough for generic deployments. We have sensitive deployment like satellite imagery or radiology, you definitely need polygon. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yep. We already answered to some degree, perhaps you’re getting to dive into this a little bit. Do you support edge inferencing? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, we support edge inferencing. The inference engine is exportable into the GPU devices and also Intel devices. And it’s basically a Docker that you pull and it gets set up within half an hour. And you can put models onto it, you can do updates, you can erase models, you can visualize the inferencing on it. So yes, edge inferencing is a crucial part of this whole system because if you don’t have edge inferencing, it’s virtually impossible to scale video in the long run. Jeffrey Goldsmith: And we’ve actually got documentation on how to deploy to the edge on our website, under the products section at the bottom. There’s a few different help documents. Next, synthetic data looks different. How can we know it will perform well? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so it looks different and you’re going to have to iterate on it. And that’s what we do as well. And the way to iterate is you create a model, basically. And you create the model on the system and see how it performs, test it on the system that you’ve created the synthetic data on, it’s basically all together. So you’re right, you need to iterate on these. It’s not going to perform well the first time. It’ll perform … Depends on the use case, obviously but usually it takes us about four to five iterations to get to a model that is production ready. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Pretty technical question here. Do you use GANs or VAEs to create synthetic data? Emrah Gultekin: This is a good question. And we are not using GANs or VAEs to create yet, but we’re using randomization. I think some our ML engineers can answer this much better. But basically, we’re in the process of putting GANs into the system, though, as we speak. It’s a good question. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Here’s a pretty good on thought leadership question, what impact will synthetic data generation have on the future of computer vision? Emrah Gultekin: It’s going to be a … So think of it this way, you do have a lot of data out there. But it’s unstructured. And our duty as people in the computer vision industry or AI and generalist is to structure that data. So the way you structure data is by seeding it through the inference engine in order to detect things. So the impact it will have on computer vision is enormous in terms of getting the models out and having different types of models. We think it is. Synthetic data is very, very important. But again, it’s a tool. It’s not the end all in this. So we don’t want to overemphasize something. It is an important tool but it is part of a larger thing that’s going on in computer vision. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Is the background combined with data and synthesized? I’m not quite sure I understand the question there. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. I think I do but maybe I’m wrong. So in 3D synthetic data, you have the object file, the CAD file, the material file, MTL and then you choose a background as well. So you choose the background images. It could be an already generated theme on the system that we have or it could be your own theme. So it is synthesizing randomize with those backgrounds. So the background is not synthesized. The background is what you put into the system. So you might have like 2000 images of background of your warehouse and that’s where you’re going to be placing those different objects. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. The last question in Q&A and then we’ll move over to the chat. Can you please explain using randomization for synthetic data generation? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So in terms of randomization, you have different tools here that you are able to … There are toggle switches basically. So if you’re a power user, you can randomize the way you want and basically, place things in the places you want or you just use general randomization. And it’s on a randomization principle, where you can basically just let the machine randomize what it’s doing. But what’s important here is if you are a power user, you want to be able to control that randomization. And so you have those toggle switches in advanced settings to do that. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Emrah, are there any particular verticals that … E.g manufacturing where you see more adoption of synthetic data? Emrah Gultekin: Honestly, the clients don’t care about the use of synthetic data or real data, or what type of data you’re generating. What they really care about is how the model performs out of the box, how the model performs in their environment. So what we’re seeing more and more though is that the synthetic data is being used more in certain verticals where there’s a lack of data or lack of structured data, and manufacturing is one of them actually. But we’re seeing it more in geospatial. Jeffrey Goldsmith: We keep getting questions, which is fine, we still have some time here. How can you generate, for example, a partially covered stop sign with automated labeling? I mean … Emrah Gultekin: It’s a good question. And so this goes into CGI really and it is a universe unto itself. So you need a CGI person to create that base data to generate that. [crosstalk 00:54:46]. So you generate one of them and then basically the system randomize the rest. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Exactly. Is it possible to train them on like … We answered this to some degree but is it possible to train the model and export it in order run it without Chooch? Emrah Gultekin: This is a good question because what happens is these models that you see on the Chooch system are not really single models. They’re always ensembles, and they’re encoded with information from the past, from the purpose that it has already generated over the years. So it’s not possible to do it without the Chooch system on prem or on a device, but you’re able to export the system as well. So you can export the system to wherever you want to, but you can’t take these models out of a vacuum and have them perform. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Let’s see here, could you say which one works better, training the model with synthetic data entirely and later fine tuning the model with real data or training the model with a hybrid data, synthetic data and real data? Depends on the use case. Emrah Gultekin: So it’s always better to have real data, that is key. It’s always important to have that. The more real data you have, the better your model’s going to perform in the long run. But if you don’t have real data, you need to synthesize it. And that’s where the synthetic data comes into play. So if you do have real data, it’s important to have that with the data set that you’re basically trying to train. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Last question … Oh, there’s even one more in the Q&A. They keep coming. So I want to share the preset with coworkers. Where can I find the video link? I’ll post it on our blog tomorrow, sometime in the afternoon but it’ll also be automatically sent to everyone who signed up for the Zoom webinar and on LinkedIn as well. Let’s see. Does Chooch work with all the major public cloud vendors, AWS, Azure, IBM, etc? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so currently we’re on AWS. And we’re looking into some of the others yet so that … The Dockerization of the entire system is important for us as a milestone. So once we have it Dockerized, you can basically take it anywhere. You don’t even have to contact us. It could work on private cloud, on prem and so forth. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, so let’s move to the chat here. First question is, is it a web service? And the answer is yes. If you go to Chooch.ai, go up to the upper right corner of the screen and sign up and you’ll see our web service right there. The second question, OpenVINO needs pre-trained models, correct? So perhaps your solution is more adequate for TensorFlow training. Does that make sense? Look at the chat. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. Okay. The backend of this is PyTorch, Balloon, TensorFlow, TensorRT for the compression and so forth. These deep learning frameworks, some of them perform better in different environments. So it’s always an ensemble on our system. But TensorFlow is definitely one of them. So we do use TensorFlow for some of the image classification. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Another question from the same attendee, your platform is only used to generate training data sets and annotations or do you put together object AI recognition applications too? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. That’s a good question. So our core is actually the inferencing. So the models arc is our core. These are only tools to beef up the data set in order to make the model better. So, that’s really what this is about. But the core is the model. So you just click create model, and you click the data set that you’ve generated and it’ll just generate that model, and then you can test the model on the same system. Jeffrey Goldsmith: And we’re almost done with the questions here and we’re 10 minutes before the top of the hour. Does your system handle domain adaptation? Domain adaptation. Do you see that question, Emrah? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, I don’t understand the question. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Matthew, could you rephrase that potentially, if you’re still on the call and we’ll answer that in a moment. How much accuracy increased going from 2D to 3D synthetic? Emrah Gultekin: So we can say, in general, depending on how much data you have, from real data manual data, which you might have 100 images of and then you create 2D let’s say with augmentation, 1000 images, you’re going from 50% accuracy to about 90% on average. But it really depends on the use case. From 2D to 3D, there’s no comparison because it’s a different thing. 3D synthetic data is very, very different. So we don’t have metrics on that. But from going from real data to any type of synthetic with augmentation, you’re basically reducing the accuracy by leaps and bounds. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, looks like this our last question. Usually, 2D image, object detection is feasible. What about 3D image object recognition? Where are we on that? Emrah Gultekin: We don’t do 3D object detection or recognition. It’s 2D. And the reason is because the market … All the sensors are 2D, all the cameras are … It’s an important question and we see a future on that. But the current market is all 2D. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. Well, thank you everyone for your questions. Oops, there’s one more. Hi, in my experience, that question about domain adaptation, isn’t it a sub discipline of machine learning which deals with scenarios in which a model train on a source distribution is used in the context of a different but related target distribution? Emrah Gultekin: Right, okay, so you’re talking about the domain in that sense? Yeah. If the domain is changing and you have … Let’s say the views are changing, the domain is changing, usually you need to tweak the model. And that’s part of the process of creating a dynamic user feedback for a grift. That’s really what this is about. So if you go back to the earlier slides where you’re getting new user feedback with annotated or with just raw images or video streams, with a change in domain, you’ve put that into shadow data sets which are checked by humans and checked by a machine. And then either you retrain the model, or you create a new model if the domain is very, very different. So there are few layers that are going on to trigger different models, depending on the scene and on the domain. Jeffrey Goldsmith: So second last question. If anybody has anything else, please post it now. So what kind of support do you have for transfer learning? Transfer- Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So the whole system is based on transfer learning actually, that’s how we’ve generated these models and these classifications as well. So it’s based on transfer learning from a base data set that we’ve trained initially, and we keep retraining that as well. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, great. Well, I think we are done here. Thanks for the talk. Can you share the recording with us? Absolutely, I can share the recording with you. It’ll be on the blog tomorrow. You’ll get notified by Zoom. Look for a link on the LinkedIn invite for the event and we’ll post it there. Emrah, thanks for the presentation. It was really well done. And thanks to the team for all your hard work putting together this technology. Please get in touch with us if you want any one on one support. And we’ll talk to y’all soon.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-definitions/,"Computer Vision Definitions | Chooch Learn more about computer vision and AI with this short list of top-level computer vision and AI terminology. Don’t know what AI training is? An AI model? Image recognition? What is an edge device? Find out from these quick computer vision definitions. Action recognition: A subfield of computer vision that seeks to identify when a person is performing an action, such as running, sleeping, or falling. AI API : An application programming interface (API) for users to gain access to artificial intelligence tools and functionality. By offering third-party AI services, AI APIs save developers from having to build their own AI in-house. AI computer : Any computer that can perform computations for artificial intelligence and machine learning, i.e. performing AI training and running AI models. Thanks to recent technological advances, even modest consumer-grade hardware is now capable of being an AI computer, equipped with a powerful CPU and GPU. AI demo : A demonstration of the features and capabilities of an AI platform, or of artificial intelligence in general. AI model : The result of training an AI algorithm, given the input data and settings (known as “hyperparameters”). An AI model is a distilled representation that attempts to encapsulate everything that the AI algorithm has learned during the training process. AI models can be shared and reused on new data for use in real-world environments. AI platform : A software library or framework for users to build, deploy, and manage applications that leverage artificial intelligence. AI platforms are less static and more extensive than AI APIs: whereas AI APIs return the results of a third-party pre-trained model, AI platforms allow users to create their own AI models for different purposes. AI training : The process of training one or more AI models. During the training process, AI models “learn” over time by looking at more and more input data. After making a prediction about a given input, the AI model discovers whether its prediction was correct; if it was incorrect, it adjusts its parameters to account for the error. Algorithm: A well-defined, step-by-step procedure that can be implemented by a computer. Algorithms must eventually terminate and are used to perform a particular task or provide the answer to a certain problem. Annotation: The process of labeling the input data in preparation for AI training. In computer vision , the input images and video must be annotated according to the task you want the AI model to perform. For example, if you want the model to perform image segmentation, the annotations must include the location and shape of each object in the image. Anomaly detection : A subfield of AI, machine learning , and data analysis that seeks to identify anomalies or outliers in a given dataset. Anomaly detection is applicable across a wide range of industries and use cases: for example, it can help discover instances of bank fraud or defects in manufacturing equipment. Artificial general intelligence (AGI): A type of artificial intelligence that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks as well as, or even better than, human beings. So far, attempts to build an AGI have been unsuccessful. Artificial intelligence (AI) : A field of computer science that seeks to bring intelligence to machines, usually by simulating human thought and action. AI enables computers to learn from experience and adjust to unseen inputs. Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) : The intersection of artificial intelligence with the Internet of Things: a vast, interconnected network of devices and sensors that communicate and exchange information via the Internet. Data collected by IoT devices is then processed by AI models. Common AIoT use cases include wearable technology and smart home devices. Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI): A type of artificial intelligence that, in contrast with an AGI, is designed to focus on a singular or limited task (e.g., playing chess or classifying photos of dog breeds). Artificial neural network (ANN): Also, just called a “neural network,” a machine learning model that consists of many interconnected artificial “neurons.” These neurons exchange information, roughly simulating the human brain. ANNs are the foundation of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning. Backpropagation: The main technique by which ANNs learn. In backpropagation, the weights of the connections between neurons are modified via gradient descent so that the network will give an output closer to the expected result. Bayesian network: A probabilistic model in the form of a graph that defines the conditional probability of different events (e.g., the probability of event A happening, given that event B does or does not happen). Big data: The use of datasets that are too large and/or complex to be analyzed by humans or traditional data processing methods. Big data may present challenges in terms of velocity (i.e., the speed at which it arrives) or veracity (i.e. maintaining high data quality). Chatbot: A computer program that uses natural language processing methods to conduct realistic conversations with human beings. Chatbots are frequently used in fields such as customer support (e.g., answering simple questions or processing item returns). Computer vision : A subfield of computer science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning that seeks to give computers a rapid, high-level understanding of images and videos, “seeing” them in the same way that human beings do. In recent years, computer vision has made great strides in accuracy and speed, thanks to deep learning and neural networks. Computer vision platform : An IT solution for building and deploying computer vision applications, bundling together a software development environment with a set of associated computer vision resources. Computer vision solution : A tool or platform that helps users integrate computer vision into their workflows, even without in-depth knowledge of computer vision or AI. Thanks to the wide range of applications for computer vision, from healthcare and retail to manufacturing and security, businesses of all sizes and industries are increasingly adopting computer vision solutions. Convolutional neural network (CNN): A special type of neural network that uses a mathematical operation known as a “convolution” to combine inputs (e.g., nearby pixels in an image). CNNs excel at higher-dimensional input such as images and videos. Data augmentation : A technique to increase the size of your datasets by making slight modifications to the existing images in the dataset. For example, you can rotate, flip, scale, crop, or shift an image in multiple ways to create dozens of augmented images. Incorporating augmented data can help the model learn to generalize better instead of overfitting to recognize the images themselves. Data collection : The process of accumulating large quantities of information for use in training an AI model. Data can be collected from proprietary sources (e.g. your own videos) or from publicly available datasets, such as the ImageNet database. Once collected, data must be annotated or tagged for use in AI training. Data mining: The use of automated techniques to uncover hidden patterns and insights in a dataset and make smarter data-driven predictions and forecasts. Data mining is widely used in fields such as marketing, finance, retail, and science. Deep learning: A subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple “hidden” (deep) layers. Thanks to both algorithmic improvements and technological advancements, recent years have seen deep learning successfully used to train AI models that can perform many advanced human-like tasks—from recognizing speech to identifying the contents of an image. D efect detection : A subfield of computer vision that seeks to identify defects, errors, anomalies, and issues with products or machinery. Dense classification: A method for training deep neural networks from only a few examples, first proposed in the 2019 academic paper “Dense Classification and Implanting for Few-Shot Learning” by Lifchitz et al. Broadly, dense classification encourages the network to look at all aspects of the object it seeks to identify, rather than focusing on only a few details. Digital ecosystem: An interconnected collection of IT resources (such as software applications, platforms, and hardware) owned by a given organization, acting as a unit to help the business accomplish its goals. Edge AI : The use of AI and machine learning algorithms running on edge devices to process data on local hardware, rather than uploading it to the cloud. Perhaps the greatest benefit of Edge AI is faster speeds (since data does not have to be sent to and from the cloud back and forth), enabling real-time decision-making. Edge device : An Internet-connected hardware device that is part of the Internet of Things (IoT) and acts as a gateway in the IoT network: on one hand, the local sensors and devices that collect data; on the other, the full capability of IoT in the cloud. For fastest results, many edge devices are capable of performing computations locally, rather than offloading this responsibility to the cloud. Edge platform : An IT software development environment that simplifies the process of deploying and maintaining edge devices. Ensemble learning: The use of predictions from multiple AI models trained on the same input (or samples of the same input) to reduce error and increase accuracy. Due to natural variability during the training phase, different models may return different results given the same data. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of all these models (e.g. by taking a majority vote) with the goal of improving performance. Event detection: A subfield of computer vision that analyzes visual data (i.e. images or videos) in order to detect when an event has occurred. Event detection has been applied successfully to use cases such as fall detection and smoke and fire detection. Facial authentication : A subfield of facial recognition that seeks to verify a person’s identity, usually for security purposes. Facial authentication is often performed on edge devices that are powerful enough to identify a subject almost instantaneously and with a high degree of accuracy. Facial recognition : The use of human faces as a biometric characteristic by examining various facial features (e.g. the distance and location of the eyes, nose, mouth, and cheekbones). Facial recognition is used both for facial authentication (identifying individual people with their consent) as well as in video surveillance systems that capture people’s images in public. Generative adversarial network (GAN): A type of neural network that attempts to learn through competition. One network, the “generator,” attempts to create realistic imitations of the training data (e.g., photos of human faces). The other network, the “discriminator,” attempts to separate the real examples from the fake ones. Genetic algorithm: A class of algorithms that takes inspiration from the evolutionary phenomenon of natural selection. Genetic algorithms start with a “pool” of possible solutions that evolve and mutate over time until reaching a stopping point. GPU: Short for “graphics processing unit,” a specialized hardware device used in computers, smartphones, and embedded systems originally built for real-time computer graphics rendering. However, the ability of GPUs to efficiently process many inputs in parallel has made them useful for a wide range of applications—including training AI models. Hash: The result of a mathematical function known as a “hash function” that converts arbitrary data into a unique (or nearly unique) numerical output. In facial authentication, for example, a complex hash function encodes the identifying characteristics of a user’s face and returns a numerical result. When a user attempts to access the system, their face is rehashed and compared with existing hashes to verify their identity. Image enrichment: The use of AI and machine learning to perform automatic “enrichment” of visual data, such as images and videos, by adding metadata (e.g. an image’s author, date of creation, or contents). In the media industry, for example, image enrichment is used to quickly and accurately tag online retail listings or new agency photos. Image quality control: The use of AI and machine learning to perform automatic quality control on visual data, such as images and videos. For example, image quality control tools can detect image defects such as blurriness, nudity, deepfakes, and banned content, and correct the issue or delete the image from the dataset. Image recognition : A subfield of AI and computer vision that seeks to recognize the contents of an image by describing them at a high level. For example, a trained image recognition model might be able to distinguish between images of dogs and images of cats. Image recognition is contrasted with image segmentation, which seeks to divide an image into multiple parts (e.g. the background and different objects). Image segmentation: A subfield of computer vision that seeks to divide an image into contiguous parts by associating each pixel with a certain category, such as the background or a foreground object. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) : The use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in industrial and manufacturing contexts. IIoT devices can be used to inspect industrial processes, detect flaws and defects in products and manufacturing equipment, promote workplace safety by detecting the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and much more. Inference: The use of a trained machine learning model to make predictions about a previously unseen dataset. In other words, the model infers the dataset’s contents using what it has learned from the training set. Internet of Things/IoT: A vast, interconnected network of devices and sensors that communicate and exchange information via the Internet. As one of the fastest-growing tech trends (with an estimated 127 new devices being connected every second), the IoT has the potential to transform industries such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, and more. JSON response: A response to an API request that uses the popular and lightweight JSON (JavaScript Open Notation) file format . A JSON response consists of a top-level array that contains one or more key-value pairs (e.g. { “name”: “John Smith”, “age”: 30 }). Labeling: The process of assigning a label that provides the correct context for each input in the training dataset, or the “answer” that you would like the AI model to return during training. In computer vision, there are two types of labeling: annotation and tagging. Labeling can be performed in-house or through outsourcing or crowdsourcing services. Liveness detection : A security feature for facial authentication systems to verify that a given image or video represents a live, authentic person, and not an attempt to fraudulently bypass the system (e.g. by wearing a mask of a person’s likeness, or by displaying a sleeping person’s face). Liveness detection is essential to guard against malicious actors. Machine learning : A subfield of AI and computer science that studies algorithms that can improve themselves over time by gaining more experience or viewing more data. Machine learning includes both supervised learning (in which the algorithm is given the expected results or labels) and unsupervised learning (in which the algorithm must find patterns in unlabeled data). Machine translation: The use of computers to automatically translate text from one natural (human) language to another, without assistance from a human translator. Machine vision: A subfield of AI and computer vision that combines hardware and software to enable machines to “see” at a high level as humans can. Machine vision is distinct from computer vision: a machine vision system consists of both a mechanical “body” that captures images and videos, as well as computer vision software that interprets these inputs. Metadata: Data that describes and provides information about other data. For visual data such as images and videos, metadata consists of three categories: technical (e.g. the camera type and settings), descriptive (e.g. the author, date of creation, title, contents, and keywords), and administrative (e.g. contact information and copyright). Motion tracking: A subfield of computer vision with the goal of following the motion of a person or object across multiple frames in a video. Natural language processing (NLP): A subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence with the goal of making computers understand, interpret, and generate human languages such as English. Near-edge AI : The deployment of AI systems on the “near edge,” i.e., computing infrastructure located between the point of data collection and remote servers in the cloud. Neural network: An AI and machine learning algorithm that seeks to mimic the high-level structure of a human brain. Neural networks have many interconnected artificial “neurons” arranged in multiple layers, each one storing a signal that it can transmit to other neurons. The use of larger neural networks with many hidden layers is known as deep learning. No-code AI: The use of a no-code platform to generate AI models without the need to write lines of computer code (or be familiar with computer programming at all). Object recognition : A subfield of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning that seeks to recognize and identify the most prominent objects (i.e., people or things) in a digital image or video. Optical character recognition (OCR): A technology that recognizes handwritten or printed text and converts it into digital characters. Overfitting: A performance issue with machine learning models in which the model learns to fit the training data too closely, including excessive detail and noise. This causes the model to perform poorly on unseen test data. Because overfitting is often caused by a lack of training data, techniques such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation can help alleviate it. Pattern recognition: The use of machine learning methods to automatically identify patterns (and anomalies) in a set of input data. Pre-trained model: An AI model that has already been trained on a set of input training data. Given an input, a pre-trained model can rapidly return its prediction on that input, without needing to train the model again. Pre-trained models can also be used for transfer learning, i.e. applying knowledge to a different but similar problem (for example, from recognizing car manufacturers to truck manufacturers). Presentation attack : An attempt to thwart biometric systems by spoofing the characteristics of a different person. With facial recognition software, for example, presentati on attacks may consist of printed photographs or 3D face masks presented to the camera by the attacker. Techniques such as liveness detection are necessary to avoid presentation attacks. Recurrent neural network (RNN): A special type of neural network that uses the output of the previous step as the input to the current step. RNNs are best suited for sequential and time-based data such as text and speech. Reinforcement learning: A subfield of AI and machine learning that teaches an AI model, using trial and error, how to behave in a complex environment in order to maximize its reward. Robotic process automation (RPA): A subfield of business process automation that uses software “robots” to automate manual repetitive tasks. Robotics: An interdisciplinary field combining engineering and computer science that seeks to build intelligent machines known as “robots,” which have bodies and can take actions inthe physical world. Segmentation: A subfield of AI and computer vision that seeks to divide an image or video into multiple parts (e.g. the background and different objects). For example, an image of a crowd of people might be segmented into the outlines of each individual person, as well as the image’s background. Image segmentation is widely used for applications such as healthcare (e.g. identifying cancerous cells in a medical image). Sentiment detection: A subfield of AI and computer vision that seeks to understand the tone of a given text. This may include determining whether a text has a positive, negative, or neutral opinion, or whether it contains a certain emotional state (e.g. “sad,” “angry,” or “happy”). Strong AI: A synonym for artificial general intelligence (AGI). “Strong AI” refers to a theoretical AI model that could duplicate or even surpass human capability across a wide spectrum of activities, serving as a machine “brain.” Structured data : Data that adheres to a known, predefined schema, making it easier to query and analyze. Examples of structured data include student records (with fields such as name, class year, GPA, etc.), and daily stock prices. Supervised learning: A subfield of machine learning that uses both input data and the expected output labels during the training process. In this way, the computer can easily identify and correct its mistakes. Synthetic data : Realistic but computer-generated image data that can be used to increase the size of your datasets during AI training. Using a 3D model and its associated texture, synthetic data (and the corresponding annotations or bounding boxes) can be generated with a wide variety of poses, viewpoints, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. Tagging: The process of labeling the input data with a single tag in preparation for AI training. Tagging is similar to annotation, but uses only a single label for each piece of input data. For example, if you want to perform image recognition for different dog breeds, your tags may be “golden retriever,” “bulldog,” etc. Transfer learning: A machine learning technique that reuses a model trained for one problem on a different but related problem, shortening the training process. For example, transfer learning could apply a model trained to recognize car makes and models to identify trucks instead. Turing test: A metric proposed by Alan Turing for assessing a machine’s “intelligence” by testing whether it can convince a human questioner that it is a person and not a computer. Unstructured data : Data that does not adhere to a predefined schema, making it more flexible but harder to analyze. Examples of unstructured data include text, images, and videos. Unsupervised learning: A subfield of machine learning that provides only input data, but not the expected output, during the training process. This requires the computer to identify hidden patterns and construct its own model of the data. Video analytics : The use of AI and computer vision to automatically analyze the contents of a video. This may include facial recognition, motion detection, and/or object detection. Video analytics is widely used in industries such as security, construction, retail, and healthcare, for applications from loss prevention to health and safety. Visual AI : The use of artificial intelligence to interpret visual data (i.e. images and videos), roughly synonymous with computer vision. Weak AI: A synonym for artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). “Weak AI” refers to an AI model that focuses on equaling or surpassing human performance on a particular task or set of tasks, with an intentionally limited scope.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/aiot-four-keys-to-edge-ai-iot-deployments/,"4 Keys to Edge AI and Internet of Things Deployments | Chooch Deploying IoT involves the installation of infrastructure, specific sensors, computers and cameras. However, to successfully deploy IoT this must also include real-time analytics, and introducing AI technologies into the mix creates AIoT. AI on the network edge detects and reports on events detected by sensors and results in four distinct benefits. Real Time Analytics Fully Deployed Intelligence Combining AI Technologies Completing the Lifecycle Real-Time Analytics Event stream processing analyzes different types of data and is able to successfully identify which data is relevant. To handle such data, event stream processing can: Identify important events and prompt the necessary action: Detection of all relevant events or events that are of some interest is possible through event stream processing. These include unusual activities during bank transactions or actions on mobile. Constantly monitor the information that is being gathered: Event stream processing can quickly detect any irregularities that can become potential problems. If such situations arise, smart devices can immediately alert the concerned operator and use corrective measures. Make sure that the sensor data is clean and authentic: You might find certain inconsistencies in the sensor data. This can be due to network errors or even dirty data. Data streams have techniques to check for discrepancies and troubleshoot if required. Improve operations in real-time: Optimization of operations in real-time is possible with advanced algorithms. For example, the arrival time of a train can be constantly updated, especially if there is a delay in any particular station. Using Intelligence Where the Application Requires It Data is constantly being generated by AIoT devices. Therefore analytics should be applied in different ways to get the best possible outcome. These different methods of deploying intelligence include: High-performance analytics: Heavy performance analytics can be deployed on data that is not moving or is in the storage. It can be also used when the data is in the cloud. Streaming analytics: When large amounts of moving data need to be analyzed for a few items of interest, streaming analytics should be used. Streaming analytics can also be used if the speed is critical and alerts for an imminent crash or component failure that needs to be sent. Edge computing: Edge computing immediately triggers necessary action on any data. It does not wait to ingest, store or move data anywhere without acting on it first. Combining AI Technologies A combination of AI technologies can provide many opportunities and the best outcome. For example, machine learning, language processing, and computer vision can happen simultaneously. Here’s an example/ Deep learning and computer vision can be used by clinics or hospitals for accurate radiographs, CT scans, and MRIs. To build patient profiles, detailing the family history of medical issues, natural language processing can be easily used along with computer vision to make the data far more accessible and accurate. Unifying the Complete Analytics Life Cycle To predict what will happen and to analyze what is happening in real-time, AI systems should have access to various kinds of data. If IoT is successfully implemented, the AI systems will be able to link all the following capabilities: Data analysis on the fly: This is event stream processing where large amounts of data are analyzed to find any relevant information. Real-time decision making: In case of data in motion or streaming data, if an event of interest occurs then immediately the necessary action should be triggered. Big data analytics: Large amounts of data can be ingested and processed when intelligence is obtained from IoT. This usually happens in a computing environment and running more iterations and using all of the data can also improve the precision of the model. Data management: Proper data management can clean and validate all kinds of data even when it is available in different formats. Analytical model management: Analytical model management is consistent and covers everything, from registration to retirement. The evolution of models can also be tracked and the performances are constantly improved. Ready to deploy AIoT? Chooch exports inference engines and installs computer vision on devices for Edge AI .

https://www.chooch.com/blog/visual-ai-railway-inspections-better-detection-of-railroad-defects-and-obstacles/,"Visual AI For Detecting Defects & Obstacles On Railways | Chooch Railway operators must conduct routine inspections and maintenance of tracks, trains, and other equipment to ensure the safe operation of railways. Through these inspection and maintenance activities, railway operators prevent service interruptions and, most importantly, reduce the chances of catastrophic railway accidents by resolving some of the most common causes of accidents, such as train and equipment failures, track defects, and other issues. While trains require more maintenance than any other piece of railroad infrastructure, tracks are also highly prone to causing breakdowns and delays when neglected. Ultimately, the successful completion of detailed visual inspections of trains, tracks, and other equipment is the first line of defense against neglected maintenance issues leading to accidents. Beyond routine maintenance inspections and repairs, train conductors and engineers help prevent accidents by constantly watching for obstacles – such as vehicles, rocks, trees, livestock, and people – on the tracks ahead. If train drivers detect these obstacles early enough, there’s a better chance of avoiding a disastrous accident. The latest computer vision technology offers railway operators tremendous ROI benefits in terms of earlier and more affordable detection of defects and obstacles . In fact, computer vision offers dramatic efficiency improvements over traditional methods of defect and obstacle detection. Traditional Methods of Railway Defect and Obstacle Detection Traditional methods for detecting rail- and train-related flaws and maintenance issues include visual inspection, ultrasound, liquid penetration inspection (LPI), radiography, and more. Visual inspections are particularly costly and inconvenient to perform, as they require teams of highly trained technicians to walk along tracks and trains to look for problems in need of repair. Railways also use cameras to assist with the inspection process. During rail and train inspections, human technicians must visually evaluate the condition of rails, ties, track ballast, mounting systems, train wheels, train undercarriages, and other details. Human errors and oversights abound in this process, and it’s not uncommon for inspectors to accidentally overlook a glaring maintenance concern that needs immediate repair to prevent train derailment or service shutdowns. As discussed in further detail below, railway operators incur massive costs when these defects go unnoticed. As for obstacle detection, conductors and engineers must rely on their keen eyesight and focus. Unfortunately, it usually doesn’t matter how early conductors can visually identify an obstacle. Trains typically cannot stop quickly enough to avoid a collision. The Challenges of Visual Defect and Obstacle Detection Despite spending millions of dollars each year to inspect North American railroads, railway inspection processes are fraught with problems and errors. This is mostly the result of: Staff shortages: Cost cuts and a lack of skilled inspectors mean that some railway operators may not have enough inspectors on hand to monitor all track assets with sufficient regularity and attention to detail. Poor management decisions surrounding inspections: Railway industry managers are prone to making mistakes when it comes to balancing the limited resources they can direct toward track inspection and maintenance. This can result in the neglect of track and train assets that need more attention and care. Inadequately performed inspections: Human railway inspectors are prone to missing details and making mistakes as a result of strict time constraints, distraction, fatigue, and the limitations of human capacity. A lack of regular inspections: Some railway operators must divert their limited inspection resources to key pieces of infrastructure. This can lead to infrequent or inadequate inspections of less essential sections of track. Human limitation: Train engineers are limited by how far ahead they can see. Plus, a curving track, trees, and buildings could obscure upcoming obstacles. This makes it difficult to detect livestock, people, and other obstacles early enough to stop the train to avert a collision. Train track suicides are also common. Tragically, many engineers remember the times they weren’t able to stop the train in time to prevent someone from dying. The Cost of Railway Inspection Errors and Train Accidents Failure to detect maintenance issues results in railroad operators finding out about problems too late – and the costs can be catastrophic. In these cases, an easily fixable defect can turn into a problem that’s expensive to repair or results in a serious accident. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration, human error, track failures, miscellaneous factors (such as collisions with obstacles, animals, and people), and equipment failures cause the majority of train accidents. Some of the costs associated with failing to detect railroad defects and obstacles include: Replacing and repairing train equipment and railroad tracks. Higher repair and maintenance costs. Personal injuries and wrongful death liabilities. Damage to goods and supplies the train was transporting. Lost customers and fewer sales from reputation damage and service delays. Environmental impact and cleanup of hazardous material spills. Psychological and emotional turmoil experienced by train drivers after witnessing a human death. Leveraging Visual AI for Better Railway Defect and Obstacle Detection Visual AI technology can offer a cost-effective and highly efficient solution for detecting defects and obstacles earlier, more accurately, and dramatically more affordably than railway operators can achieve with human inspectors and train engineers alone. Computer vision strategies for railroad defect and obstacle detection leverage the following features: High-definition cameras mounted on the undercarriages, fronts, and sides of railway cars and along railway tracks. Servers running sophisticated AI models that interpret visual data. Infrared and high-definition cameras that scan railway tracks for obstacles like animals, rocks, trees, people, vehicles, and debris. Instant reports and alerts sent to decision-makers who can immediately trigger a repair request for further investigation. Instant reports and alerts sent to train conductors and engineers who can slow down or stop trains as early as possible to prevent collisions. With Chooch AI computer vision technology, railway operators can rapidly train visual AI models to detect all types of visually perceivable defects and objects. In fact, Chooch AI can develop, train, and implement a custom visual AI strategy in only six to nine days. In this short amount of time, railway operators can start to realize the tremendous ROI benefits that come from faster, more accurate, and more affordable railway defect and obstacle detection. In summary, Chooch AI computer vision models for the railroad industry can help railway operators: Detect obstacles in the path of trains earlier than human engineers to provide additional time to prevent collisions and suicides. Visually detect maintenance issues on trains, wheels, and undercarriages. Visually identify track defects related to welds, cracks, and other maintenance issues. Evaluate the conditions of railway ties, track ballast, and mounting systems. Reduce train accidents and associated costs and damages. Reduce the cost of track, train, and equipment inspections. Reduce the cost of track, train, and equipment maintenance through earlier detection of defects and problems . Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

https://www.chooch.com/blog/training-computer-vision-ai-models-with-synthetic-data/,"Training Computer Vision AI Models With Synthetic Data | Chooch Powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning , computer vision can help digitally transform your business. Today, sophisticated computer vision AI models can learn to recognize a wide variety of faces, objects, concepts, and actions, just as well as—if not even better than—humans can. But… There’s just one problem: where are you going to get the data? For best results during AI training, you need to collect potentially hundreds or thousands of images or videos. The more training data you can obtain, the better your computer vision models can learn how to classify different visual phenomena. For example, suppose that you want to build a computer vision model that can differentiate between images of dogs and cats. If you only use high-quality photographs as your training data, with each animal close up and facing the camera, then your model might struggle to generalize to real-world situations, with types of data that it hasn’t seen before. Some difficulties with image recognition are: Different viewpoints: The subject may be photographed from many viewpoints, e.g. from behind, from below, from far away, etc. Different lighting conditions: The color and appearance of an object (e.g. an animal’s fur) may vary significantly, depending on the amount of light in the photograph. Variations within classes: Objects that are classified in the same category may still appear dissimilar—e.g. animals with wildly different colors, breeds, and appearances that are all classified as “dog” or “cat.” Occlusion: Computer vision models need to recognize objects that are partially hidden within the image. For example, the model can’t simply learn that all dogs appear to have four legs—or else it won’t recognize dogs inside blankets and dogs looking out a car window. In order to be responsive to these issues, your computer vision model needs to be trained on large amounts of labeled, high-quality, and highly diverse data. Unfortunately, generating this type of data manually can be difficult and time-consuming. Solving the Problem of Limited Data for Computer Vision One solution is to perform data augmentation: increasing the amount of training data by making slight modifications to each image. For example, an image of a dog may be slightly rotated, flipped, shifted, or cropped (or all of the above). This will help the model learn the underlying truth about what a dog looks like, rather than over-fitting by learning to recognize the image itself and knowing that “dog” is the right answer. A single image can produce a dozen or more augmented images that can help your computer vision model extrapolate better in real-world scenarios. Generating Synthetic Data for Computer Vision In addition to simple data augmentations, there’s another solution to the problem of data sparsity: you can generate synthetic data. If you have a realistic 3D model of the object you want to recognize, you can instantly generate hundreds or thousands of images of that 3D object with synthetic data generation . You can vary nearly everything about the object and image—viewpoints, pose, backgrounds, lighting conditions, etc.—so that your computer vision model gets a vastly greater range of realistic training data. You can automatically create bounding box annotations around the object’s position, rather than having to label each image yourself in a slow, manual process. If your 3D model is made up of many smaller parts (e.g. a lawnmower or other machinery), you can even generate data for object segmentation, so that the computer vision model learns to recognize each individual object part. By using synthetic data generation, computer vision users can rapidly build and iterate AI models and deploy them to the edge. Chooch is a computer vision vendor that helps businesses of all sizes and industries—from healthcare and construction to retail and geospatial —build cutting- edge computer vision models. Our synthetic data generation feature makes it easy for users to increase the diversity and versatility of their training data. All you need are two files: an .OBJ file that describes the object’s 3D geometry, and an .MTL file that describes the object’s appearance and textures.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-for-cell-identification-and-cell-counting/,"Computer Vision For Cell Identification And Counting | Chooch Counting and identifying cells is a tedious and time-consuming process. In many cases, highly paid Ph.D. scientists perform these tasks in the fields of histology, immunology, oncology, and pharmaceutical research. Unfortunately, the painstaking process involves long hours of looking at samples under a microscope and manually counting each cell – even worse, traditional cell counting methods leave a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy. Even the highest-trained scientists working under the best laboratory conditions rarely achieve better than 80% accuracy. Meanwhile, the time and labor costs required to complete these tasks represent a massive expenditure for laboratories. Interestingly, computer vision technology for cell counting offers a compelling solution to these inefficiencies. By leveraging an advanced visual AI platform like Chooch AI , labs can dramatically improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of cell counting activities. Many labs have boosted cell counting accuracy up to 98% – while reducing their skilled labor requirements. In this respect, computer vision for cell counting offers a clear ROI benefit compared to traditional methods. Traditional Methods of Cell Counting and Identification The hemocytometer still prevails as the most practical solution for the vast majority of cell counting use cases. This 19th-century tool consists of a slide with two gridded counting chambers. Scientists manually count the number of cells in the counting chambers to achieve a “workable” estimate of the concentration of cells. Samples generally require dilution, which can render less accurate results. The hemocytometer process is 80% accurate at best. This method is labor-intensive, and renders less than perfect results, but it’s adequate for many use cases. Another cell counting method involves the use of plating and Colony Forming Unit (CFU) counting. Scientists dilute a cell sample and plate the sample on a petri dish with a growth medium. From there, each cell grows into a colony of cells or CFU after at least 12 hours of growth. Next, scientists manually count each colony to determine the concentration of cells. This method is particularly useful when testing cell resistance to drugs. However, like the hemocytometer, this method is labor-intensive and monotonous, so fatigue and human counting errors are common. There are two more approaches to cell counting that render faster, more accurate results for many use cases. One involves the use of automated cell counters for cell and bacteria enumeration. The other involves the use of flow cytometer equipment. Unfortunately, these last two methods are so expensive that they’re only available to the most distinguished and well-funded research laboratories. Even for the facilities that can afford them, cell counters and flow cytometer equipment bring considerable operational costs and maintenance burdens. For these reasons, a recent study concluded: “In the low-resource-setting laboratories, standard hemocytometers are the only choice for quantification of cells and bacteria.” In this respect, there is a need for an affordable, automated, and accurate method for counting cells and bacteria that is more efficient than hemocytometers. Disadvantages of Manually Counting Cells The process of manually counting cells under a microscope comes with a number of disadvantages that, in most cases, laboratories have accepted as an inherent part of the process. These disadvantages include: Accuracy problems: Scientists can only achieve an 80% accuracy level under the best of circumstances when using a hemocytometer. Expensive labor: The average annual salary for a cell culture scientist in the United States is $85,042. Employing a team of scientists devoted to cell counting represents a significant cost for any research facility. Slow process: Scientists can take 30 minutes or longer to count the cells in a single hemocytometer slide. This brings a significant delay to any research or diagnostic activities that require cell counting, which slows down the completion of research, patient diagnoses, and the release of new medicines. Scientists prone to fatigue and distraction: The monotonous nature of manually counting cells fatigues scientists and hinders counting accuracy. Limitations of human perception: Human perception is limited in terms of the ability to perceive the difference between cells, cell debris, and other particles. In fact, it’s not uncommon for two scientists to give a significantly different result when counting the same sample. Highly diluted samples obscure results: Scientists need to dilute samples, which reduces the concentration of cells to make cell counting easier. However, this dilution process can interfere with the ability to produce statistically significant calculations. In other words, the sample could be diluted so much that counting produces inaccurate results. Leveraging Visual AI for Better Cell Counting Results Computer vision technology is perfectly suited to automate the task of manually identifying and counting cells. For example, the Chooch AI platform is capable of identifying and counting cells with dramatically more accurate results than its human counterparts – even compared to the results of Ph.D. scientists and experienced research physicians. The tremendous ROI benefits of computer vision technology for cell counting include: Faster cell counting results: Chooch AI completes 30-minute cell counting tasks in milliseconds, allowing the platform to achieve millions of human counting hours in just a few minutes. Improved accuracy: Chooch AI achieves 98% accuracy for most cell counting procedures. This is a striking improvement over the 80% standard for cell counting via traditional methods. Faster, better workflows: The speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency benefits of computer vision for cell counting allow laboratories to analyze higher volumes of samples faster and more affordably. Labor cost savings: Chooch AI brings tremendous labor cost savings while freeing skilled scientists and doctors to devote their time to more important tasks. More competitive drug research: With pharmaceutical companies racing to test and release new drugs as quickly as possible, the efficiency of visual AI helps drug companies bring new medicines to market in record time. Better patient outcomes: Computer vision speeds the process of conducting a complete blood count analysis, and accurately counting blood, plasma, and lymph cells. This empowers healthcare practitioners to achieve better patient outcomes by reducing instances of delayed diagnoses and misdiagnoses. Lower sample dilution requirement: Computer vision solutions for cell counting are capable of accurately counting the cells in less diluted samples. By reducing the level of dilution, scientists can achieve more accurate counting results. One of the primary advantages of Chooch AI is speed of implementation. With Chooch, laboratories can develop and deploy sophisticated computer vision models for cell counting in a matter of days. This is markedly faster than the six to nine months it generally takes to design and implement a visual AI model. Chooch AI offers research laboratories immediate access to a wide library of pre-built computer vision models for the most common cell counting use cases. For more unique scenarios, laboratories can add layers of training to existing models – or train entirely new models from scratch – depending on the needs of the use case. The ROI benefits of computer vision for cell counting are clear. With these new tools, medical labs diagnose patients faster and more accurately; drug companies develop new life-saving medications with greater efficiency; and, skilled scientists and doctors have extra time to devote to more pressing tasks.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/leveraging-ai-for-better-patient-monitoring/,"Leveraging AI for Better Patient Monitoring | Chooch Healthcare facilities throughout the world are suffering from critical staff shortages, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made the situation worse. According to November 2020 statistics from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 18% of U.S. hospitals said that they were critically short on medical staff. Patient monitoring AI can dramatically improve the ability of hospitals and medical facilities to monitor situations. Staffing shortages have made it difficult for hospitals to provide sufficient monitoring of patients who require immediate attention. Tragically, a wide range of patient behaviors – like sitting up, getting out of bed, coughing, falling, or gesturing for help – go unnoticed until it’s too late to help the patient in need. Patient monitoring AI can be life saving in these situations. The Tragic Cost of Patient Monitoring Failures Diligent visual monitoring of patients is key to ensuring the best medical outcomes, but even a fully staffed hospital or medical facility can’t keep an eye on everything. Here are some examples of the tragic cost of patient monitoring failures: Falls Medical patients in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health facilities are more prone to fall injuries. For example, PSNet reports that medical patients fall approximately 3 to 5 times per 1,000 bed-days . The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that an estimated 700,000 to 1 million hospital patients fall every year. Moreover, approximately 50% of the 1.6 million U.S. nursing home residents fall every year. Sadly, over 33% of hospital patient falls result in an injury – and many of these injuries are serious, involving fractures and head trauma. Beyond the injuries, hospital patient falls may be classified as “ never events, ” which means that the Centers for Medical and Medicaid Services will not reimburse hospitals for the additional medical costs related to the falls, representing a significant financial burden on the hospital. Considering the risk of fall injuries at medical facilities, medical staff need to know whenever an at-risk patient gets out of bed or suffers a fall. However, it’s impossible to constantly monitor all patients at all times. Considering that medical facilities are usually short on staff, it’s not uncommon for a fallen patient to be left unattended, which can lead to devastating health consequences. Coughing, Hand Gestures, and Spasms Patients suffering from coughing fits – or various types of hand gestures and bodily spasms – could be in dire need of assistance to ensure that they are breathing properly and not experiencing a health emergency. Any delay in detecting a patient in this kind of situation could result in a worsened health condition or death. In many cases, health facilities can be held liable for their patient monitoring failures – especially if those failures are the result of negligence and result in serious injuries or death. Aside from the tragic health consequences and negative impact on patient families, monitoring failures damage the reputations of medical facilities, increase liabilities, and elevate insurance costs. Leveraging Visual AI for Better Patient Monitoring Patient monitoring AI technologies can dramatically improve the ability of hospitals and medical facilities to detect instances of patients falling, in addition to monitoring patient behaviors and gestures. A trained computer vision system for patient monitoring can easily detect the following patient gestures, movements, and behaviors: A hospital patient, ICU patient, post-op patient, or visitor who falls down. A patient who swings his or her legs over the side of a bed in preparation to get up. A patient who suddenly sits up in bed. A patient who is suffering from a coughing fit, sneezing fit, or body spasms. A patient who is gesturing his or her arms for help. A patient with a bloody nose after reacting badly to a drug protocol. At Chooch AI, we can train sophisticated computer vision models to detect all of the above and more. Deployable through the cloud – or on edge devices for maximum security and privacy – these devices can use an existing IoT camera network to gather and interpret visual data on patient and hospital visitor activities. Chooch can also install a visual AI system for patient monitoring on a rollable cart that includes (1) a monitoring camera on the top and (2) a visual AI edge server on the bottom. Medical staff can position these carts in rooms to monitor patient behavior and provide immediate updates and alerts as required. Any hospital or medical facility can develop and deploy visual AI strategies like these, and start achieving better patient outcomes in a matter of days. In summary, Chooch AI computer vision models for patient monitoring AI can help hospitals and medical facilities: Monitor patient conditions with greater accuracy and attention to detail. Instantly respond to patient emergencies as soon as a problem arises. More immediately help patients who are experiencing adverse reactions to drugs. Receive instant alerts when a patient or anyone in the hospital falls. Detect unusual patient behaviors such as a patient getting ready to exit his or her bed, coughing, sneezing, or gesturing for help.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/ai-model-deployments-for-edge-ai-with-the-chooch-ai-platform/,"AI Model Deployments for Edge AI with Chooch AI Platform | Chooch In this 15 minute presentation, Emrah Gultekin, CEO of Chooch AI, presents how the Chooch AI platform ingests visual data, trains the AI, and exports AI models to the edge. This allows scalable inferencing on the edge on any number of devices from any number of cameras. A transcript of the presentation is provided below the video. Hi, everybody. So today we’re going to be talking a little bit about Edge AI and how that is performed, so let me go ahead and share my screen. So mass deployment of AI models on the Edge, that’s what this is about today. Basically, what we do here at Chooch is there are three components that make up the entire system, and one is the dashboard, and that’s the cloud account that you have. And that’s really crucial because that’s where you create the account, that’s where you select your pre-trained models, you can actually train new models on the account, you can add devices, and so forth. So that’s one part of it. The next part is the device itself on the Edge , which is usually an NVIDIA device. And then the third component is the camera, so any type of imaging that’s coming in. So the camera’s associated with the device and that’s where the inferences are done, and you’re able to manage all that on premise and on the Cloud. So here’s an example of what the output looks like on any of these devices and cameras that you have, so safety vests, hard hats, and whatever you basically train it for. And so these are outputs that are saved on the device, and you can create alerts, or you can create SMS messages or email messages, depending on your use case. And you could aggregate all this information and generate the reports as well. So if we look at AI as a whole, in terms of the different areas and the different types of things that you need to do to make it work properly, we’re looking at three main areas, and that’s dataset generation, which is the first bit of it, that’s the most crucial part of it in terms of starting out. And then the second part is training, over here. So that’s where you create the models. And then inferencing, and that’s when you have new predictions coming in, so you have new data coming in and it generates inferences which are predictions of what it sees. So this is like the cycle of it, and then the inferencing goes back into dataset generation as well. So if you have new types of information coming in, new types of data or video streams, it’s important to feed it back into dataset generation to refine the model and also update it, or basically, maybe train new classes or new models as well. So the device is really crucial here because that’s where it is on the Edge , and you have a device and a camera that looks at the area, and then it does inferencing. So what’s important here is to be able to put all these streams onto the devices. And the reason is the network load is very low, there is no network load on the device, obviously, so you don’t have to send anything to the Cloud. The second issue is privacy, everything stays on the device. And a third is speed, it’s two milliseconds per inference. So it’s far faster than anything that you’re going to do on the Cloud. We have many, many devices and many models, and you can manage these devices and the models from your dashboard. And then the camera is associated with the device. So you create a device, and then you add cameras to it, and you can add multiple streams to any of these NVIDIA devices. So let’s start with dataset generation AI training. That’s really, really crucial over here, just how we do it. So on the dashboard, what you do is you first, it depends what you’re doing, so it’s facial image or object. Object is the most complex, so we start with that. Here, you create a dataset. Let’s do that. So it’ll ask you to upload images or videos, so you can upload images or videos to create your dataset, and it asks you if you want to do bounding box or polygon annotation. Annotation is a way to label what’s inside of that image or inside of that video. So we’ll go into some examples for that as well. Here’s let’s say a raw image of what you want to train. And what you start doing is basically doing bounding boxes. And if it’s polygon, then you would do segmentation. Here you would do it, and name what you’re looking at, so it could be “hardhat”, it could’ve been “red hardhat” and then security Avast and so forth. So you basically do this manually. If it’s an unknown object in the dataset, it’ll start giving you these. So you upload these, you annotate them manually. If it’s something new, you have to do it manually. If it’s a known object that the system already knows, it provides you with suggestions, so it creates a dataset. And here you are, 141 images of a hard hat and 74 security Avast. So this would be the raw images, so you would have raw annotations here. And then what happens in the back is this would be augmented by about x18 images in order to enrich the dataset. So it changes it, augments it in the backend. Here you then create a perception. So you go back and you say, “Hey, We have the dataset, now let’s create the perception,” which is the model. And you name your perception, then you select the dataset, you can reuse these datasets obviously, for different types of models that you’re building. And then it starts training it. And then you can see the log of what’s going on. And then it’s actually trained. And here, you can do a test via upload and test your new perception, your new model, and then basically provide feedback to the model. And it’ll generate also an F1 score with it. Here, you can see the JSON response, so this is the raw JSON with the class title and the coordinates of what you’re looking at, what it predicts. And here’s the F1 score. This is an accuracy score. So the model generates automatically the accuracy of those particular classes. But that’s not enough, because what you need to do is go back and check it as a human. And this is done manually, pre deployment usually, or after deployment sometimes it’s done as well. And what you want to do is you want to be able to have an F1 score which is above 90%. And that’s what this is about. You’re able to download this and actually test many images of it. So device deployment and camera management, this is also crucial. So let’s say you’re using a pre-trained model or pre-trained perception, or you’ve kind of trained your own thing. You want to deploy these onto the Edge so that the inferencing is done on the edge. And here you have the device that you want to generate, so you go onto other devices, you create the device, this is office device, device for whatever office here, and it’ll create the device, right? It’ll have a device ID on it. And then what you want to do is you want to add cameras to it, right? So you have your Jetson line or your T4, and then you want to add a camera to it, or cameras, multiple cameras. You add the camera, name it, the RTSP feed as well, and then you select your perceptions that you want to put onto this device. So let’s say it’s the hard hat one, or whatever, fall detection . You add these to the device, and you could see that here, it’s added to the device, and boom, it starts working. So what we’re really doing here is training on the Cloud and then deploying the model onto the Edge, pre-trained as well, or you want to deploy something that you’ve trained, it doesn’t really matter. But you’re able to push it out onto the device. And the device actually syncs up with your Cloud account anytime it has connectivity. You can use it without connectivity, obviously, but you can use it with connectivity as well, and it’ll sync automatically if you want it to sync automatically with the Cloud account, if you’ve trained, retrained, a model, or you’ve done something new, or just basic system updates that you might have. So this is an example of masks and no masks. This is an example of social distancing. So you could put all these onto the Edge so that they work exclusively. So basically, what happens with the Edge is you don’t stream anything to the Cloud and in doing so it works 24/7 without any type of burden to the network. And it’s also very, very expensive to do that on the Cloud. This is people counting. This is fall detection . These are examples of anything that you want to train, or you want to use anything that’s pre-trained, you’re able to do that. Fire detection. And you’re able to select the pre-trained and deploy them immediately, if you want to use any of the pre-trained stuff. But you might have a use case where you want something specific and you would work with us so that that becomes trained. And we do the training very, very quickly, depending on the data that our clients provide. So here you have many, many devices, and you can manage all these devices and all the models on them remotely, and it does the inferencing on those devices. So, thank you. If you have any questions about Edge AI , please out to us, [email protected] , and we look forward to keep working with with the ecosystem. Thank you. So what’s crucial here is to be able to deploy these models and perceptions on the Edge, on multiple devices and through multiple cameras. And that’s what this is really about. And to be able to manage those at scale. So to be able to do that, we built the system which is the dashboard where you have your models, and where you have your devices, and where you manage those devices and cameras. And then physically, you need to have these cameras hooked up to the devices, whether any of the Jetsons or on-prem, such as the T4s, and to be able to manage these and to be able to update these at one time. So to be able to train something new, deploy it on multiple devices, scale it, and also to be able to retrain it and to have them synced. So AI is not about static models. It’s about dynamic models, and also dynamic situations where you have these different devices out there with different types of camera angles, different types of cameras, and so forth. So be able to do this at scale and to be able to manage all of it, and that’s what we’ve done as a company is to provide you with the Chooch AI platform in order to deploy these very, very quickly, you’re able to do the Docker, download the Docker, set up in two and a half, three minutes, and then basically scale it out depending on what your use case might be. So it’s really important that we recognize what this is all about. This is all about efficiency, and to be able to do these at scale, and to be able to do it very quickly. And that’s what we’ve done as a company. Thank you for listening to this. This is all about the Edge, being able to do the inferencing on the Edge, being able to deploy these models, deploy these devices on the Edge, and to be able to provide that type of inferencing and that type of data. And we look forward to continue working with the ecosystem here. Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing? AI Definitions What is Computer Vision?

https://www.chooch.com/blog/visual-ai-for-digital-asset-management-dam/,"Visual AI for Digital Asset Management (DAM) | Chooch The use of Digital Asset Management (DAM) software is vital for any organization managing large terabytes of visual media. Despite the usefulness of this highly sophisticated software, teams of human workers are still required to annotate, index, timestamp, and control the quality of assets like photographs and video. Not only is the process costly and time-consuming, but it’s also fraught with errors and inadequacies. Now, media companies and retailers are achieving dramatic ROI benefits by adopting computer vision strategies to fully automate these time-consuming annotation and indexing tasks. Why Is DAM Important? Many enterprises — especially media companies — are managing millions of images and billions of seconds of video. The more these companies understand media in their archives, the faster they can find “XYZ,” as soon as the need arises. Also, by implementing quality control standards, retailers can better align images and video with their marketing and branding standards. Unfortunately, most companies don’t fully know what’s available in their DAM archives and they can’t control the quality of their visual data. This is not because they don’t see the value of better DAM. It’s because of the enormous cost, time — and in many cases impossibility — of employing human workers to accurately annotate and control the quality of their vast reserves of data Leveraging Visual AI for More Efficient Digital Media Management An advanced computer vision solution can fully automate the process of analyzing and annotating both photographs and video through “smart annotation.” Even if the annotation process requires highly skilled and experienced professionals — such as an expert on celebrities or clothing styles — a Chooch AI strategy can achieve the job with greater accuracy, speed, and affordability. Case Study Example 1: A Television Station Needs to Annotate a Vast Media Archive At Chooch AI, we develop agile, powerful, and highly affordable computer vision strategies for the widest range of use cases. Recently, one of our partners connected us with a television station managing a video reel archive consisting of millions of seconds of recorded content. Periodically, the station needs to locate a small clip of a celebrity for an advertising spot. For example, they might need to find some video of Emeril Lagasse inside their vast library of recorded video data to include in a 30-second preview of an upcoming show. Unfortunately, most of their video is completely un-indexed, so employees could spend a month scanning through content just to find the clip they need. Multiply this task by 100 for a large media company, and you can start to understand how time-consuming and expensive the process can be. With a DAM computer vision strategy from Chooch AI , the television station implemented a ready-made visual AI model that recognizes over 400 celebrity faces. Using this system, the station was able to instantly index and timestamp all of their video archives according to where different celebrities were found — a process that would have taken a team of human workers years to complete. Case Study Example 2: An Online Used Car Retailer Needs to Implement Photograph Quality Control Standards In another case, an online auto reseller contacted Chooch AI to develop a strategy that would enforce quality control standards on dealer-submitted images. The retailer found that dealer-submitted listings were more successful when they featured clear, well-framed photos with all three tires visible. They also found that distracting objects in the shots — like trash or half-empty water bottles — were damaging to sales. Despite clear guidelines for photo submission, the auto reseller dealers were submitting poor-quality photos, and they did not have enough human photo inspectors to implement strict quality control standards. With a computer vision system from Chooch AI , the auto reseller was able to implement pre-trained visual AI models for quality control purposes. These models recognize problems related to trash, bottles, framing, blurriness, and brightness — automating the process of disqualifying images based on these criteria. This has dramatically boosted sales on the platform by improving the quality and effectiveness of images. Final Thoughts on Computer Vision for DAM Among the efficiency and accuracy benefits of Chooch AI , one of the most impressive characteristics of the platform is speed of implementation. Digital media managers can quickly train AI models to analyze and annotate visual media data based on nearly any criteria. In fact, Chooch AI users can design, develop, and deploy an entirely unique computer vision strategy in just 6 to 9 days. In this short amount of time, you can start to reap tremendous ROI benefits by eliminating the endless hours of monotonous and expensive human labor required to index and find the clips and photographs you need.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/computer-vision-solutions-enterprise-ai-applications-in-six-industries/,"6 Computer Vision AI Enterprise Applications | Chooch As computer vision is becoming increasingly sophisticated, it brings business benefits to a wide variety of industries. From defect detection to loss prevention, computer vision is a powerful tool with the potential to improve processes and results in many contexts. But before we dive into the use cases of computer vision, let’s define what it is. What is computer vision? Computer vision is often confused with Artificial Intelligence (AI) , but it is not quite the same thing. Computer vision is the ability of computers to “see”, analyze and understand images or videos. AI, on the other hand, is when computers perform tasks that usually would require human intelligence. Simply put, computer vision is the “human eyes” of the computer, while AI is the “human brain.” One could also say that computer vision is AI applied to the visual world. Visual data that computer vision can process include images and videos captured by cameras, 3D scanners, and medical scanners. Today, computer vision is sophisticated enough to outperform the human eye. In this article, we’ll look at the business applications of computer vision solutions and how they can improve safety and efficiency – while lowering costs – in 6 different industries. 1. Retail Computer vision optimizes processes and improves the customer experience, both in brick and mortar stores and online. Improved operations and reduced costs: Computer vision allows retailers to speed up processes such as inventory management, payments, and compliance. Automated planogram analysis can save time, reduce space wastage and suggest the most optimal shelf placement for each product. Increased security and reduced shrinkage: Shoplifting and employee theft are costing retailers a staggering $100 billion globally every year. Computer vision can spot suspicious activities and provide heat maps of shoppers moving around the store – real-time data that helps ensure health and safety. Improved customer experience: Computer vision can improve in-store marketing in several ways. Facial recognition enables retailers to identify regular customers and provide personalized service. Coupons and offers can be personalized, and products can be suggested based on previous purchases. Learn more about Chooch’s Retail AI solutions . 2. Healthcare Computer vision helps medical professionals save time and optimize workflows. A growing number of doctors are using it to diagnose their patients and prescribe the right treatments. Increased patient safety: Computer vision improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing the number of unnecessary procedures and expensive therapies. It can detect illnesses that can otherwise be difficult to identify, such as neurological illnesses . Increased accuracy and quicker diagnosis mean lower costs, both for the patient and the care provider. Facial authentication prevents misidentification of patients and increases the security of medical facilities. Increased operational efficiency: Doctors traditionally spend a lot of their time analyzing images and reports. Computer vision frees up their time so that they can spend it with patients instead. This means quicker care at a lower cost . Computer vision can also be used to monitor operating room procedures and provide automatic surgical logs. When activities such as anesthetization, chest closure, and instrument usage are logged, it reduces errors and increases efficiency. Medical imaging and measuring blood loss: Computer vision is used in medical imaging, where a recent example is the detection of COVID-19 in lung X-ray images with 98% accuracy . The Orlando Health Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies uses computer vision to measure blood loss during childbirth. Before, it was impossible to know how much blood a mother was loosing. But with computer vision, images of surgical sponges and suction canisters can be used to measure blood loss. Contact us about healthcare AI 3.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/ai-for-good-emrah-gultekin-on-880thebiz-radio/,"AI for Good: Emrah Gultekin on 880TheBiz Radio | Chooch Listen on Spotify “We’re gonna go pro-AI now. And, when we think about it, you know, we’ve been talking about all the status security, erasing the data, but what happens when your car is stolen, your child is kidnapped. Now, all of a sudden, artificial intelligence comes in handy. Right? It’s a catch 22, it’s a yin and yang of the world that we’re gonna have to figure out. We’re lucky we have Emrah on the phone with us right now. He’s the co-founder and CEO of Chooch Technologies and let me give you a quick synapsis before he’s on to explain it himself. This is computer vision that processes any visual data — microscopic to satellite, the CCTVs to medical imaging, drones, etc. And we’re really lucky to have him. I know he’s a really busy guy so let’s get right to it.” Corey Morgan: Hey Emrah, it’s Corey Morgan, co-host, how are you tonight? Emrah: Good. Good. How are you guys? Johnny Irish: Good. Good. Corey Morgan: Yeah, we’re literally having such a good conversation but it really has on being, you know, on the protection side of all this. And, uh, on the flip side, you’re gonna come in and say, “You know what, this is gonna change our world and it’s for the best.” So, please tell us what’s going on in your world and how you got involved with this really quickly. Emrah: Yeah, so privacy is definitely a concern and we’ve been talking about this for many, many years now and it keeps us up at night. But the fact is, AI is becoming part of our lives as we move forward. And when we do this Chooch AI, we’re a computer vision company . So what we do is we clone human-built intelligence into machines. So if you’re a biomedical expert and you’re looking at cells all day and counting them and trying to identify them. What we do is we take their capability of doing that and we put it into machines so we don’t have to do it anymore. And then we proliferate it so one person becomes, you know, a thousand or a million. We can basically proliferate it to infinity. And, similarly, with other things like aircraft engine parts. Basically, anything visual that humans do today, we can take and we can put into a machine. So that the machine tags the same way that a human would. So basically, this is what we’re doing. It’s real AI and we work with some of the major themes, either spacial or healthcare . We’re doing a lot of security and safety as well. Johnny Irish: So how would that work, like, say to combat wildfires? AI Detection of Wildfires Emrah: That’s one of our projects, actually. So today, wildfires are detected by humans. Basically, okay there seems to be fire somewhere and they see some smoke and it’s too late by that time, usually. So what we’re doing is we’re processing 30 million images every 15 minutes from satellites and drones so that we can send back that information to first responders and send them email alerts or text alerts. So, humanly impossible to do, you’d need thousands and thousands of people looking at this imagery to detect wildfires from space . And that’s basically what we’re doing to one of our major projects that we’ve been doing since 2018. Johnny Irish: Alright, you also mentioned healthcare . You know sometimes I feel like our audience are, you know, just the general public and doesn’t really know what’s going on behind the scenes. So it’s healthcare, it’s wildfires. What are the main AI technologies currently being developed to make us safer and help us move on a daily basis throughout our lives that we might not know about? Emrah: Yeah, so it’s really early in AI development to be perfectly straight-forward. It’s sort of akin to internet in 1993-1994. It’s just starting and you can browse two things but nothing substantial as it is today. AI is the same way. It’s very, very early. A lot of these components don’t work out of the box. So it’s not like, “Oh, AI is here.” It’s a new computational tool, basically, and it’s kind of horizontal today. So you take computer vision , for example, it’s kind of horizontal across verticals. And then, you also have other things like NLU, NLP which is Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding. And then, you have audio as well. You have speech. These are things that are being developed across as vertical as horizontally. And what we’re seeing is, you know, we’re seeing incremental increase in these. I think what we’re doing is this will be 20 to 30 years in development. And we’ll see it basically come into our lives very, very quickly in many different fields. We’re seeing it today in, for example, the home pods like Alexa and Google and whatever. We’re seeing it in self-driving cars. We’re seeing across some enterprise as well. So it’s not very consumer-y right now. And that’s why people, I think, are very confused about this. It’s more enterprise-y. And it’s across enterprises, their back ends using this technology to do better data analytics, data crunching across those different verticals. Johnny Irish: Uh, real quick here. Let’s just take a step backwards. Just a little one on one before we jump into some of the details. What is artificial intelligence exactly, and how does it differ from, like, machine learning ? Emrah: Great question. So, artificial intelligence is the entirety of a new computational method. Machine learning is one of the methods underneath artificial intelligence. So artificial intelligence is, it encompasses the entire gamut of this new computational method but machine learning is part of it. So if you’re talking technically, yes machine learning is the best way to talk about it. There are two components to machine learning: one is training, so you need to train an AI; and then, the second component are the predictions that are called inferencing . So if you don’t train the AI, you don’t get any inferencing predictions. So machine learning , it kinda branched out into two things there. To train it, you need to provide labeled images. And that’s what we do with Chooch AI , we provide, we labeled images saying, “Okay, this is a certain type of cell, or this is a certain type of acid on the ground.” And then, the AI learns it and when it receives new information, it can tag those things. Johnny Irish: Okay. Emrah: That’s really what AI is about today. It’s a regression tool. It’s not really artificial intelligence. That’s kind of a misnomer. Johnny Irish: Mhhm. Emrah: It’s a new computational tool. I wish they would have called it that because artificial intelligence gets people kind of edgy. Johnny Irish: Yeah, it’s like does artificial intelligence even exist? Corey Morgan: When you say artificial intelligence, I think Terminator, you know, literally. Emrah: Yeah, and that’s not where we are and I don’t think we’re gonna go there at all. Johnny Irish: Yeah, Skynet you know. *laughs* Emrah: Yeah, yeah. It’s a new computational tool and the computation is stronger than old computational tools which are like, you know, normal algorithms. What this does is, it does multiple algorithms in a linear regression so it can make predictions on certain things. And the prediction is just a tag, but it’s just a computation. It’s a computer.          And so, personally we’re practitioners in AI and we’re saying there’s nothing to be afraid of here at this stage because this is just a new way of computing and, actually, we have no choice. It’s like rejecting electricity or rejecting a car, like, “I’m not gonna drive a car.” Johnny Irish: Yeah, right. And that happened back in the day, by the way folks. *laughs* Emrah: Yeah. Yeah. Johnny Irish: People were against electricity. I mean, people are against cars and they wanted to keep the horse and buggy. Corey Morgan: Yeah, and to be honest with you, it’s like rejecting the internet, as you said, in ’93, ’94. Johnny Irish: Exactly. Emrah: Yeah, it is. We have no choice as humans, as, like, in this community, this country, the world. Because if we don’t take this on, like, there’s competition. This is all about efficiency, and if we don’t become more efficient, others will. And we’ll lose. Johnny Irish: And when you say that, you’re not talking about corporations. You’re talking about continents and countries. Corey Morgan: We’re trying to be the AI superpower. A lot of people think they are and they’re gonna take our technology and move on. Emrah: Exactly. It’s between countries. It’s between communities. It’s between organizations, companies. Companies, especially, they need to be much more efficient. Johnny Irish: Mhhm. Emrah: Those who become efficient will take over the market. And that’s why you see this race with self-driving cars. Right? Johnny Irish: Mhmm. Emrah: Where you have, like, people pouring billions into self-driving because the moment you have a self-driving car, you’ve taken over that market and you’ve taken over the entire market as well. Johnny Irish: Yeah, so we have touched on this and, not to take you off topic, we have touched on this a couple of shows ago regarding the self-driving cars and the technology, the infrastructure on the actual highways where the cars can talk to each other, you know, like, “this car just switched lanes.” It becomes much more than the car, in my opinion, it becomes the environment that the car is driving in. And that has to be “smart”, for lack of a better word, as well. Like a smart highway. Am I wrong in that? Emrah: It’s correct. So what we’re doing on the self-driving car, part of this, a lot of this is usually AI as well. So remember, you have to teach the car what’s allowed. What do the pedestrian look like? What’s the “Stop” sign? What’s a tree? Is it a rabbit or is it a cat? I mean, it may not make a difference, but the more detail you have, the better it can discern between things. Smarter Cars with AI So these cars that you see, they’re collecting information, visual data. And that visual data are annotated, labeled, and it goes into a training system. And then the training system goes back and it’s deployed into the cars. So it’s like this circular thing. And right, the highways need to be smarter but it’s really the cars that need to be a lot smarter and need to be talking to each other. And that, that exists today. The science of that exists. The problem is, how do you get that to the engineering? And then, how do you make a product out of it and how do you distribute it? Johnny Irish: Yeah. Emrah: So the science of this had existed for about 34 years but it’s nothing near. But how do you really deploy it? How do you engineer it and then you create a product? Johnny Irish: Yeah. How do we perfect it at this point? Emrah: Exactly. Exactly. Johnny Irish: You know, one thing we’ve been, you know, and this is how, why we were introduced. And the point of tonight’s show and the individual segments is, we came into this as, you know, everyone’s collecting our data and how do we do. But, one thing that we had a discussion, you know, Matt and I, my board up here, we were just talking about it and we mentioned it on the earlier segment is in regards to Alexa. Even though she’s listening to you, she’s not listening because it’s an evil thing. She’s listening because she need to learn those words. It’s more educational for her than data sharing. Am I correct with that? Emrah: It is. It is. And unfortunately, we have this stigma against AI because we called AI and that’s not what’s happening here. Of course what happens is, it’s a very powerful tool, right? And so what people are really afraid of here is some people having access to it and others don’t. So it’s kinda like the “have” and the “have not”, and the have’s trying to take over the world and do evil things. And what we really need to do is create equality on the availability of AI to everybody. And that you need some sort of checks and balances there so that okay I have this tool but okay my neighbor also has it. Johnny Irish: Yeah. Emrah: There’s a certain check there. And I think that, honestly, it’s totally, totally for efficiency. We are highly inefficient right now. We need to become more efficient, which means creating more welfare. It creates more welfare for everybody. Johnny Irish: Mhhm. Emrah: I’ll go back to this thing where London has 500,000 CCTVs. Johnny Irish: Yeah. Yeah. Emrah: 500,000 cameras. New York has 9000. I’m like, “Why did that happen?” Well, it’s because of the IRA. Safety with Facial Authentication Johnny Irish: Ugh. You’ve read my mind. You’ve read my mind. Emrah: Right. And they go, “Hey listen, I’m gonna put up these cameras.” They put up the cameras, the bombing stopped. I’d rather have a camera than a bomb in my neighborhood. That’s really the reality here. And whether they are viewing us, or, like, listening that’s a different case but I think, those types of stories we need to put out there so that people feel safer and adapt. Johnny Irish: Yeah, I don’t really want to get into the CCTV thing because that where we’ll get into facial recognition and that brings us back on the negative side, too much information and lack of privacy. But on the pro side, and this is my opinion and what I would see would be valuable for the world and our country and municipalities. When you have the likes of a Tesla, doing what they’re doing. Now, everyone else is trying to catch up – Ford, Hyundai. I think that information, even though these companies are competing with each other for consumer, for self-driving car, or that I can park itself, or, you know, it’s gonna automatically slow down. I think, all that data that it collects should be open source because, guess what, we just collected all that data and it’s good for the consumers so Ford can use it too, you know? Emrah: Yeah, and a lot of these companies are doing that. So you have OpenAI, for example, and that is like a consolidation of all these different tools and information and data that people collect from different companies and Tesla’s actually a part of it. At Chooch, we’re also opening up our dataset so we have 200,000 pre-training qualifications, we have over 150 models running and that’s also open to the public. So you’re right about that, that it should be public. I think we should go back to its equity. Johnny Irish: Yeah. I mean, it should be mandatory from the government, you know what, you collected all this data with a consumers’ car that you’re just accessing. It’s not even your own car anymore, you sold it. And that should just be, you know, I’m not saying to reveal trade secrets but if there’s a pothole on the 836, share it to the Ford and Hyundai people. Emrah: Everyone should know. Everyone should know Johnny Irish: Yeah. Emrah: There’s positive externalities on that and that creates welfare for everybody. Johnny Irish: I have a quick question, Emrah: Yeah. Johnny Irish: Why Chooch (kh-ootsh) ? How did you come up with the name Chooch (kh-ootsh) ? Emrah: It’s Chooch (tsh-ootsh) actually. Johnny Irish: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Emrah: *laughs* Khooch is something else but Chooch is a mixture of choose and search. Johnny Irish: Aaahh. Emrah: It’s actually the future of search and because we’re gonna have these glasses on the future and that would be able to understand what’s happening around you in more detail so you look at something you’re eating and it’ll tell you how many calories there is in it and what’s in it. And you’ll look at, like, a car and it’ll tell you where you can buy it or, like, all the details of it. Johnny Irish: Yeah. Yeah. Emrah: So it’s kind of like the future of search and it also means dummy, idiot in Italian dialect. Johnny Irish: Those are the people that say it wrong, though, right? *laughs* *everyone laughs* Emrah: And AI is a dummy. It’s a poor reflection of humanity and there’s also that kind of play on words on that so that’s why we called it Chooch. Johnny Irish: So let me ask you a question, I hate to say artificial intelligence, can computational intelligence compete with human intelligence and/or what are the ways that they can’t? What are we finding out? Emrah: Yeah, great question. So what we’re looking at here is very basic computational capability that’s akin to human understanding but very, very light. So to your nose, “Oh, this is an apple”, “This is a pear.” That’s all it does is it tags. The way it becomes more intelligent than a human is because it works 24/7 and you can proliferate it. So that’s where the whole thing is. It’s not smarter than a human but it works 24/7 and you can just basically, like, it scales to infinity. That’s where it’s better than a human, better than human. It’s like a calculator, you know. Humans know how to calculate to but it takes us some time to do it and, you know, one person at a time, well we can do one topic at a time. Here, you have these can basically put in 0.01 seconds and, like, it’s all over the place. So in that sense, much better than a human. On the other hand, it’s not really that deep and intelligent because, I mean, we’re very, very complex beings. What the machine is doing is basically one or two layers of computational understanding and we’re nowhere near that, probably not for the next 70,70, hundred years. Johnny Irish: It only knows what you feed it, for the most part. Correct? So behind it, there’s always somebody putting data into it? Emrah: Exactly. There’s a human putting data into it or some stream of data coming in and it’s not intelligent in the way it assesses it. It just gives you tags or, like, alerts. It doesn’t really understand context that well. There isn’t that type of understanding. So, you don’t have to be afraid of that. What we have to be concerned about is, okay well, you can do this but this AI can be like, you can basically scale it too infinity now. Johnny Irish: How do you think quantum computing is gonna change that? Emrah: Quantum computing is interesting and we’re in the very early stages of that too. Remember, AI, all these deep learning frameworks, machine learning , they require a lot of compute power and this compute power didn’t exist 5 year ago. This is very, very new. And it came on with the GPU servers, which are graphic processing units of NVIDIA. They’re basically used for gaming. They develop these chips for gaming. And suddenly, they saw, well this is interesting, we can also use it for these types of computations. So that kind of increased the onboarding of AI, so that one with the GPUs and the next stage of this would the quantum computing. So if I want to run millions of models at the same time, then, you know, you’ll need that type of compute power to do that. That’s one of the limiting factors today. Many, many layers of computation that for you to do it, Chooch AI would do image quantification, object detection, segmentation, facial recognition , authentication and all that kind of stuff. You put these in layers and you put it on a machine, it’s very heavy for the machine. So to be able to get to the next level of that, yes quantum computers are gonna be crucial for better AI. Johnny Irish: Now, tell us about your company a little. Who is your target audience? Are you government? Main industry? I mean, I doubt, you know, the regular guy would call you up. Or are you more of research and development? How does it work? Emrah: Yeah. We’re a B-B enterprise. So we’re based of Silicon Valley, what we do is we clone human visual intelligence into machine. And that’s across many, many verticals so we do have government clients, but we also have many, many commercial clients as well. And a lot of our clients are looking for these types of solutions to increase the efficiency of what they’re doing. So let’s say, you know, checking and understanding movements in operating room, basically for compliance for safety. Does everyone have their hard hats on? Does everyone have their gloves on? And it’s stuff like that where you have compliance issues, so we’re working on a lot with that and also researches for client discovery as well. So basically being able to understand the different cells. What’s happening in these biomedical labs and understanding the interaction between different elements over there. So, it’s really B to B, healthcare , government, spacial, and security and safety , it’s really what we do. Johnny Irish: So you guys do a lot of reaching out to these organizations saying, “You know what guys, here’s the technology that you need.” Compared to them saying, “Hey, you have anything new today?” Am I correct with that? Emrah: Well, it’s usually people approach us with their problems already. Saying, “Uh we have a defined issue.” Like, “Hey, I wanna speed up the checking process,” “Hey, I need my OSHA compliance.” Or, you know, “People, I need to make sure are wearing their hard hats.” Better Surgical Outcomes with AI Johnny Irish: Let’s take a step back on that note. Sorry, I just want to take a step back because one thing you briefly mentioned that I was intrigued about was movements in surgery room. Emrah: Yeah. Yeah. So when does the surgeon walk in? When does the patient come in? When does anesthesia start? Stop? What goes into the surgical cavity? What comes out? So all that kind of stuff is what we’re doing as well. Yeah. And it’s more compliant and also assuring best practice so you might say, okay, we collect all these data, and then they do number crunching on them and then basically say, “Hey there’s something going on here which can be practiced all over the place.” So, we’re able to understand those points and to bring it to the market. Johnny Irish: Yeah, and I know a lot are already into this, you know, our guys in the North East, as soon as you mentioned OSHA, it’s Ah. Gotyah. *laughs* Corey Morgan: *laughs* Yeah. “Now we need you, how do we get hold of you?” *all laugh* Johnny Irish: Fellas, we’re running out of time here. We definitely want to have you back on as all our clients, Corey, I and Matt and this station itself were very lucky to get very educated individuals and successful people like yourself. But for the audience, our OSHA customers, and listeners, how do they get a hold of you? And you know, tell us, the floor is yours for a minute to just tell everyone who you are, what you do and how to find you. Emrah: Yeah. So, uh, thank you guys for this. Basically, we’re Chooch AI. We’re a visual AI company. We clone visual human intelligence into machines so that humans don’t need to do it anymore and basically get more work done doing it. We’re Silicon Valley based. We’re in San Mateo. Follow at www.chooch.com is where you can find us. Reach out. You know, we’re very open people. We’re trying to educate you about what AI is all about and see how it can help you with your enterprises and make you a more efficient, productive company because you need to get on the train now.

Johnny Irish: Now if they mention 880thebiz.com, do they get a 20% off discount? Emrah:  Whatever you want. *Everyone laughs* Johnny Irish: No, I’m just kidding. *laughs continue* Emrah: Anything for you guys. *laughs* Corey Morgan: Alright. Johnny Irish: Alright. Emrah, thank you so much for taking the time with us. And I know, I’ve been speaking to your people, spoke to you, obviously, earlier in the week. I know you’re a busy guy, and it’s valuable time. Cory, myself, and Matt, we, again, we can’t thank you enough for this, really fun and educational and we’d definitely have you back. Corey Morgan: Have a great evening. Emrah: Thank you, Corey. Thank you, Johnny. Thank you, Matt. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Johnny Irish: The pleasure was ours. Have a great evening. Bye bye. Emrah: You, too. Thank you. Bye bye. Johnny Irish: Alright, everybody. As we told you, we were gonna bring you segments and, you know, one thing we loved doing, we’ve discussed it ourselves, having four guests come in with different topics, the same industry but different sides of it.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/chooch-ai/,"Chooch AI Vision Studio Product Update | Chooch The computer vision platform at Chooch AI is scaling with our customer and partner engagement. In this webinar, we introduce an updated dashboard offering analytics, alerts, and insights. Read the entire Chooch AI Product Update webinar below. Learn more about our computer vision platform from the Product page. ﻿ Here’s the transcript. Vina: Our API is organized around REST API. This allows our developers to programmatically communicate back and forth with our platform, but it’s just as easy to use as our UI. And also our API is compatible with live streams and live tagging, which is done through the user’s edge device, which brings up our next slide. When we talk about edge device, we refer to a locally placed server that you can run AI models on, which is OnPrem, not in the cloud and close to a video feed. On the dashboard view, there’s a list of devices ready for you to access. Within edge devices, you can manage your own camera streams, set up new devices, and deploy AI models. With edge devices, this is very useful when it comes to increasing privacy and security, since it is locally stored and it’s not in the cloud. So what are some of these models, you’re asking? Our next slide for public models, Chooch has developed these models that allow you to quickly detect any object that you were looking for. Some examples of these public models is fire detection. Here in California, as we all know, we do have a lot of fires, especially detecting those small fires before it becomes massive fires. And then also we do smoke detection , which goes hand in hand with fire detection, as you can probably detect smoke before you can detect the fire. PPE detection, I think that’s really valuable, right now, especially in the workplace, making sure that your employees are wearing hard hats or safety vests or gloves, or even at the airports wearing a mask. PPE detection is very valuable right now during this pandemic. We also have human fall detection , right? Making sure that you’re detecting, if your employee has fallen in the workplace, what type of actions do you need to take and also how to prevent that from happening again. So now that you’ve seen our public models, let me show you some of our dataset tools in our next slide. With dataset you can create your own custom models. As you can see here, we have some airplanes, which is part of our object detection model. So 2D and 3D synthetic data. This is really helpful in helping generate different image viewpoints, object poses, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. As you can see in that screenshot, the airplane is seen in the daytime and also at night. So that’s different lighting conditions, and for generating different angles, such as like tools and machinery to identify different components and different parts of those tools or machinery. 2D and 3D synthetic data can also be really helpful in enhancing your dataset with images that are less common or hard to find. With smart annotations, you can use custom or public models to annotate additional objects within a dataset. Let’s just say you have a thousand images within your dataset, smart annotation will make it easier to detect those additional objects. With augmentation, you can make slight modifications to your images in a dataset by rotating, scaling, or cropping, as you can see the image of that airplane, there’s different angles. Also with data augmentation Chooch provides the ability to copy and modify 2D objects, hundreds of times, to train the AI faster. Lastly, our next slide we’ll do a high level overview of some of our version four updates. So I’ll just highlight that now we have Kubernetes deployment, that’s supported. Our average inference speed has increased up to two times, and so this means that for a basic AI model, you can do 10 predictions within one second. We also support live streams from YouTube and M3U playlists, and we’ve also improve multiple streaming and inference features. So I’ll go ahead and pass this on to Peter who will now discuss more about our new analytics feature. Thank you. Peter: Thank you very much, Vina for that. Again, this is Peter now. Again, we’re going to go and talk a little bit more about the new analytics interface as well as our alerting configuration options, being able to change or manipulate, or provide a workflow on intelligence on what is and is not alarming from the system. From here we have on our analytic interface, we have the ability to view different predictions in the system. This again is a way to look at them in different graph or graphing interfaces, filtering them based on time or feed or model, and then also being able to manipulate based on time. Okay, so here we see some examples of the different interface. On the top, we have our different filtering options. Again, we can choose based on device, so different edge component, which we’ll go in a little bit later. Per stream or camera stream, that’s our terminology for that. Different zones, which we’ll go out in a second again. Hey, different geofences within a video feed. Hey, loading dock, or another part of the interface, and then also events. So hey, I want to see only certain events. On the top right we can also see the different filtering on time. So instead of looking at it for all of time, maybe the last month or the last week, again, being able to filter and dial in this information within our interface. As you make these changes, you can see on the bottom an example of the line graph, but again, this can be changed. We can also see pie graphs or other manipulations like that. And as part of this interface, we also are able to see the actual event or alert image as well. So for example, the first three pictures there, we see a geofence or zone, where a forklift or a person triggered that specific event in the system. And again, we grab a snapshot from that video feed and store it in the solution, and then for the other pictures there, we see an example of a retail situation where maybe a geofence or zone is drawn around a specific kiosk that we want to monitor activities there. So hey, a person came there, maybe they dwelled more than 60 seconds, again, we’re able to data mine that as part of our analytics here. Okay, the next thing here is we’re going to look and talk about our rules interface. So now we’re able to provide a workflow or filtering methodology to define not only when do we get predictions, but then based on certain criteria. And so the first event here is, hey, from a model that we saw going to talk about our earlier, where we have some models that have upwards of a thousand different predictions in it, or again, if you create your own model yourself, you can go ahead and define that. But hey, within this interface, I only want to go ahead and look for the packages as part of a certain model. And so, hey, the first tab here is we define what annotation or label we want to grab from them. And then the next tab… We see, hey, not only do we want to see its physic model triggered based on this prediction, but also a geofence. So in this example here, there’s this zone that was drawn around a loading dock, so when we see in this example here again, not packages, but hey, when a forklift comes into that zone, we want to get an alarm. And then on the last one we have rules. And so in here within these different components, we’re able to also define temporal presence, proximity, and zones, which we saw a second ago. So temporal is time, presence is the amount of people or objects in that area, proximity is distance between, so like social distancing, like what we’re dealing with right now, and then lastly zones. So zone again, we saw it earlier. So what this ultimately means is all the different criteria between events, zones, and rules, would then trigger an event in our system. So we’re trying to filter out the noise, making things only pertinent based on what is actionable, based on the custom use case, things like that. And then we’ll pass on over to Omid to do a live demo of the system. Thank you very much. Omid: Awesome, thank you for that. Let me go ahead, share my screen. All right. All right, so we’re going to begin off with the dashboard. So this is the landing page when you first log into your Chooch dashboard. You’re going to see all of your API documentations , our platform guides , and our how-to videos right here on the right-hand side, and then you’ll also see quick navigational access on the top-hand side. If you scroll down to the bottom, you’ll see all of our latest updates, so what’s changed on the platform, and anytime we make new updates, you’ll be able to see that there as well as our API key. Now just kind of re-highlighting some of the points that our team has talked about. We want to touch on some of the public models real quick, so I can come here and we can go to our object detection models. And here again is where you can quickly leverage our pre-built models out of the box. So there’s no customized development needed. These are ready to go. You can push these to your devices and be able to use them rapidly. You can note that some are very lightweight, they’ll have two classifications and I’ll get into what that means, but basically fall down or standing, and then we have some models that have over 11,000 classifications, like our general deep detection. So this is leveraging and detecting everything from phones to cells, to different actions like swimming, biking, climbing, it incorporates all these all into this one large model. Now there’s a lot of instances where users or customers may need their own custom developed model. So what we allow users to do is to develop those models, and our own team actually leverages as these tools in-house. So if we go to our datasets tab here and we go to my object datasets… Here, you can see some models that we have started, some datasets that we have started annotating ourselves. And if you already have previously annotated datasets, what you can do is just hit upload dataset and upload that dataset as long as it’s in the COCO JSON format, with all the supporting images with it. Now I’m going to touch on this dataset here. This is one that we can all easily relate to, and it’s just on airplanes. Now, what you can see here is we have over 1,700 different images already loaded and annotated on this platform. Now, if you’re doing this manually image per image, that can take a long time and sometimes you may not have all of those images readily available. So what our platform allows you to do is to upload limited amount of data, and then use the additional tools to generate larger amounts of data to be used for model training. And just to give you a reference with these 1,700 images that are already annotated and produced here, we only use 30 real images, one 35 second video clip, and one CAD file. And with that, we’re able to do things like generating synthetic data. So 3D synthetic data, you would upload your CAD file and then a material file with it, and then Chooch would be able to apply either your specific backgrounds or we have generic backgrounds that we could apply to it, to then generate vast amounts of data. 2D Synthetic data is basically once you annotate an object, you can then apply your own backgrounds and themes, and then Chooch starts randomizing and making additional images from your data already. And then we have things like smart annotation, so that’s going through and automatically labeling a lot of these. So if you already have, let’s say 30 aircrafts, you can go through smart annotation and be able to automatically let the system annotate all those aircrafts for you. And then the last thing is I call it the knockout punch, is using augmentation. What augmentation will do, it’ll take all those images and then apply either rotational or horizontal flips, then start adding additional, basically shifting scaling rotation, noise, blur, and brightness, and contrast to the images that are being generated, to allow for different environmental considerations. Now, just to show you what our annotation tool looks like, I’ll go into this image real quick… And here you can see this is going to be a no-code approach to labeling and annotating. So all we’re doing is taking this tool and actually drawing our bounding box around this aircraft. So we can just click drag and draw, and then we can label it as a 747, and once we hit save, you’ll see this number actually increase. Now we have 1,772 images , as well as annotations. And just to give you an idea of what the 2D synthetic looks like, so this aircraft is labeled and facing the left. Now, if I go to the next image, you’ll see the same aircraft is just resized facing the opposite direction with a different background now applied to it. So these are the ways and methods that we’re able to now generate larger amounts of data, so you can create a strong model. Now, once your data is annotated and ready to go, what you can do is just hit, create model, give it a name and then hit create. And once we hit create, Chooch is going to take this internally and start running through and building a model for us. So now what we can do is once we have these models developed and they’re built in-house with your annotations and your maybe data scientists applying their knowledge into it… And again, this can be anything from detecting objects or detecting anything from, let’s say, cancer or bacteria cells on X-ray visions. So it’s basically taking the expertise of an individual, like a doctor, and applying it to the AI. And once we build the model, then you can go to your devices. So in creating the devices, very simple and easy, as long as you meet some of our basic criteria, you’ll see here, you’ll be able to run on Ubuntu and Red Hat, you’ll be a select your GPU, and then if you leverage MQTT for machine-to-machine communication, you can also do that, so when we generate any detections, we can send it to that MQTT broker to then distribute as you have defined it. So in this case, we already have a device created and we’re running on a T4 GPU. And when we come in, we can now apply different streams. So adding a stream is fairly simple, you’d hit add stream, give it a name, and let’s call this… Airport runway, and then you would give it an IP. We’ll just give it a blank IP here, and we’ll hit add string. So now this new stream data has been added. And then you can go into this stream and apply a model. So if we go into one, like our smart loading example, we already have a forklift custom model built, but if we wanted to, we can add additional models to it, so we’re not limiting you on the amount of models that you can add per stream. So let’s see what this actually looks like. So this new screen I just came into is our edge dashboard. This edge capability can be in your private cloud, it can be on premise, or you can also leverage our cloud as well. Now here, you’re seeing all the different people, forklifts, boxes, and packages being annotated and detected here, and you’re seeing everything in red. Those are all the current objects and people that are being detected. Now we want to take it to another level and apply some additional analytics to this. So if we come back to our dashboard here, we can go to our analytics settings… And here’s where we start defining our different classes and groups. So now we can additionally group person and forklift together. So you can create a group like we have done here, and then we can go to our zones tab. So these are all like Peter was mentioning earlier, we can annotate different zones. So in this case, on our zone map, you can see we have an unloading zone and then we have a loading zone. So once you use, and it’s the same tooling that you saw before for doing the annotation, it’s just a no-code approach. We can then go to rules. So in this rule, we have defined danger zone. So it’s a person, forklift, and the unloading zone together for more than one second, then we will generate an alert. So if we go back to our devices, what users can additionally do is be alerted either in real time, or select a different frequency. So here you can see that I’ve applied my email to this alert and reports email, and frequency, you can do either real time, you can do end of hour, end of day, end of week, or end of month, and then you can include the alert images in those as reports as well. So if we go to our analytics tab now… Navigate here… What the system will do now is gather all of the alerts that it has detected, and be able to show us in a graph format or in pie charts, right? And as Peter mentioned, and you can start toggling and applying different filters, so if you have an incident and you want to drill down to say, “Hey, I need to go back to this day, at this hour, on this specific camera,” you can now filter that and quickly access some of the analytics behind it. So here you can see the pie charts with all of our forklifts, our smart loading… And then if we actually go to alert images, you can actually get a snapshot view of some of those alerts that have occurred. So in this case, in our forklift danger, we have a person that’s very close to the forklift and one of the zones. So we’re able to highlight that as well. And what this would look like in the email, if I go back here, you go to our emails, you’ll see that in the email, you can get an alert for the specific device, the stream, the date and time, as well as some of the rules that were triggered here. And then you’ll get again, the snapshot of that incident or that alert or that rule being broken. So with that, I will stop sharing and hand it back over to Andrew. Andrew: Thanks Omid, and thanks to our entire Chooch team for the efforts on those updates. Now, we will open it up for Q&A. We’ll take a brief 30 seconds and let everyone enter any questions on the chat below, and we actually had a couple that just came in and we’ll kick it off and as questions come in we will tackle those. So our first question is, how long does a typical model take to develop? Omid: Yes, I can go ahead and answer that one, Andrew. So typical models can vary on timelines. That variation can be on the amount of data being supplied and the complexity in which we’re tackling. Now, traditionally, a typical model can take between six months to a year to develop, but with the tools that we show today, you can rapidly develop models and being very conservative in a matter of a couple of weeks. And that’s with a lot of testing being done and making sure that the accuracy is where we would like it to be. That’s a good question. Andrew: Yeah, great question. Great question. Another question we have regarding models is, do you all build models or provide just professional services? Peter: I can go ahead and take that one. So great question as well. So we provide either two options here, either we can provide the services for you to do the development and training of a model. We can also train the trainer where we can help provide mentoring or consulting services to use the platform, or the platform as itself, as you saw from Omid’s demonstration is with a little guidance and documentation and self explanatory, where you can potentially do the model development yourself as well. So depending upon the business model and the needs and how complex use cases, we can enter either all three possible pursuits. Thank you. Andrew: Awesome, thanks Peter. Another question regarding the private cloud, can you be installed on my private cloud? Peter: I’ll take that one as well. Our solution is very flexible in that it can be deployed a hundred percent in the cloud, or there could be also what we call the edge component OnPrem, but the edge component can also deployed in your cloud as well, so we’re very dynamic to what can deployed and where it is. We can try and explore that further based on exactly what would be the required compute and things like that. Andrew: Exactly. Thanks Peter. This one’s regarding alerts. Funny timing, right after you Peter, does our platform have the ability to send out SMS alerts, not just email alerts? Peter: Yep, and I’ll grab that one as well. So in addition to email and SMS, be it reports or alerts, we do support MQTT integration as well. And so that’s a standard within the IoT or OnPrem interface and industry, so we can integrate to an MQTT broker and then provide our predictions via JSON or things like that. Thank you. Andrew: Awesome, thanks Peter. Another one that we have here is how many public models does Chooch currently have available to customers? So I can kind of tag this one, we have over 250,000 models and it really comes down to, with our team, with the rapid model development. That’s how we have come to this number. I think we got time for maybe a couple more here as we keep going through here. Oh, someone’s done their homework. You did not mention anything about the IC2 app. Can you talk a little bit more about the IC2 app and how it connects with public models? Peter: One minor correction to what you just said, Andrew, it actually classifications or annotations. So that means, hey, we’re able to look for smoke, car, wave, boat, et cetera, but we have upwards about 80 different models, varying from image, object detection, facial detection, and also text detection. We have up to 250,000 different type of classes for those detections. Going to your second question there, Andrew, thank you for that in regards to IC2. So the IC2 mobile app, be it for Android or Apple is a way to demonstrate and test out our general deep detection, analytic, or model we have in our solution. And so what this does is you’re providing a camera interface, looking at different things. My picture on my wall here, myself, or another person next to me, it’s providing images up to our cloud and we’re providing general detection looking at a person’s gender or age or sentiment or things like that. So again, it’s a way to test out and demonstrate the power of our product. Omid: I just wanted to add to that with the IC2 , we’re constantly developing and iterating on it. And now what we’re also able to do is annotate on the fly. So you could be out in the field somewhere and you need to make an annotation. You can grab an image of it, annotate it, and it’ll actually get pushed up to your cloud dataset. So in your dataset, you’ll have an actual tag there for your IC2 app , and then all the images that you annotate on your phone through the IC2 app will get generated there, so you can incorporate that into your larger datasets. Andrew: Absolutely. And thanks Peter, for the clarification on that one. We got time for one more question here. Does Chooch AI offer pilots to companies, and how long is a typical pilot? We can kind of tag team this one. A pilot or a kickstart can vary anywhere from weeks to months, but the short answer is yes, we do offer that, and would love to talk to you more about how this works with you and scope this process with you. Absolutely, we do. Any team members have anything else to add on that? Peter: Yeah, and I’ll jump in there as well. And again, the pilot is dependent upon the use case, the model to be developed, and just also how ROI or return on investment is measured on that. But ultimately it’s on a case by case basis, and within the timeframe kind of what Andrew budgeted there. Andrew: Absolutely. Well, we are our running short of time here. We try to get to all the questions. Those that we did not, we’ll try to get back to you via this chat. Thank you all for joining today, and please feel to reach out to us at chooch.ai, and we look forward to communicating with you and answering more of your questions. Thanks so much for joining us today, have a great rest of your day. Peter: Thank you very much, everyone. Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

https://www.chooch.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-object-recognition-and-image-recognition/,"What’s the Difference Between Object & Image Recognition? | Chooch Object recognition is a subfield of computer vision , artificial intelligence, and machine learning that seeks to recognize and identify the most prominent objects (i.e., people or things) in a digital image or video with AI models . Image recognition is also a subfield of AI and computer vision that seeks to recognize the high level contents of an image. How Is Object Recognition Different from Image Recognition? If you’re familiar with the domain of computer vision, you might think that object recognition sounds very similar to a related task: image recognition . However, there’s a subtle yet important difference between image recognition and object recognition: In image recognition , the AI model assigns a single high-level label to an image or video. In object recognition , the AI model identifies each and every noteworthy object in the image or video. The best way to illustrate the difference between object recognition and image recognition is through an example. Given a photograph of a soccer game, an image recognition model would return a single label such as “soccer game.” An object recognition model, on the other hand, would return many different labels corresponding to the different objects (e.g., the players, the soccer ball, the goal, etc.), as well as their positions in the image. Object recognition is also not quite the same as another computer vision task called object detection: Object recognition models are given an image or video, with the task of identifying all the relevant objects in it. Object detection models are given an image or video as well as an object class, with the task of identifying all the occurrences of that object (and only that object). For example, suppose you have an image of a street scene: An object detection model would take this image as input as well as an object class such as “pedestrian” or “car,” and then return all the detected locations in the image where that object occurs. An object recognition model, on the other hand, would return the locations of both pedestrians and cars, as well as all other objects it recognizes in the image (buildings, street signs, etc.). You can therefore think of object detection as a “filter” on the output of general object recognition models, looking only for a specific type of object. How Are Object Recognition Models Trained? To perform object recognition, machine learning experts train AI models on extremely large datasets of labeled data. Each member of the dataset includes the source image or video, together with a list of the objects it contains and their positions (in terms of their pixel coordinates). By “studying” this dataset and learning from its mistakes, the AI model gradually improves its capability to recognize different classes of objects during AI training , just as humans learn to recognize different visual concepts. Once the model has been trained on a preexisting dataset, it can start analyzing fresh real-world input. For each image or video frame, the model creates a list of predictions for the objects it contains and their locations. Each prediction is assigned a confidence level—i.e., how much the model believes the prediction represents a real-world object. Predictions that are above a given threshold are classified as objects, and they become the final output of the system. How Are Image Recognition Models Trained? The AI model training process for image recognition is similar to that of object recognition. However, there’s one crucial difference: the labels for the input dataset. Object recognition datasets bundle together an image or video with a list of objects it contains and their locations. Image recognition datasets, however, bundle together an image or video with its high-level description. Before training an image recognition model , machine learning experts need to decide which categories they would like the AI model to recognize. For example, a simple weather recognition model might classify images as “sunny,” “cloudy,” “rainy,” or “snowy.” Each image or video in the training dataset needs to be associated with one of these labels, so that the model can learn it during the training process. Once the image recognition model is trained, it can start analyzing real-world data. The model accepts an image as input, and returns a list of predictions for the image’s label. As with object recognition, each prediction has a confidence level. The prediction with the highest confidence level is selected as the system’s final output. What Is Object Recognition Used for? Object recognition has many practical use cases. Below are just a few applications of object recognition: In retail AI , object recognition models can identify different products and brands on the shelves to analyze how customers interact with and purchase them. In geospatial AI , wildlife researchers can use object recognition on drone footage to analyze how animal populations change in an area over time. In media AI , sales and marketing professionals can use object recognition to identify “objects” such as logos, brands, and products to better understand the contents of an image. Autonomous vehicles require object recognition to identify the most relevant parts of the world around them (e.g., pedestrians, road signs, or other cars). Facial authentication can also be considered a special case of object recognition in which a person’s face is the “object” that must be detected. Modern facial recognition systems can detect thousands of different faces with extremely high accuracy in just a fraction of a second. What is Image Recognition Used For? Like object recognition, image recognition is used in a wide variety of industries and applications. Below are some examples: In manufacturing AI , image recognition models can examine products and classify them as “defective” or “non-defective.” In security AI , construction sites can use image recognition to make sure that workers are wearing their personal protective equipment (PPE), classifying surveillance images as “compliant” or “non-compliant.” ( Click here to see a video of a PPE detection model in action.) In healthcare AI , physicians can use image recognition models to analyze the output of medical imaging devices. For example, an AI trained on mammogram images can classify the machine’s output as “benign” or “potentially cancerous,” flagging it for review by a human expert.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/enterprise-ai-platforms-more-flexible-more-expandable-more-agile/,"AI Platforms | Flexible, Expandable and Agile | Chooch As artificial intelligence technologies continue to develop and advance with the advances in deep learning and more powerful GPUs, businesses are taking notice. But deciding to use enterprise AI solutions is just the tip of the iceberg—in particular, you need to decide between a single-purpose AI system vs. an AI platform. In this article, we’ll discuss why AI platforms are generally more flexible, expandable, and agile than alternatives such as a single-purpose AI system. According to a 2019 survey, 71 percent of organizations say that they plan to use more AI and machine learning in the near future, but we at Chooch AI believe that an AI platform is far preferable to a single-purpose AI system. What is a single-purpose AI system? A single-purpose AI system is just what it sounds like: an AI system that has been built for a single use case. This system may have been built internally, or by a third-party team of AI experts. What is an AI platform? An Enterprise AI Platform is a flexible, extensible framework. A platform makes it easier for businesses to develop solutions and applications using artificial intelligence. These platforms usually include assets such as AI algorithms, pre-trained models, datasets, and/or simple visual interfaces. Many AI platforms have prebuilt workflows for highly common use cases such as facial recognition, object recognition, and recommender systems. It’s free to try to Chooch AI Platform. AI platforms vs. single-purpose systems When you need a solution to a pressing business problem, developers’ first thought is often building a single-purpose AI system. In the same vein, entrepreneurs often have a single motivating idea or application that compels them to launch a startup in the field of AI. It’s true that the domain expertise of a single-purpose AI system (e.g. visual inspection) or service (e.g. data labeling for autonomous driving) should inform your planning, training data, model, and deployment. However, if you ask the author of e.g. a facial recognition system to reapply the product to another domain, such as e.g. identifying and counting cells, it might be nearly as time-consuming as building a new AI system from scratch. This is the biggest problem with a single-purpose AI system: it can be extremely inflexible and unable to adapt to change as your organization grows and evolves. An AI platform, on the other hand, is intended to be suitable for a wide variety of possible use cases. This means that such a platform has to be built to adapt, expand, and extend itself over time. For larger organizations, or for organizations who anticipate making changes in the future, enterprise AI platforms make far more sense. The functions of an AI platform In order to be truly effective as a standalone entity, AI platforms need to wear many different hats. The various functions of a well-rounded AI platform are: Data collection: AI models need vast quantities of data in order to function at peak performance—the more of it the better. Using an AI platform can help automate much of the data collection and organization process. Annotation labeling: Most organizations use AI to perform “supervised learning”: learning from examples that are labeled (e.g. photographs of individuals). AI platforms can help create annotations and labels to prepare your dataset for training. Algorithm and framework selection: Different AI algorithms and frameworks are better suited for different kinds of use cases. An AI platform can help advise you on the best approach to take for your situation. Training: The AI training process can be long and complicated. AI platforms can provide guidance and advice on the best and most efficient way to proceed. AI model generation: Even after training is complete, it can be tricky to take the generated model and start using it for real-world situations. Using an AI platform can help smooth over these bumps. Testing: Before using an AI model in production, it absolutely needs to be tested on a fresh dataset that it hasn’t seen before to assess its true accuracy. Retraining: It’s very rare that an AI model functions perfectly after just a single round of training. Rather, you need to experiment with and fine-tune the results by tweaking the model and the training hyperparameters. Inferencing: Real-time inferencing is crucial for applications such as facial recognition and autonomous vehicles. Deployment to cloud or edge: Finally, AI platforms can help you deploy the finished model to wherever is most convenient for you—whether that’s servers in the cloud or on an edge ai device . Conclusion The Chooch AI platform has a variety of advantages—most importantly, the ability to construct many possible solutions, giving you greater flexibility and agility. That’s why Chooch has built its own AI platform that makes it easy for organizations of all sizes and industries to bring AI into their workflows. Businesses use the Chooch AI platform across a wide range of AI Enterprise Solutions, whether it’s for healthcare, safety and security, retail, or manufacturing. Want to try it out for yourself?

https://www.chooch.com/blog/does-5g-make-edge-ai-less-critical/,"Does 5G Make Edge AI Less Critical? | Chooch Far from making edge AI less critical, 5G can actually complement edge AI, with both technologies working in concert to digitally transform your business. It’s understandable why you might think that 5G removes (or at least reduces) the need for edge AI. After all, one of the motivating concerns for edge AI is the latency and slowdown when uploading data to remote cloud servers. Meanwhile, 5G is expected to be significantly faster than 4G. Estimates vary, but analysts predict that 5G could be as much as 10 times faster than 4G in some locations. So if we use 5G to upload AI data, that means we don’t have to worry about upload speeds anymore—right? Well, not quite. For one, 5G won’t always deliver blazing-fast speeds. According to the article linked above, 5G sees the most performance improvements over 4G in densely populated areas. In more remote locations, however, 5G isn’t much better than 4G—barely twice as fast. In addition, latency is only one reason why businesses are choosing edge AI. Some prefer edge AI because it keeps data on the local device, preserving security and privacy. Another motivation for edge AI is decreased costs of data transmission, and the move from 4G to 5G won’t affect the amount of data that needs to be sent to the cloud. So if 5G won’t obviate the need for edge AI, what is the role of 5G in edge computing? Instead of sending data to remote servers, 5G enables you to send data to edge devices more quickly than with 4G. In fact, according to Mark Gilmour, global head of 5G at Colt Technology Services, it’s 5G that will depend on edge computing, not the other way around. More specifically, 5G will have to rely on the edge in order to justify its continued rollout; the two technologies act as “force multipliers” for each other. Gilmour writes: “If we want to step into the full development of the 5G era, then edge computing is imperative and is a critical succeed/fail factor, not just a standalone technology, bandwidth booster or a ‘nice to have.’ Specifically, edge really comes into play when leveraging factors like low latency and high-performance data processing over a cellular connection. You can have edge without 5G, but for these new 5G use cases, you can’t have 5G without edge.” Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

https://www.chooch.com/blog/the-abcs-of-image-annotation-for-computer-vision/,"The ABCs of Image Annotation or Computer Vision | Chooch What is the fundamental process for developing Computer Vision (CV) systems? The answer: Image Annotation . This blog walks you through the ABCs of image annotation, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced concepts. Step-by-step you’ll discover how this process, foundational to Chooch, is teaching computers what to see. By the end, you will see how Chooch’s commitment to continuous learning and innovation in AI Vision is reshaping the landscape of computer vision. A is for Annotation: The basics Image annotation is the bedrock of computer vision. It is the meticulous process of identifying, labeling, and classifying various components within an image. This could entail drawing bounding boxes around specific objects, highlighting areas of interest, or even tagging individual pixels. The outcome is a comprehensive visual map from which a machine can learn. In most cases, the annotation task is entrusted to human experts, who bring context, understanding and interpretation to what cameras see. They meticulously label data, creating a rich learning environment for machine learning algorithms . This labeled data is like the textbook for machine learning models, helping them navigate the complex tasks of object detection, image segmentation, and semantic segmentation. While annotation might sound simple, it is a labor-intensive process that requires a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the subject matter. Why is so much effort poured into this task? The answer lies in the quality of the training data. Think of training data as the fuel for your machine learning engine. The cleaner and more refined the fuel, the smoother and more efficiently the engine runs. Similarly, the accuracy and quality of your image annotations directly influence the effectiveness of your trained image models. In other words, the better the annotations, the better your model will interpret new images. Poorly annotated images might lead to a model that misunderstands or misinterprets visual data, which can have significant implications, particularly in critical applications like medical imaging or autonomous vehicles. B is for Bounding Boxes: A core technique In image annotation, bounding boxes are much like the frames we put around our favorite pictures. They provide a way of focusing on specific parts of images. This technique involves drawing a rectangular box around the object we want a machine-learning model to recognize and learn from. Each bounding box comes with a label that denotes what it captures – anything from a “cat” to a “car” or a “person.”  Bounding boxes are a staple in object detection tasks, playing a vital role in various applications. Take, for instance, self-driving cars. These autonomous vehicles are equipped with object detection models that have been trained on images annotated with bounding boxes. These boxes serve as guides, helping the model identify key environmental elements like pedestrians, other vehicles, and road signs. This understanding is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of the vehicle. However, like any other tool, bounding boxes have strengths and weaknesses. One of its major strengths is simplicity: they are straightforward to understand and implement. This makes them an ideal choice for many object detection tasks. They are also computationally efficient, a valuable attribute in real-time applications where speed is critical. On the other hand, bounding boxes do have certain limitations. They are less effective when dealing with objects that do not conform to a rectangular shape, as the box may include irrelevant background “noise.” They struggle to differentiate between overlapping objects, as the boxes may encompass more than one object causing ambiguity. C is for Classes and Categories: Organizing annotations Organizing annotations into classes and categories plays a vital role in training machine learning models for image annotation tasks. Each labeled item in image annotation belongs to a specific class or category, which can encompass a diverse range of objects or concepts. From concrete objects like “dogs” and “cars” to abstract ideas like “happy” or “dangerous,” the choice of classes depends on the specific computer vision task. By organizing annotations into classes, we enable the machine learning model to recognize patterns associated with each class. This allows the model to learn and understand the characteristics and features of specific objects distinguishable in one class. As a result, when faced with new, unseen images, the model can accurately predict its appropriate class. Selecting the right classes is crucial for successfully training machine learning models. The granularity and level of detail in defining classes can significantly impact the model’s performance. Fine-grained classes provide a more specific representation, enabling the model to capture intricate patterns and nuances within the data. Coarse-grained classes offer a more generalized object perspective, which can be advantageous when dealing with large-scale datasets or diverse image collections. In addition to classes, organizing annotations into meaningful categories further enhances training. Categories provide a hierarchical structure that groups similar classes, facilitating an understanding of relationships and dependencies between annotations. This hierarchical organization helps create a cohesive framework that aids in training models for complex image annotation tasks. D is for Deep Learning: The power behind computer vision Deep learning , a subset of machine learning , has emerged as a powerful technology that drives most modern computer vision applications. At the heart of deep learning for computer vision lies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized neural network designed for image-processing tasks. With their ability to automatically learn and extract features from raw pixel data, CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision. One of the key requirements for deep learning models, including CNNs, is a large amount of annotated data. Annotated data refers to images labeled with precise and accurate annotations, such as bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or keypoint coordinates. These annotations provide ground truth information to the model, allowing it to learn and generalize from the labeled examples. The quality and thoroughness of the annotations play a crucial role in the deep learning model’s performance. When images are meticulously annotated, capturing detailed information about the objects or concepts of interest, the model gains a more comprehensive understanding of the data. This enables the model to learn intricate patterns and make more accurate predictions when presented with new, unseen images. E is for Evaluation: Assessing model performance Once a machine learning model is trained, evaluating its performance is a critical step in understanding its effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. Evaluation allows us to assess how well the model generalizes new, unseen data and provides insights into its strengths and limitations. One common approach to evaluating model performance in computer vision tasks is using a separate set of annotated images known as the validation set. The validation set is distinct from the training set and serves as an unbiased sample of data that the model has not yet seen during training. By evaluating the model on this independent set of images, we can obtain a realistic estimation of the model’s performance with unseen data. During evaluation, the model’s predictions on the validation set are compared to the actual annotations or ground truth labels. This comparison enables the calculation of various evaluation metrics that quantify various aspects of the model’s performance. Some commonly used metrics in computer vision evaluation include precision, recall, and the F1 score. Evaluation is an iterative process, and it is common to fine-tune models based on the insights gained from the evaluation results. This may involve adjusting model parameters, exploring different training strategies, or collecting additional annotated data to address specific challenges identified during the evaluation. By continuously evaluating and refining the model’s performance, work can progress in developing robust and reliable computer vision systems. Effective evaluation enables informed decisions, optimized model performance, and ultimately AI systems that meet the highest accuracy, reliability, and usability standards. F is for Future: AI-assisted image annotation Looking toward the future, AI-assisted image annotation emerges as a promising development area that can revolutionize the annotation process. By leveraging the power of AI models , we can reduce the workload for human annotators, enhance annotation consistency, and accelerate the overall annotation process. AI-assisted image annotation involves using machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to pre-annotate images automatically. These AI models can be trained on large, annotated datasets, learning to recognize and label objects, regions, or concepts within images. Automating the initial annotation step significantly reduces the burden on human annotators, enabling them to focus on more complex or ambiguous cases that require human expertise. The advantages of AI-assisted annotation go beyond time savings. With the assistance of AI models , annotation consistency can be greatly improved. Human annotators may introduce inconsistencies or subjective biases in their annotations, but AI algorithms can provide a more objective and standardized approach to labeling images. This ensures more annotation consistency, crucial for training accurate and reliable machine learning models. Where will the ABCs take you? Image annotation is a vital process for computer vision, and adhering to the ABCs of image annotation is crucial for accurate and reliable results. At Chooch, we understand the significance of meticulous annotation, whether drawing precise bounding boxes, organizing classes, or evaluating model performance. By adhering to these principles, we ensure annotation quality, consistency, and relevance, enabling the development of robust and effective machine learning models .

https://www.chooch.com/blog/comparison-guide-to-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning/,"A Guide to Deep Learning vs Machine Learning | Chooch Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are subsets of artificial intelligence, playing pivotal roles in advanced technology like self-driving cars, voice assistants, and recommendation systems. Machine learning is a data analysis method that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It uses algorithms to “learn” information directly from data without a predetermined equation as a model. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning , uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain to carry out machine learning. These networks can transform inputs in increasingly abstract ways, enabling them to solve complex problems previously thought to be the exclusive domain of human cognition. Generally, deep learning is machine learning, but not all machine learning is deep learning. Deep learning can tackle tasks that are too complex for traditional machine learning processes but requires more data and computational horsepower. An introduction to machine learning Machine learning, a foundational part of artificial intelligence (AI), is fundamentally a method of data analysis that empowers computers to uncover hidden insights without explicit programming. Its central principle is rooted in systems learning from data, identifying patterns, and making decisions with minimal human intervention . Three types of machine learning: 1. Supervised Learning In this type of learning, the model is given labeled training data along with the desired output. The goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. It’s akin to learning with a teacher who provides guidance. Common algorithms used in supervised learning include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. According to a survey conducted in 2020, about 89% of data scientists use supervised learning methods in their work. 2. Unsupervised Learning In this scenario, the model is given unlabeled data and must discover the underlying structure and relationships within that data on its own. This is analogous to learning without a teacher. Common algorithms in unsupervised learning include K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis. While less commonly used than supervised learning, unsupervised learning is vital for anomaly detection and understanding complex datasets. 3. Reinforcement Learning Here, the model learns to make decisions based on rewards and penalties. It’s akin to learning by trial and error taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. Reinforcement learning has been instrumental in teaching computers to perform tasks once thought to require human intuition, such as playing complex games like Go and Chess. AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google DeepMind, used reinforcement learning to defeat the world champion in the board game Go in 2016, marking a significant milestone in AI research. An introduction to deep learning Deep learning, a subset of machine learning , employs artificial neural networks with several layers (“deep” structures) to model and understand complex patterns in datasets. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—to learn from substantial amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help optimize the predictions. The types of deep learning include: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) Inspired by the human brain, ANNs are the foundation of deep learning. They are designed to simulate the behavior of the human brain to solve complex pattern recognition tasks. ANN’s capabilities are highlighted by Google’s DeepMind using them to secure 32 wins out of 40 games against the world champion of the Ancient Game of Go . Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) CNNs are primarily used in pattern recognition within images and are mostly applied in image recognition tasks. They have been instrumental in the medical field, with deep learning techniques achieving 95% accuracy in detecting Parkinson’s disease through voice samples. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) RNNs excel in learning from sequential data, making them especially effective for natural language processing and time-series analysis. Key differences between machine learning and deep learning Data dependencies Machine learning algorithms can perform well in scenarios with massive and large datasets, while deep learning algorithms are better suited for massive datasets. This is because DL models learn complex patterns from the data, and the accuracy of these models generally improves with more data. Computational requirements Deep learning models require significantly more computational power than machine learning models due to their complexity and the large datasets they use. This is especially true for DL models with many layers, often requiring high-performance clusters and other substantial infrastructure. While ML models can run on a single instance or server cluster, DL models typically require powerful hardware accelerators, often GPUs. Feature engineering Data scientists often manually handle data extraction in machine learning, which can be time- and labor-intensive. In contrast, deep learning handles feature extraction automatically during the learning process, which can significantly reduce the workload of data scientists. However, this automatic feature extraction in DL is balanced by the requirement of network topology design, which can put a heavy load on the execution time and efficiency. Interpretability Machine learning models offer precise rules that can be used to explain the decisions behind specific choices, making them easier to interpret. In contrast, the decisions made by deep learning models can seem “arbitrary,” providing the user with little interpretive capability to rationalize choices. This lack of interpretability in DL models is often called the “black box” problem. Training time The training time for DL models is typically longer and more complex due to their intricate neural layers. In contrast, ML algorithms can often be trained in a much shorter time. Problem-solving approach In machine learning , large problems are often broken down into smaller chunks, each solved separately, and then all solutions are put back together. However, deep learning solves problems end-to-end, meaning it takes in raw input (like image pixels or text) and processes it through multiple layers of its neural network to output a result without any need for manual feature extraction or rule-based programming. Hardware dependencies Both machine learning and deep learning require significant computational resources, but the extent and nature of these requirements differ. ML can often run efficiently on modest hardware, while DL generally demands more powerful hardware due to its need for processing large neural networks. For instance, graphics processing units (GPUs) are often employed for DL because they can perform many operations simultaneously – an ideal feature for training large neural networks. Algorithm types ML includes a variety of algorithm types, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, k-means, random forest, and dimensionality reduction algorithms. On the other hand, DL is more focused and includes algorithms such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks, and deep belief networks. Applications of machine learning and deep learning Machine learning in action Traditional ML algorithms, like decision trees, are rule-based and are excellent for problems where the reasoning process is well-understood and can be defined in terms of rules or conditions. Machine learning techniques are effective with smaller datasets, especially if the dataset is well-curated, like structured data, where features have clear definitions and relationships. Machine learning has wide-ranging applications in various fields: Predicting house prices With Linear Regression, we can estimate the price of a house based on simple features such as the number of bedrooms, location, and size of the house. This is commonly used in the real estate industry. Diagnosing patient illnesses Decision Trees and Random Forests can help doctors diagnose diseases by looking at past patient records. This tool can learn from these past cases to make accurate predictions. Recognizing faces Support Vector Machines (SVMs) help in recognizing faces in images. This can be used in various systems, such as security, to identify or verify a person from a digital image or a video frame. Suggesting products or movies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used in services like Amazon or Netflix to suggest items you might like. This is done based on your past behavior and the behavior of other users like you. Filtering spam and understanding customer opinions Naive Bayes is used to sort your emails, identifying which ones are likely to be spam. It’s also used to understand whether customer reviews are positive, negative, or neutral. Deep learning in action Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is particularly adept at managing problems where the reasoning process is intricate and not readily expressible in explicit rules. Unstructured data, such as images, audio, and text, often contain relationships and complex patterns that are challenging to capture using traditional, rule-based methods. It’s in these domains where deep learning truly shines. Deep learning relies heavily on artificial neural networks, particularly those with numerous layers, hence the term “deep.” These multilayered networks mimic the human brain’s function, allowing the model to learn intricate patterns and perform abstract reasoning. Because of this, deep learning can outperform traditional machine learning in tasks involving high-dimensional, unstructured data. Let’s consider some common applications of deep learning to illustrate its capabilities: Computer vision Deep learning algorithms are proficient at identifying, classifying, and labeling objects in images and videos. They form the backbone of numerous applications, including facial recognition software, object detection in surveillance systems, and even disease diagnosis in medical imaging. Language translation Deep learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, including language translation. For example, Google’s neural machine translation system uses deep learning to translate between languages with remarkable accuracy, often matching or surpassing human translators. Sentiment analysis Deep learning is extensively used in sentiment analysis, which involves understanding human emotions from text. This application is particularly beneficial in marketing and customer service, where understanding customer sentiment can inform strategy and improve service delivery. Autonomous driving Autonomous vehicles utilize deep learning to perceive their environment and make driving decisions. They use it to recognize objects, predict their movements, and determine optimal paths. Virtual assistants Deep learning is crucial in virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant, and Apple’s Siri. These systems use it to understand spoken language, recognize the user’s voice, and generate natural-sounding responses. Playing favorites—Deep learning vs. machine learning Machine learning and deep learning are two significant subsets of artificial intelligence with unique strengths. Machine learning excels in structured data environments with clear rules, making it ideal for applications ranging from real estate to healthcare. On the other hand, deep learning is particularly adept with unstructured data like images, audio, and text, making strides in computer vision, language processing, and autonomous driving. Choosing between them is not superiority but problem applicability, data nature, and resource availability. Both continue to drive advancements across numerous fields, revolutionizing the era of artificial intelligence applications.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/5-common-problems-with-computer-vision-and-their-solutions/,"5 Common Problems With Computer Vision And Solutions | Chooch Computer vision (CV) is reshaping industries with diverse applications, from self-driving cars to augmented reality, facial recognition systems, and medical diagnostics. “No industry has been or will be untouched by computer vision innovation, and the next generation of emerging technologies will generate new market opportunities and innovations, including: Scene understanding and fine-grained object and behavior recognition for security, worker health and safety, and critical patient care.” Despite the robust growth and increasing market value, computer vision still faces challenges​. Innovations like the shift from model-centric to data-centric artificial intelligence and the rise of Generative AI appear promising for tackling common computer vision challenges. As we delve into five common problems, we’ll explore the solutions, and how they pave the way for a more advanced and efficient use of computer vision. 1. Variable lighting conditions Problem: One of the significant challenges for computer vision systems is dealing with varied lighting conditions . Changes in lighting can considerably alter the appearance of an object in an image, making it difficult for the system to recognize. The lighting challenges in computer vision is complex due to the difference between human visual perception and camera image processing. While humans can easily adjust to different lighting conditions, computer vision systems can struggle with it. Varying amounts of light in other parts of the combined with shadows and highlights distort the appearance of objects. Moreover, different types of light (e.g., natural, artificial, direct, diffused) can create other visual effects, further complicating the object recognition task for these systems. Solution: Techniques such as histogram equalization and gamma correction help counteract the effects of variable lighting conditions. Histogram equalization is a method that improves the contrast of an image by redistributing the most frequent intensity values across the image. At the same time, gamma correction adjusts the brightness of an image by applying a nonlinear operation to the pixel values. These methods adjust the brightness across an image, improving the system’s ability to identify objects irrespective of lighting conditions. Another approach to the problem of variable lighting conditions involves using hardware solutions, such as infrared sensors or depth cameras. These devices can capture information that isn’t affected by lighting conditions, making object recognition more manageable. For instance, depth cameras can provide data about the distance of different parts of an object from the camera, which help identify the object even when lighting conditions make it difficult to discern its shape or color in a traditional 2D image. Similarly, infrared sensors can detect heat signatures, providing additional clues about an object’s identity. 2. Perspective and scale variability Problem: Objects can appear differently depending on their distance, angle, or size in relation to the camera. This variability in perspective and scale presents a significant challenge for computer vision systems . In remote sensing applications, accurate object detection from aerial images is more difficult due to the variety of objects that can be present, in addition to significant variations in scale and orientation​. Solution: Techniques such as Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) , Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), and similar methods can identify and compare objects in images regardless of scale or orientation. SIFT is a method that can more reliably identify objects even among clutter and under partial occlusion, as it is an invariant to uniform scaling, orientation, and illumination changes. It also offers partial invariance to affine distortion. The SIFT descriptor is based on image measurements over local scale-invariant reference frames established by local scale selection. The SIFT features are local and based on the object’s appearance at particular interest points, making them invariant to image scale and rotation. 3. Occlusion Problem: Occlusion refers to scenarios where another object hides or blocks part of an object . This challenge varies depending on the context and sensor setup used in computer vision . For instance, in object tracking, occlusion occurs when an object being tracked is hidden by another object, like two people walking past each other or a car driving under a bridge. In range cameras, occlusion represents areas where no information is present because the camera and laser are not aligned, or in stereo imaging, parts of the scene that are only visible to one of the two cameras. This issue poses a significant challenge to computer vision systems as they may struggle to identify and track partially obscured objects correctly over time. Solution: “Techniques like Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) can help separate an image’s background and foreground, potentially making occluded objects more distinguishable. RPCA is a modification of the principal component analysis (PCA) statistical procedure, which aims to recover a low-rank matrix from highly corrupted observations. In video surveillance, if we stack the video frames as matrix columns, the low-rank component naturally corresponds to the stationary background, and the sparse component captures the moving objects in the foreground​. Training models on datasets that include occluded objects can improve their ability to handle such scenarios. However, creating these datasets poses a challenge due to the requirement of a large number and variety of occluded video objects with modal mask annotations. A possible solution is to use a self-supervised approach to create realistic data in large quantities. For instance, the YouTube-VOI dataset contains 5,305 videos, a 65-category label set including common objects such as people, animals, and vehicles, with over 2 million occluded and visible masks for moving video objects. A unified multi-task framework, such as the Video Object Inpainting Network (VOIN), can infer invisible occluded object regions and recover object appearances . The evaluation of the VOIN model on the YouTube-VOI benchmark demonstrates its advantages in handling occlusions​​. 4. Contextual understanding Problem: Computer vision systems often need help with understanding context. They can identify individual objects in an image, but understanding the relationship between them and interpreting the scene can be problematic. Solution: Scene understanding techniques are being developed to tackle this problem. One particularly challenging field within scene understanding is Concealed Scene Understanding (CSU), which involves recognizing objects with camouflaged properties in natural or artificial scenarios. The CSU field has advanced in recent years with deep learning techniques and the creation of large-scale public datasets such as COD10K , which has advanced the development of visual perception tasks, especially in concealed scenarios. A benchmark for Concealed Object Segmentation (COS), a crucial area within CSU, has been created for quantitative evaluation of the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, the applicability of deep CSU in real-world scenarios has been assessed by restructuring the CDS2K dataset to include challenging cases from various industrial settings​. Furthermore, incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can help models understand relations between objects in an image . GNNs have become a standard component of many 2D image understanding pipelines, as they can provide a natural way to represent the relational arrangement between objects in an image. They have been especially used in tasks such as image captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), and image retrieval. These tasks require the model to reason about the image to describe it, explain aspects of it, or find similar images, which are all tasks that humans can do with relative ease but are difficult for deep learning models. 5. Lack of annotated data Problem: Training computer vision models necessitates a substantial amount of annotated data. Image annotation, a critical component of training AI-based computer vision models, involves human annotators structuring data. For example, images are annotated to create training data for computer vision models identifying specific objects across a dataset ​. However, manual annotation is a labor-intensive process that often necessitates domain expertise, and this process can consume a significant amount of time, particularly when dealing with large datasets​. Solution: Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques offer promising solutions to this issue. These methods leverage unlabeled data, making the learning process more efficient . Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to jointly learn from sparsely labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled auxiliary data. The underlying assumption is that the unlabeled data is often drawn from the same distribution as the labeled data. SSL has been used in various application domains such as image search, medical data analysis, web page classification, document retrieval, genetics, and genomics. Unsupervised learning (UL) aims to learn from only unlabeled data without utilizing any task-relevant label supervision. Once trained, the model can be fine-tuned using labeled data to achieve better model generalization in a downstream task​. Also, techniques like data augmentation can artificially increase the size of the dataset by creating altered versions of existing images. Computer vision’s next frontier and AI’s role as its primary catalyst Computer vision is an immensely beneficial technology with widespread applications, spanning industries from retail to manufacturing , and beyond. However, it has its challenges. Factors such as varied lighting conditions, perspective and scale variability, occlusion, lack of contextual understanding, and the need for more annotated data have created obstacles in the journey toward fully efficient and reliable computer vision systems . Researchers and engineers continually push the field’s boundaries in addressing these issues. Techniques such as histogram equalization, gamma correction, SIFT, SURF, RPCA, and the use of CNNs, GNNs, and semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, along with data augmentation strategies, have all been instrumental in overcoming these challenges. Continued investment in research, development, and training of the next generation of computer vision scientists is vital for the field’s evolution. As computer vision advances, it will play an increasingly important role in driving efficiency and innovation in many sectors of the economy and society. Despite the challenges faced, the future of computer vision technology remains promising, with immense potential to reshape our world. Computer vision platforms of tomorrow The most recent wave of generative AI technologies will prove instrumental in shaping the next iterations of computer vision solutions. Today’s computer vision platforms use AI to detect events, objects, and actions that neural networks have been trained to identify, but tomorrow’s platforms may use AI to speculate the outcome of events, objects’ state or positions, and the results of actions before they occur. The true challenge of today’s AI-powered vision-based systems is their narrow understanding. For a model to “know” how to spot more objects, it must be familiar with those things. More knowledge means more training and heavier models. Our society is on the precipice of general AI, which will provide always-on, hyper-intelligent, digital assistants to tomorrow’s enterprises. Such assistants will not just know how to detect things it knows, but they will know how to learn and how to communicate what they see. Replicating human visual understanding has never been closer to a reality as it is today.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/6-ways-computer-vision-is-driving-predictive-maintenance/,"6 Ways Computer Vision is Driving Predictive Maintenance As we enter the age of advanced technology known as Industry 4.0, smart devices, computer vision AI, and data analysis enable manufacturers to build a comprehensive strategy that combines various data-driven approaches to optimize manufacturing processes known as predictive manufacturing. Manufacturers are applying data and predictive modeling to anticipate and prevent equipment failures or breakdowns, known as predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance is helping manufacturers to improve the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of their operations. Benefits of predictive maintenance beyond predicting maintenance The adoption of predictive maintenance has grown in recent years due to advancements in technology, the availability of data, and the benefits both offer. However, predictive maintenance isn’t just about preventing machine breakdowns, it has several other benefits that positively affect various aspects of manufacturing. Here are a few reasons why manufacturing companies are embracing predictive maintenance: Reduces costs: Identifying potential equipment issues before they disrupt operations saves time and money. Early detection, coupled with the ability to forecast maintenance needs, reduces emergency repairs and extends machine life. Increases safety: Proactively addressing equipment issues reduces the risk of employee accidents or injuries due to equipment failure and improves the overall safety of their work environment. This EHS commitment provides employees with a greater sense of security. Reduces workloads: By minimizing unexpected equipment breakdowns and failures, employees are less likely to be called upon for emergency repairs or troubleshooting tasks. This reduces the burden on their workload and improves productivity and job satisfaction. Improves planning and scheduling: Based on data-driven insights, maintenance activities can be planned and scheduled. A clear plan and schedule for maintenance tasks enables employees to better allocate their time and resources and reduces the likelihood of last-minute disruptions or overtime work. Competitive advantage: By reducing operational costs, improving product quality, and enhancing customer satisfaction, companies can gain a competitive edge. By minimizing equipment downtime and maximizing production efficiency, they can deliver products more reliably and meet customer demands effectively. It’s clear that by optimizing maintenance, manufacturers not only improve operations and reduce costs but also create a more efficient and productive environment for their employees leading to an improved overall sense of well-being and superior job performance. The role of computer vision in predictive maintenance So where does computer vision fit in. Manufacturing is a world of precision and consistency; the tiniest defect can make a big impact. Traditional equipment inspection methods, either by human scrutiny or machine systems, have limitations, such as fatigue, lack of adaptability, and inability to spot certain defects. Computer vision is beginning to play a crucial role in helping to augment traditional inspection processes. It can collect massive amounts of data from equipment, machinery, or production environments which can be analyzed faster and with greater accuracy, saving time and effort compared to traditional methods. By analyzing real-time sensor data and historical performance data, computer vision can easily identify patterns, detect anomalies, and provide early warnings of potential equipment issues. This allows maintenance teams to schedule maintenance activities proactively, minimizing downtime, reducing costs, and optimizing the lifespan of equipment. So, let’s explore the 6 ways computer vision is helping in predictive maintenance: 1. Anomaly detection: Computer vision algorithms can analyze images or videos captured by cameras to detect anomalies or deviations from normal operating conditions. By comparing real-time visual data to baseline or reference images, computer vision systems can quickly identify signs of potential equipment failure, such as abnormal vibrations, leaks, cracks, or irregularities in the appearance of components. These anomalies can often be very subtle and easily missed by the human eye, making computer vision far more accurate and reliable for detecting defects faster. 2. Wear and tear assessment: Computer vision can monitor the wear and tear of equipment components over time. Advanced image segmentation techniques, like semantic segmentation, identify the exact location and size of the potential equipment degradation. By collecting this data at these levels of specificity, it makes it easier to track over time the condition of machine parts and signs of degradation or corrosion to estimate their remaining useful life. This information helps maintenance teams plan timely replacements or repairs, minimizing downtime, and optimizing maintenance schedules. 3. Real-time monitoring: Computer vision enables real-time monitoring of production processes and equipment performance. By analyzing visual data, computer vision systems detect deviations from normal operating parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or speed. When abnormal conditions are detected, pre-programmed actions can be initiated, and real-time notifications can alert maintenance teams to intervene promptly to prevent potential failures that could disrupt operations. 4. Object recognition and tracking: Computer vision can recognize and track objects, such as tools, parts, or products, within a manufacturing environment. Computer vision models using algorithms like Single Shot MultiBox Detectors (SSD), can detect and classify multiple objects within video images in real time. This helps in monitoring the movement and usage of equipment and assets within the manufacturing environment. For example, camera video streams can be analyzed in real time to track the location of tools and equipment to prevent loss or identify instances of improper handling. 5. Inspection automation: By combining computer vision, robotics, and data analysis, equipment inspection processes and condition reports can be automated. For example, video data captured by cameras can be analyzed using deep learning algorithms to learn hierarchical representations of this data to deliver more accurate object recognition, image classification, and location segmentation. This level of analysis can detect defects, measure dimensions, or identify irregularities in components faster and more accurately; reducing the reliance on human inspectors and speeding up maintenance procedures. 6. Predictive analytics: Computer vision data, when combined with other sensor data, can be leveraged for predictive analytics. By analyzing historical visual data and equipment performance, computer vision systems can identify patterns, correlations, or early warning signs of potential failures. This enables maintenance teams to predict maintenance actions before they are needed and plan proactive interventions. The future of predictive maintenance with computer vision Computer vision provides manufacturers the ability to continuously monitor the health of equipment without fatigue. Just like a human, when a computer vision system detects a potential failure pattern, it can alert the maintenance team, allowing for timely replacement and avoid unexpected downtime. In a nutshell, computer vision is making machine maintenance smarter, safer, and more efficient. Not without implementation challenges, including data privacy concerns, the need for high-quality data for training AI models, and the technological infrastructure required, predictive maintenance driven by computer vision technology will become the norm in manufacturing. And as it continues to advance and merge with other technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, it’s set to revolutionize machine maintenance even further.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/8-examples-of-retail-automation-to-future-proof-your-business/,"8 Examples of Retail Automation to Future-Proof Business | Chooch Imagine that you’re going camping – and before your trip, you visit a sporting goods retailer . The sales associate doesn’t seem that informed about the products or camping. After you locate the empty shelf where you hoped your ideal tent would be, you walk out empty handed. But at the next store, everything you need is in stock, you receive a discount as part of an in-store promotion, and the sales associate suggests useful products you actually need. As a consumer, you might chalk up the difference to better management. But as a retail leader, you’ll recognize automation as the differentiator. Retail automation unlocks smarter workflows across every step of the retail journey, from headquarters to warehouses to ecommerce sites and brick-and-mortar stores. By automating manual processes in inventory management, security, order fulfillment, and other areas, retailers enjoy lower shrinkage, stronger customer loyalty, higher profits, and other benefits. The future of retail While the pandemic gets a lot of credit for changing the way we shop, consumer expectations have been evolving for a while. The Harvard Business Review found 73% of consumers prefer shopping through multiple channels. Retailers have responded offering more personalization and omnichannel services, such as curbside pickups, special delivery options, and in-store only offers. Some luxury retailers have added refreshments and private shopping time and fashion shows for in-store experiences; many big box and budget retailers have expanded online inventory and expedited shipping times to rival Amazon Prime offers. Some forward-thinking retailers are using virtual and augmented reality to provide tailored browsing and buying options. The key here is automation. A recent study showed retail AI will increase ninefold by 2025, with up to 70% of routine tasks at least partially automated by 2025. Those retailers who understand how to use technology, particularly automation and computer vision tools, are the most likely to dominate their market in the years to come. Future proofing through automation Here are a few ways retailers use automation to cater to your preferences while beating their competitors. Predicting shopper needs. Data from sales channels helps them recommend the right products to you, offer discount codes, and create personalized emails that provide an easier and more helpful experience – so you buy more without perceiving any upselling. Warehouse automation . Retailers like Walmart already use robots to clean, select and pack inventory, scan barcodes, and optimize warehouse layouts. Inventory management software . Retailers can accurately forecast demand, track stock, and track inventory across a mix of environments such as pop-up shops, e-commerce, brick and mortar stores, and partner channels. Smarter marketing. Data-driven insights unlock personalized campaigns, such as tailored messages on emailed receipts.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/4-ways-generative-ai-is-improving-computer-vision/,"4 Ways Generative AI Is Improving Computer Vision | Chooch Unless you’ve been living in a cave for the last year, you’ve probably heard of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Bard. Chances are, you’ve tested some out. Generative AI is already fusing with our daily processes, after all; Microsoft is embedding ChatGPT into its applications , just as Google is integrating Bard into G-suite tools . So far, generative AI tools have gotten the most attention for the ways they help people in everyday life, such as using text-based outputs to write software code, college application essays, or a clinical treatment plan. Some use visual output to design websites or produce 3D models for video games, while a new Beatles song using an old clip of John Lennon’s voice uses audio-based output. But generative AI is also improving existing technology – including computer vision. From generating fresh content to creating synthetic data , generative AI is bringing a new sophistication to computer vision technology. Today we’re looking at four improvements to computer vision that generative AI is making, and how Chooch’s AI Vision Platform and new ImageChat model is unleashing these benefits. From insight to innovation If you’re not familiar with how generative AI works, it draws on several techniques. Most of us are familiar with large language models (LLM), a branch of machine learning. These models are trained on massive data sets, including text, images, and sounds. Using prediction algorithms, they respond to human prompts; our feedback and reinforcement learning helps them refine their output. But generative AI does much more than answer questions. Here are four ways it works with computer vision to bring deeper insights and greater innovation to organizations. #1. Improved quality and accuracy One of the primary computer vision use cases is to recognize and classify objects – from weapon detection to facial recognition to PPE checks . Generative AI enhances this ability by removing noise and artifacts from imagery and video, increasing image resolution, and canceling background noise. The result: sharper imagery, faster object identification, and fewer false positives. This can be critical for a security team using computer vision to detect weapons at a school or a factory monitoring PPE compliance to prevent shop floor accidents. It can also help clinicians use highly detailed medical imaging scans in ultrasound, x-ray, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose conditions, understand where to place a biopsy needle, or form a treatment plan. #2. The creation of realistic images Because generative AI can create extremely realistic new images and videos, it can assist computer vision by generating original 3D models of objects, machine components, buildings, medications, people, landscapes, and more. Users don’t have to search for an actual image or footage that already exists; they can simply develop their own and extract more useful insights. For an engineering company, this could take the form of designing innovative new products via simulation; federal organizations could develop smarter prevention and mitigation strategies for wildfires and other natural disasters by analyzing realistic footage and photos of simulated events to understand how they would unfold. #3. Synthetic data Data is the lifeblood of computer vision, but data annotation has been a barrier to AI adoption. Generative AI overcomes this barrier by creating synthetic, automatically labelled, new data elements that help train computer vision models how to see, learn, and predict. Although organizations have been reluctant to share sensitive data with third parties because of the security risk, privacy is no longer a concern as synthetic data can’t be linked to a real person. This also addresses the ethics issue of bias in models; while teams have worried about bias filtering into models through the data they’re trained on, synthetic data can eliminate any possibility of bias. #4. More comprehensive data resources Computer vision models are trained on vast quantities of data – but some generative AI models tap into even bigger data stores, including data that’s never been leveraged before. Combining computer vision AI and large language models for image-to-text provides the ability to gain more detailed insights into visuals. Analysts can craft targeted prompts to obtain specific information based on what’s most important to their business. For example, they can ask questions like “what objects are present in this image?” or “where is the person located in the video?”  By fine-tuning text prompts, they can narrow down their text queries to extract precise information which they may not have been able to do before. More actionable, higher quality data enhances the accuracy of computer vision tools and accelerates the benefits that they bring to organizations. Chooch is taking generative AI capabilities to the next level with ImageChat TM Chooch is one of the few companies globally that currently offers generative AI technology for image-to-text.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/what-is-object-detection/,"What Is Object Detection | Chooch Object detection, also known as object recognition, is a computer vision technique to identify and classify specific objects or patterns within an image or video. Object detection detects the presence of objects, recognizes what they are, and identifies their location in the image. Often times, object detection and image recognition/classification are used synonymously. But while they are similar, they are very distinct computer vision tasks. What is an object detection model? An object detection model, also known as an object recognition algorithm, is a computational model designed to recognize and classify objects within images or videos. These models are trained on large datasets with labeled examples, where each example is associated with a specific object class or category. Object detection models use a variety of techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning to learn the patterns and features that distinguish each specific object class or category. For example, given a photograph of a city street, an object detection model would return a list of annotations or labels for all the different objects in the image: traffic lights, vehicles, road signs, buildings, etc. These labels would contain both the appropriate category for each object, such as “person” and a “bounding box,” or rectangle in which the object is completely contained. Another example is given a photograph of a dog, an object recognition model returns a label and bounding box for the dog, as well as other prominent objects. The difference between object detection and image recognition models As mentioned earlier, while both object detection and image recognition are similar, an image recognition model categorizes the entire image with a single label. An object detection model identifies and classifies individual objects or patterns within an image or video. For example, an image recognition model would simply return “cottage.” Using the same example, an object detection model would return other prominent objects in the image, for example thatch, house, cottage. 6 Common object recognition techniques Let’s explore the most common object recognition techniques used in computer vision. Often, they work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of objects within visual data. Once trained, the computer vision model can accurately recognize and classify objects based on their visual appearance and characteristics. Depending upon the application, different combinations or variations of techniques are used based on training requirements. Object detection: This technique locates and identifies multiple instances of objects within an image or video by drawing a bounding box around the objects of interest and providing a label or class for each bounding box. Object segmentation: Object segmentation separates individual objects within an image or video by assigning a pixel-level mask to each object. Each pixel is assigned a value or color code based on the object or class it corresponds to. This segmentation provides a more detailed understanding of the object’s boundaries and more precise object recognition. Object tracking: Object tracking involves following the movement of a specific object across frames in a video sequence. The goal of object tracking is to maintain a consistent association between the object being tracked and its representation in subsequent frames, even as the object changes, such as appearance, scale, orientation, and occlusion. It is useful in applications like video surveillance and autonomous vehicles. Object recognition and classification: This technique not only detects objects and understands their spatial location but also identifies and categorizes objects into predefined classes or categories. It involves training models to recognize specific objects based on their visual features and assigning them classes, such as cars, people, animals, or specific objects like chairs or cups. Pose estimation: Pose estimation infers the body joint positions and skeletal structure from images or videos. It estimates the pose of a person, including the positions and orientations of body parts, such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. Because it understands the pose or pose changes, it is useful in augmented reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction applications. Instance segmentation: This combines object detection and semantic segmentation techniques. It detects the presence and location of an object and then segments each object separately by providing both bounding box coordinates and pixel-level masks for each individual object instance in an image or video. Industry applications use cases for object detection Object detection is a key task for humans: when entering a new room or scene, our first instinct is to visually assess the objects and people it contains and then make sense of them. Similar to humans, object detection plays a crucial role in enabling computers to understand and interact with the visual world. Object recognition is used in many use cases across industries including: Workplace safety and security AI: Object detection models can help improve workplace safety and security. For example, they can detect the presence of suspicious individuals or vehicles in a sensitive area. More creatively, it can help ensure that workers are using personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, helmets, or masks. Media: Object detection models can help recognize the presence of certain brands, products, logos, or people in digital media. Advertisers can then use this information to collect metadata and show more relevant ads to users. It also helps automate the process of detecting and flagging inappropriate or prohibited content, such as explicit images, violence, hate speech, or other forms of harmful or offensive material. Social media sites rely on this type of content moderation to protect their community members and the integrity of their site. Manufacturing quality control: Object detection models enable automation of visual data review. Computers and cameras can analyze data real-time and automatically detect and process visual information and understand its significance which reduces the need for manual intervention in tasks where constant visual reviews are required. This is particularly beneficial for manufacturing production quality control . It not only enhances efficiency but also detects production anomalies that may go unnoticed by the human eye which prevent potential production disruption or product recalls. The importance of object detection in computer vision Object detection techniques are crucial in computer vision. These algorithms enable machines to understand, interpret, and make decisions based on visual data.

https://www.chooch.com/blog/what-is-computer-vision/,"What is Computer Vision | Chooch Computer Vision: Definition and working principle Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand and interpret visual information, just like humans do. By using complex algorithms and techniques, computer vision allows machines to analyze and interpret images or videos — recognizing objects, detecting and tracking movements, and even estimating depth and dimensions. Computer vision has become an essential technology in various applications such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, medical imaging, and even social media filters. What is computer vision? The origins of computer vision can be traced back to the 1950s when researchers first started exploring ways to mimic human vision using computational techniques. As technology advanced, so did the capabilities of computer vision systems. The introduction of more powerful hardware, such as GPUs, allowed for faster and more efficient processing of visual data. This, coupled with the development of sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques, enabled computer vision systems to tackle more complex tasks. One of the most significant advancements in recent years has been deep learning. Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks to automatically learn from vast amounts of data and uncover intricate patterns within it. It is critical in computer vision techniques involving pattern recognition, classification, regression, and other complex data analysis tasks. Let’s take a closer look at how computer vision works and these techniques. How computer vision works? Computer vision systems rely on a combination of hardware and algorithms to process visual data. By combining these steps, computer vision algorithms can detect objects, extract relevant features, and make sense of the visual information. Image acquisition: The process begins with capturing an image or video using cameras or other imaging devices. The quality and resolution of the images acquired influence the accuracy of subsequent computer vision tasks. Preprocessing: Once the data is captured, it undergoes preprocessing to clean up the images and adjusts them to make them easier to work with. This might involve removing noise, adjusting colors, and resizing images. Feature extraction: Lastly, the computer vision system identifies and extracts important parts of the images, for example color, texture, shape, edges, corners, or any other characteristic that helps the computer understand what is in the images. Let’s break down a few common scenarios that happen after feature extraction. The next steps typically involve using those extracted features to perform specific tasks, such as object recognition , classification, segmentation, or any other analysis you might be interested in. Types of computer vision techniques Action recognition : Identifies when a person is performing a given action (e.g., running, sleeping, falling, etc.). Image classification : Categorizes images into predefined classes or categories. The goal is to train a model to recognize and assign a label to an input image based on the features and patterns present in the image. Image recognition : Identifies the most important high-level contents of an image. For example, given an image of a soccer game, a computer vision model trained for image recognition might return simply “soccer game.” Image segmentation: Isolates the areas of interest, for example it can separate the foreground (objects of interest) from the background and assigns a category to each pixel in the image, grouping them together into objects, people, backgrounds, etc. Object tracking : Estimates the motion of objects between consecutive frames. Machine learning and neural networks : Extracted features often serve as input for machine learning models or deep neural networks. These models learn from the features to make predictions or decisions based on the data they’ve been trained on. Business impact of computer vision and challenges Computer vision technology is driving innovation across many industries and use cases and is creating unprecedented business applications and opportunities. It’s being used across all industries to address a broad and growing range of business applications. These include physical security, retail , automotive, robotics, healthcare , manufacturing , supply chain/logistics, government, media and entertainment, and Internet of Things (IoT). 2 major computer vision concerns As tools and services continue to drive down costs and improve performance and confidence in computer vision systems, there continues to be concerns around ethics and the lack of explainability of sophisticated approaches. Concerns surrounding privacy and data security continue to be paramount. Privacy The ability to capture, analyze, and store substantial amounts of visual data raises questions about who has access to this information and how it is used. Striking the right balance between the benefits of computer vision and protecting individual privacy is a critical consideration in moving forward. Bias Computer vision algorithms learn from data, and if the training data is biased, it can lead to biased outcomes. For example, facial recognition algorithms trained on predominantly male faces may struggle to correctly identify female faces. Addressing bias in computer vision algorithms is essential to avoid perpetuating existing societal biases and ensuring fair and ethical use of computer vision technology. What does the future hold for computer vision With the continuous advancements in technology and the increasing availability of large datasets, the future of computer vision looks promising. As computer vision systems become more sophisticated and capable, they have the potential to revolutionize various industries and reshape the way we interact with machines. Gartner predicts based on current trends and projections; computer vision will grow as a popular application for edge deployments – Edge Computer Vision . “By 2025, Gartner expects computer vision implementations leveraging edge architectures to increase to 60%, up from 20% in 2022.” Emerging Technologies: Computer Vision Is Advancing to Be Smarter, More Actionable and on the Edge, Gartner July 2022 How can Chooch help computer vision?
