speakerâs identity and affirms their consent to overdub synthesizing their voice. no other voice recording can be used for creation of an overdub voice. we train and host your artificial voice using google cloud . also, we use the audio that you shared as 'training audio' to improve our service. after your overdub voice is created, descript generates a series of non-defamatory samples using your overdub voice and shares them with amazon mechanical turk so an impartial human can listen to them and assess their quality. also, descript employees may listen to samples of your training or generated audio for quality assurance purposes. other than described above, only you and people you explicitly grant permission to will have access to generating synthesized audio using your overdub

(we wouldnât want you to think that this license lets you reprint coca-cola cans.) 3. limitations there are a few other limitations we have put in place to protect our artists and other customers: 1.â  	you cannot sell, license, or redistribute our stock files, nor can you build your own stock media site with our files. you cannot create a trademark or logo based on our stock files. you cannot use automation, such as computer scripts, to download or âscrapeâ high volumes of our stock files. finally, you cannot use the stock files to harm minors, to encourage violence, or for an unlawful purpose, such as defamation. 2.â  	for stock files that depict identifiable people (âmodelsâ), you must not depict the models in a way that a reasonable person would find offensive. just to be clear, the issue is whether the depiction of the models themselves is offensive, not whether your project as a whole may be offensive. for example, you could use stock files with models in a documentary about a rare and embarrassing medical condition, but you should not depict the models in a way that suggests they personally carry the condition, unless our video clip already depicts them that way. 3.â  	for our audio stock files, storyblocks has cleared all rights, including pro licenses, such that your license does not restrict your right of public performance, but a cue sheet may be required to satisfy the requirements of performance rights organizations (âprosâ). also, this license allowed you to use our audio clips in youtube videos, but since we are not associated with youtube, we cannot prevent other people from incorrectly claiming that your video violates a copyright. if you get such a claim, let us know, and we will make our best efforts to help you resolve the problem. still, platforms like youtube could block your content for reasons beyond our control. 4.â  	some stock files may have additional restrictions, such as âeditorial use only,â which will be noted in the clipâs details. 4. other legal provisions this part may not be fun to read, but itâs important nevertheless. 1.â  	this agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of delaware, excluding its body of law relating to conflicts of law and copyright law. if any provision of this agreement is found invalid, the other provisions will not be affected.â â except for claims brought in small claims court, all disputes about this agreement will be settled by arbitration pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association (âaaaâ), subject to the federal arbitration act. the dispute may be arbitrated either by jams or aaa. you are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. you are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court."

https://www.descript.com/use-case/vlogging,"should you use descript to edit your vlog? should you use descript for your vlog? last updated 10/20/20 hello vlogger! if youâre reading this, we assume itâs because youâre trying to decide if descript is the right tool for editing your vlog. instead of just giving you a sales pitch, weâve prepared a faq to help you determine if descript is right for you. our guidance will evolve as we ship more features, so please check back. and if you have questions that arenât covered here, let us know and weâll add them! â how is descript different from other video editors? â â the biggest difference is that when you record or import video, we transcribe it, and then you can edit the video by editing text. if you want to delete an outtake, just select the words in the script and delete them, and the video goes along for the ride. if you want to add an image, title, b-roll, or music, you just drag it into the script where you want it to appear. itâs really just like using a doc. descript also has a timeline editor, designed to be used in conjunction with the script, when you need to fine-tune clips or add transitions. you can even close the script view and use it like a traditional editor. â what are the main reasons to choose descript? itâs easy, fast, and fun . not only does descript bring editing within reach for people who arenât experienced with timeline editors, itâs just way faster to edit with descript, even if youâre a timeline editing pro. and because youâre not spending as much time futzing around with clips on a timeline, youâre spending more time in the creative part of your brain instead of the technical part. itâs really fun to use. itâs collaborative. descript is also the first audio/video editor that has google docs-style multi-user editing and commenting . while descript is a desktop app and it can run offline, when youâre online, everything is synced to the cloud, so you donât have to mess around with files and stuff. descript works the way you expect software to work in 2020 (but no other video editors do). we have some crazy features that no one else has. for example, you can remove all of your âumsâ and âuhsâ with a click . also you can create a clone of your voice and use it to make corrections to your voiceover without re-recording. or use that same voice clone to forgo recorded audio altogether and just type your entire voiceover. hereâs an example of a customer that did that: â â it also works with audio . descript is a new kind of editor thatâs equally at home making editing audio as it is with video. so if youâre thinking about, for example, making a podcast and a video from the same raw content, you can do that all with one tool. what are some reasons that descript might not be right for me? features . the biggest reason would be if we donât yet support a feature that you canât live without. descript has everything most vloggers need ã¼ non-destructive multitrack editing, titles, basic transitions, animation, 4k export, a screen recorder, subtitles, and more ã¼ but weâre not going to sit here and pretend you can make an avengers movie with it. yet! here are some things that we donât have right now: complex animated title sequences, color grading, visual transitions other than simple dissolves, chroma keying, clip speed, clip rotation. if those or other features are important to you, vote them up on our feedback board . your videos donât have a lot of speech in them. if you make instrumental music videos or something, you can do that with descript, but youâd just be closing the script view and using it like a normal timeline editor, so the upside isnât as big when compared against other video editors. maybe youâd still use descript because itâs collaborative? mobile. if you need to edit on a mobile phone, we donât do that right now. lots of people like adobe rush for mobile editing, so check that out if you havenât already. language. descript only works in english. can i use descript in conjunction with other editing tools? â â yes - you can do your initial edit in descript and then export to premiere or final cut pro. our timeline export feature preserves your clip edits and original files. this feature is popular with many of our customers who are more experienced video editors - they use descript because itâs so fast to do the initial cut, and then they export to another tool for final touches. â i still need help deciding! you should just download descript and noodle around. trying it out is free and, regardless of whether you decide to become a paying customer, thereâs nothing like it and using it will give you that make you feel like youâre in the future. so if you cultivate experiences like the first time you put on a vr headset, check it out for one of those. descript is a collaborative audio/video editor that works like a doc . it includes transcription, a screen recorder, publishing, and some mind-bendingly useful ai tools. capture screen recording transcription remote recording edit podcasting video editing overdub (text to speech) filler word removal share teams publishing social video subtitles squadcast is joining descript! get remote recording free. learn more â product tour features for work resources pricing sign in sign up"

great-looking videos often come with massive file size. in descript, you can troubleshoot this in two ways. one is to convert the video file into a video format that makes compressed videos look great (mp4 excels in this). or keep your video in the same file format but set the export settings to a lower overall resolution. the image could lose some of its crispness, but youâll preserve your video format at a smaller overall file size. what file types struggle to play natively in web browsers? you could be looking for an online video converter because you're running into issues playing your video natively in a web browser. that could be because itâs in a file format such as flv, wav, wmv, or avi. but youâre in luck, with descript you can convert from any of those to a format (mp4) that is more suitable for web browsers, for maximum user engagement â and for those all-important social shares. download the app for free create a podcast, a video, and all your social assets using descript. itâs as easy as editing a doc. sign up for free â learn more more articles and resources product updates the new overdub: hear the difference by brandon copple | october 18, 2021 video the importance of continuity editing in film and video by tiffani bauer | april 16, 2022 video what are video thumbnails?

using a very advanced (but benevolent) kind of artificial intelligence. descript research scientists (also benevolent) trained a computer model to recognize sounds that distract the human ear from speech â background noise, echo, reverb, and so on. then they taught it to create those sounds. and then they reversed the process, so it could learn to remove all the sound you donât want, leaving the stuff you do. thatâs a highly simplified version, but the rest is highly proprietary (plus, nobody understands it except the researchers). even if i admit thatâs kind of cool, why should i care? because studio sound enables you to record anywhere, on any microphone, and still come out of it with clean, crisp, high-quality audio. it solves one of the most vexing challenges creators face: how to deal with bad audio quality in post-production. why should i use your fancy studio sound thing? iâm a trained audio engineer. because it can save you enormous amounts of time. rather than spending a half hour carefully scrubbing out background sounds from the voiceover for your podcast or video, you can do it in a single click. then you can still adjust levels, add eq, and do all the other things you do to make audio sound amazing. weâre just helping you skip one of the most annoying parts. my voice sounds slightly unnatural after i apply studio sound. can i fix that? yes. in regenerating your voice studio sound may leave it sounding a little low (ironically, it may sound more like the voice you hear in your head than the voice you actually emit). the best way to address is this is by using the studio sound intensity dial. itâs preset at 100 by default. if youâre voice sounds weird, try reducing the intensity until it sounds normal or the background noise starts to leak in. how can i use it? on your podcast, vlog, tutorials, product demos, you name it. if you're an audio or video editor, studio sound can speed up your workflow on everything from audio editing to recording to scheduling â no more waiting until you or your guest can be in the perfect recording location. how do i get studio sound?

it depends on what you're uploading. rates between 30 and 60 frames per second (fps) are standard for live footage; the latter is perfect for high-quality, slow-motion replay. however, if you want it to look cinematic, 24 fps is what we see at the cinema. fun fact: in the old days, television looked different on either side of the atlantic, because europe and north america had distinct video formats. europeans enjoyed higher-definition tv because their pal system was 25 fps, while americans had to make do with ntsc's 29.97 fps. the pal system has more lines of resolution, so the quality is better. can i convert a 30 fps video to 60 fps? if you want to, you can use descript to increase your videoâs fps. but it adds extra frames that shouldnât be there, leaving you with larger file sizes and video that looks uncanny in playback. instead, try using the 60 fps converter the other way and make the footage play at a lower, more cinematic frame rate. is frame rate conversion free with descript?

resources pricing sign in sign up descript vs. camtasia workflows pricing summary descript: the best camtasia alternative while camtasia and descript share some recording and editing features, descriptâs ai-powered tools will save you a ton of editing time â and give you the power to make a professional-grade video, as easy as editing a doc. get started for free contact sales comparing descript vs. camtasia's features from automatic captions and filler-word removal to live collaboration, descript saves you hours of drudgery and gives you everything you need to make screencasts that engage and educate. camtasia automatic captions collaboration easy publishing filler word removal keyboard capture mouse capture picture-in-picture social clip generator stock media library studio-quality background removal text-based editing video with interactive featuresâ workflows why trained video pros and total newbies alike choose descript over camtasiaâ recording & video editing recording and adding b-rollâ camtasia and descript have comparable video recording tools: you can record your screen, webcam, microphone, and system audio in either. they both let you select which part of your screen to record, and both make it easy to add b-roll. the moment you stop recording though, descriptâs ai-powered editing will instantly start making your life easier. editing a mistake from your voiceover camtasia works like any traditional, timeline-based editing software. that means constant zooming in and out of the timeline, fiddling with waveforms, and scrubbing through the recording to find what you need. in descript you get an auto-generated transcript â then edit your video just like you would edit a doc. to cut part of your video, just select that text in the transcript and tap delete, and itâs gone. and you can find any clip or moment youâre looking for in seconds â just search the transcript like you would a doc. removing filler words in camtasia, like all legacy timeline editors, you have to manually cut filler words (âum,â âuhâ, âlikeâ, etc.). it can take hours. descriptâs automatic filler word detection, on the other hand, can find and highlight filler words, so you can remove them all, all at once, with a single click. descript will delete the words from your audio track and automatically crossfade the audio on either side, creating a pretty seamless edit â and save you a ton of time. recording pickups with camtasia, every mistake or omission in your audio will mean re-recording and splicing in the corrected version. itâs not only a hassle, it can create jarring discrepancies in the audio and video, as things like room tone and lighting shift between recordings. descript solves all these problems using generative ai. with overdub, you can create a text-to-speech clone of your voice, then fix audio mistakes or add new voiceover just by typing; overdub will match the tonal characteristics to make the new word blend right in. itâs vastly easier than re-recording. switching between screen & camera layouts changing layouts â e.g., from only your screen to only your face â is doable in camtasia, but tricky. every time you want to switch, youâll have to do it manually, using layers and the blade tool, from scratch â even if youâre using the same few layouts over and over. descript makes it way simpler. just record your screen and your webcam in the descript editor; descript will capture them as separate tracks. to change layouts you just set up each layout as a scene by typing a slash, then right click to copy your layout, and just paste it each time you want to use it. organization exporting & video hostingâ only descript lets you publish a shareable web page, where collaborators and colleagues can watch the video, see the transcript, and leave comments. collaboration in descript, collaboration works like google docs. so you can share the video without downloading, and colleagues can see edits and updates just by refreshing the page. file management & version control only descript constantly saves your files to the cloud. that means you donât have to worry about saving constantly to avoid losing changes. and you can see and revert to previous versions. ai tools & editing features green screen remove your background with a click, then put yourself in any setting you can imagine. studio sound descriptâs ai-powered voice-regeneration tool will make even the lowest-quality audio sound like it was recorded in a studio. text-based editing descript makes trimming a screen recording (or any video) as easy as editing a doc. pricing comparing descript vs. camtasia's pricing to get everything you get in descript, youâd have to buy a subscription to camtasia (for recording and editing), audiate (for transcription services), and pay for access to camtasiaâs asset library. that doesnât include camtasia support beyond your first year. descript pro gives you all that functionality at less than half the cost a descript pro subscription gives you full access to all descriptâs features, stock media library, and ai editing

best screencast tool? camtasia is a handy tool, but descript does everything camtasia does, and arms you with these incredibly useful ai-powered tools, for less than half the cost. thatâs why the overall winner is descript. the screen recording options may be mostly the same, but thatâs the easy part of making video. as soon as you stop recording, descript makes it easier to make a better
