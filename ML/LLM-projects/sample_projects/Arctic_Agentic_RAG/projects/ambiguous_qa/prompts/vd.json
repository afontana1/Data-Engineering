      "disambiguation": "Who has the highest goals all-time in football?",
      "passage": "FIFA, the international governing body of football, has never released a list detailing the highest goalscorers and does not keep official records; in 2020, it recognised Bican, an Austrian-Czech dual international who played between the  and the , as the record scorer with an estimated 805 goals, although CNN, the BBC, France 24, and O Jogo all acknowledge that Bican's tally includes goals scored for reserve teams and in unofficial international matches. UEFA, the governing body for European football, ranks him as the leading all-time goalscorer in European top-flight leagues with 518 goals, narrowly ahead of Hungarian Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s. The RSSSF credits Bican with 948 goals, a tally which includes goals scored in winter tournaments, as well as when selected to represent regional and city teams, and the Football Association of the Czech Republic claims a total of 821. Spanish newspapers Marca and Sport state that both Bican and Pel\u00e9 scored 762 goals. Such is the difficulty for statisticians and media outlets to determine which goals to include that the topic has spurred controversy; Bican once walked out of a gala held in his honour by the IFFHS after the organisation had excluded war-time goals from his tally, although it later recognised 229 goals he had scored during the period.",
      "question": "highest goals world football",
      "reason": "The original question is ambiguous because 'highest goals in world football' could refer to various contexts, such as official matches, all-time goals including unofficial games, or goals in specific leagues. The passage provides different figures from multiple sources, but the most consistent recognition for the all-time highest goalscorer points to Bican."

The generated question must be a clear and unambiguous disambiguation of the original query, explicitly clarifying intent.\n2. The question must be fully answerable using only the information in the given passage. If the passage is not self-contained, respond with \"null\".\n3. The question must be a direct inquiry about the information in the passage, without referencing the passage itself. Avoid meta-questions that refer to the passage explicitly, such as \"Based on the provided context...\" or \"What is not mentioned about X in the passage?\".\n4. For time-sensitive questions, provide the clearest possible time reference. Avoid ambiguous phrasing such as \"Which country has won the most recent World Cup?\" since the answer depends on when the question is asked.\n"
