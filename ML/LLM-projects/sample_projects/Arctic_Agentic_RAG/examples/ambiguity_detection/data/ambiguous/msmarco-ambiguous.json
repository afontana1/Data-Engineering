      "DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is a molecule that carries genetic instructions for the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms. DNA is structured as a double helix, resembling a twisted ladder, where base pairs (adenine with thymine, and cytosine with guanine) form the rungs. This code determines an organism's traits and is passed from parents to offspring.",
      "DNA testing analyzes genetic material to provide insights into ancestry, health risks, traits, and family connections. Popular tests, like those for ancestry, compare DNA with databases to estimate ethnic backgrounds or find relatives. Health-related DNA tests can highlight genetic predispositions to certain conditions. Tests are usually done by swabbing the inside of the cheek or through a saliva sample, and results are typically available within a few weeks.",
      "\"DNA\" is a hit song by the South Korean boy band BTS, released in 2017 on their album Love Yourself: Her. The song explores themes of love and connection, symbolizing that some relationships are \"destined\" or \"meant to be,\" as if written into one's DNA. The song blends EDM with pop, featuring energetic choreography and vibrant visuals, and was pivotal in helping BTS gain global recognition."
