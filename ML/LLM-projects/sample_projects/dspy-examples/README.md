# DSPy AI Program Examples

This repository contains a collection of example AI programs built using DSPy and maitained by the Langtrace AI team.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: The top-level directory containing all examples.
  - Each subdirectory within `src/` represents a distinct example.
    - Within each example directory, you'll find one or more program folders.

## Program Structure

Each program folder typically includes the following files:

- `dataset`: Contains the data used by the program.
- `program.py`: The main program logic.
- `signatures.py`: Defines the signatures used in the program.
- `run.py`: The entry point for executing the program.

## Compound Systems

Some examples may consist of multiple DSPy programs working together as a compound system. In such cases, you'll find multiple program folders within a single example directory.

## Getting Started

To run an example:

1. Navigate to the desired program folder.
2. Execute the `run.py` file.
