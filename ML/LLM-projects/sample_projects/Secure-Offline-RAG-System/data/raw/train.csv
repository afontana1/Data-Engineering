Additionally, the Administrator associates the group ID (GID) with the key set (K) by writing an entry to the GroupKeyMap list attribute. Once the key material is distributed and associated with the Node, the Node subscribes to the IPv6 multicast address generated from the fabric ID and group ID. Finally, the Administrator associates the endpoint with the group ID (GID) by sending the AddGroup command to the endpoint. This process ensures that the newly commissioned Node has access to the necessary key material and is seamlessly integrated into the group communication network, enabling secure communication with other group members."

The process begins with the Administrator generating a fabric-unique group ID (GID) and a random key (key0) for the group key set ID (K). Subsequently, the Administrator writes the group key set (K) to the remote Node, known as the GroupMember, using the KeySetWrite command. Additionally, the Administrator associates the group ID (GID) with the key set (K) by writing an entry to the GroupKeyMap list attribute. Once the key material is distributed and associated with the Node, the Node subscribes to the IPv6 multicast address generated from the fabric ID and group ID. Finally, the Administrator associates the endpoint with the group ID (GID) by sending the AddGroup command to the endpoint. This process ensures that the newly commissioned Node has access to the necessary key material and is seamlessly integrated into the group communication network, enabling secure communication with other group members."
