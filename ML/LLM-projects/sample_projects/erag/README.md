# ERAG 

## Overview

You can use this application to:

1. Talk **privately** with your documents using Ollama or talk **fast** using Groq and others.
2. Perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation activities (**RAG**) using various APIs (Ollama, LLaMA, Groq, Gemini, Cohere). 
3. Perform AI powered **web search**.
4. Talk with a **specific url**.
5. Analyze and summarize **GitHub** repositories.
6. Do AI powered Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**) with AI generated Business Intelligence and insights on excels and csv (see some examples in images below). 
7. Utilize multiple AI models in **collaboration** (worker, supervisor, manager) for pre-defined complex tasks.
8. Generate specific knowledge entries (knol), or generate full size textbooks or use AI generated questions and answers to create datasets.


Thus, ERAG is an advanced system that combines lexical, semantic, text, and knowledge graph searches with conversation context to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. This tool processes various document types, creates embeddings, builds knowledge graphs, and uses this information to answer user queries intelligently. It also includes modules for interacting with web content, GitHub repositories, performing exploratoru data analysis using various language models.

8. **Inconsistent Capitalization**
   - Identifies inconsistent use of uppercase, lowercase, or title case in text columns.

9. **Possible Data Truncation**
   - Checks for values that are close to the maximum observed length in a column, which might indicate truncation.

10. **High Frequency Values**
    - Identifies values that appear with unusually high frequency (>90%) in a column.

11. **Suspicious Date Range**
    - Checks for dates outside a reasonable range (e.g., before 1900 or far in the future).

12. **Large Numeric Range**
    - Detects numeric columns with an unusually large range of values.

13. **Very Short Strings**
    - Identifies strings that are unusually short (less than 2 characters).

14. **Very Long Strings**

18. **Date Inconsistency**
    - Verifies logical relationships between date columns (e.g., start date before end date).

19. **Logical Relationship Violations**
    - Checks for violations of expected relationships between columns (e.g., a total column should equal the sum of its parts).

20. **Pattern Mismatch**
    - Verifies if values in certain columns match expected patterns (e.g., phone numbers, zip codes, URLs).

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Check console output for detailed error messages (color-coded for easier identification).
- Verify API keys and tokens are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- For performance issues, adjust chunk sizes, batch processing parameters, or consider using a GPU.
- If using local LLaMA.cpp servers, ensure the correct model files are available and properly configured.
