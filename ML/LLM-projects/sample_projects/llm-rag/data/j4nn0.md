# J4NN0

During one of his League of Legends games, hew was playing with a friend, and he was playing Janna. He was playing so well that a friend started calling him J4NN0. Since then, he has kept this nickname. 

This is of course a joke, but it was suggested by GitHub Copilot while I was generating this document. I found it funny and I accepted it.
