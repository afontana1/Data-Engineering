For example, an unsupported configuration of cublasLtMatmul with the scale type being FP32 and all other types being FP16 would run with the implicit assumption that the scale type is FP16 which can produce incorrect results. This will be fixed in an upcoming release. * Resolved Issues cublasLtMatmul ignored the CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_AMAX_D_POINTER for unsupported configurations instead of returning an error. In particular, computing absolute maximum of D is currently supported only for FP8 Matmul when the output data type is also FP8 (CUDA_R_8F_E4M3 or CUDA_R_8F_E5M2). Reduced host-side overheads for some of the cuBLASLt APIs: cublasLtMatmul(), cublasLtMatmulAlgoCheck(), and cublasLtMatmulAlgoGetHeuristic(). The issue was introduced in CUDA Toolkit 12.4. cublasLtMatmul() and cublasLtMatmulAlgoGetHeuristic() could have resulted in floating point exceptions (FPE) on some Hopper-based GPUs, including Multi-Instance GPU (MIG). The issue was introduced in cuBLAS 11.8. Resolved Issues'),\n",

See Table 3. For more information various GPU products that are CUDA capable, visit https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus. Each release of the CUDA Toolkit requires a minimum version of the CUDA driver. The CUDA driver is backward compatible, meaning that applications compiled against a particular version of the CUDA will continue to work on subsequent (later) driver releases. More information on compatibility can be found at https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#cuda-compatibility-and-upgrades. Note: Starting with CUDA 11.0, the toolkit components are individually versioned, and the toolkit itself is versioned as shown in the table below. The minimum required driver version for CUDA minor version compatibility is shown below.

Performance of SIMD Integer CUDA Math APIs was improved. * Resolved Issues The __hisinf() Math APIs from cuda_fp16.h and cuda_bf16.h headers were silently producing wrong results if compiled with the -std=c++20 compiler option because of an underlying nvcc compiler issue, resolved in version 12.3. Resolved Issues * The __hisinf() Math APIs from cuda_fp16.h and cuda_bf16.h headers were silently producing wrong results if compiled with the -std=c++20 compiler option because of an underlying nvcc compiler issue, resolved in version 12.3. The __hisinf() Math APIs from cuda_fp16.h and cuda_bf16.h headers were silently producing wrong results if compiled with the -std=c++20 compiler option because of an underlying nvcc compiler issue, resolved in version 12.3. * Known Issues Users of cuda_fp16.h and cuda_bf16.h headers are advised to disable host compilers strict aliasing rules based optimizations (e.g. pass -fno-strict-aliasing to host GCC compiler) as these may interfere with the type-punning idioms used in the __half, __half2, __nv_bfloat16, __nv_bfloat162 types implementations and expose the user program to undefined behavior. Note, the headers suppress GCC diagnostics through: #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored -Wstrict-aliasing. This behavior may improve in future versions of the headers.

CUDA MATH: RELEASE 12.2\\uf0c1 * New Features CUDA Math APIs for __half and __nv_bfloat16 types received usability improvements, including host side <emulated> support for many of the arithmetic operations and conversions. __half and __nv_bfloat16 types have implicit conversions to/from integral types, which are now available with host compilers by default. These may cause build issues due to ambiguous overloads resolution. Users are advised to update their code to select proper overloads.

NVIDIA recommends that all developers requiring strict IEEE754 compliance update to CUDA Toolkit 12.2 or newer. The affected algorithm was present in both offline compilation as well as just-in-time (JIT) compilation. As JIT compilation is handled by the driver, NVIDIA recommends updating to driver version greater than or equal to R535 (R536 on Windows) when IEEE754 compliance is required and when using JIT.
