Are womens getting equal opportunities in AI Innovation?,"[Source: https://www.ey.com/en_in/health/how-to-ensure-that-a-time-of-great-crisis-becomes-a-time-for-great-innovation]

Hello! Thank you for your question. 

When it comes to equal opportunities for women in AI innovation, the landscape is complex and evolving. While there have been significant strides towards gender equality in the tech industry, including AI, disparities still exist. 

### Current State of Opportunities for Women in AI

1. **Representation**: Women are underrepresented in AI and tech fields. According to various studies, women make up a smaller percentage of the workforce in AI compared to men. This underrepresentation can be attributed to a variety of factors, including societal norms, educational pathways, and workplace cultures.

2. **Initiatives and Programs**: Many organizations and institutions are actively working to bridge this gap. Initiatives such as mentorship programs, scholarships, and workshops specifically aimed at women in tech are becoming more common. These programs are designed to encourage more women to enter and thrive in the field of AI.

3. **Corporate Policies**: Companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion. Policies that promote equal opportunities, such as unbiased recruitment processes, flexible working conditions, and support for work-life balance, are being implemented to attract and retain female talent in AI.

4. **Challenges**: Despite these efforts, challenges remain. Women in AI often face issues such as gender bias, lack of role models, and limited access to networks and resources. These challenges can hinder their career progression and innovation potential.

### Moving Forward

To ensure that women get equal opportunities in AI innovation, continuous efforts are needed from all stakeholders, including educational institutions, corporations, and policymakers. Encouraging young girls to pursue STEM education, providing platforms for women to showcase their work, and fostering an inclusive culture in workplaces are crucial steps towards achieving gender equality in AI.

In conclusion, while progress is being made, there is still a long way to go to ensure that women have equal opportunities in AI innovation. Continuous efforts and commitment from all sectors of society are essential to create a more inclusive and diverse AI landscape.

I hope this provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of opportunities for women in AI innovation. If you have any more questions or need further information, feel free to ask!

(PDF)\n\n7 MB\n\nEnterprises are increasingly looking to leverage new technologies like 5G and IoT to deliver their ESG goals.\n\nIn brief\n\nSeventy-six percent of enterprises believe that emerging technologies can play a critical role in reducing their organization’s carbon emissions.\n\nESG is most likely to feature as a leading consideration in 5G and IoT investment, and companies investing in these areas already see a range of benefits.\n\nSustainability capabilities and credentials are the top attributes that organizations will seek in their technology vendors in the future.\n\nCompanies increasingly see 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT) and emerging technologies as driving their sustainability efforts, with greater efficiency, improved measurement, and virtual products and processes ranking high on the list of benefits.\n\nThat’s a key theme emerging from the latest EY Reimagining Industry Futures Study, which explores attitudes and intentions around 5G, IoT and other emerging technologies expressed by executives from 1,325 enterprises worldwide across an array of industries.\n\nAbove is a data visualization ""story"" consisting of two donut charts. The first shows that 76% of respondents believe emerging technologies can play a critical role in reducing their organization’s carbon emissions. The second shows that 74% of respondents believe the environmental impact of new technologies is an important consideration in their organization\'s digital transformation plans.\n\nHow EY can help\n\nESG and sustainability\n\nEY teams can help address ESG and sustainability issues, investor concerns and improve ESG performance. Find out how.\n\n\n\nThe EY CIO Imperative Series is designed to provide critical answers and actions to reframe the future of your organization. In this article, we discuss how the results of this study show an important convergence between enterprises’ technology and sustainability strategies across six dimensions.\n\n1. Enterprises view emerging technologies as positive drivers of sustainability\n\nFifty-four percent of the enterprises we surveyed believe emerging technologies can play a vital role in accelerating their business’s progress on sustainability. A further 41% believe these technologies can play a largely positive role but also present some risks. This awareness of potential downsides reflects current research that estimates information and communication technology (ICT) in its entirety accounts for 1.8% to 2.8% of greenhouse gas emissions and an even higher proportion of electricity consumption.1\n\nInterestingly, Asia-based enterprises are the most likely to highlight the vital role of emerging technologies (62%), while European businesses are the most likely to say their positive impact is accompanied by some risks (49%). This regional variation may reflect European policymakers’ historical focus on the energy consumption risks posed by data centers and cloud technologies.2\n\nAbove is a bar chart (stacked %) describing by region the respondents\' views of emerging technologies’ impact on the sustainable enterprise. Respondents were asked: Which of the following best describes your view of how emerging technologies could impact your organization\'s long-term sustainability?\n\nThe chart\'s complete data is in the table below:\n\nRegion They can play a vital role in accelerating sustainability They could play a largely positive role in enabling sustainability, but also presents some risks Their detrimental impact would outweigh their positive impact on sustainability I\'m unsure what kind of role they will play for my organization\'s sustainability strategy Global 54 41 4 1 Americas 59 38 3 0 Asia 61 31 7 1 Europe 45 49 4 2\n\n2. The sustainability upside of new technologies covers a range of dimensions\n\nRespondents see emerging technologies as providing a range of positive contributions to long-term sustainability strategies. Reduced energy consumption tops the list, followed by improved measurement and planning, and reduced production of waste. The shift to virtual services and workforce tools also features prominently.\n\nOther benefits are less prominent, with only about a quarter of respondents highlighting the positive impacts on circular business models and the adoption of renewable energy sources — suggesting these could be areas that will need greater focus in the future from the CIO community. The range of positive outcomes, however, underlines the multi-sided potential of emerging technologies from a sustainability perspective.\n\nAbove is a column chart (grouped) describing 5G and IoT\'s impact on organizations’ sustainability strategies. Respondents were asked: How is your organization\'s current investment in 5G and IoT benefitting your organization\'s long-term sustainability strategy?\n\nThe chart\'s complete data is in the table below:\n\nBenefit Percentage Improve sustainability planning and forecasting 55 Reduce energy consumption 51 Increase labor productivity 48 Provide virtual products and services portfolio 46 Improve visibility of supply chain or suppliier emissions 45 Improve measurement of organization\'s environmental impact 43 Provide virtual workforce tools and processes 39 Enable circular business models 38 Accelerate adoption of renewable energy sources 37 Reduce production of waste 37 Increase levels of recycling 36\n\nPercentage of respondents, n = 194 (enterprises currently investing in 5G and IoT)\n\n3. ESG is a major investment consideration in emerging technology investments – especially 5G\n\nLooking across all emerging technologies, 35% of our survey respondents view ESG as a leading consideration when making investment decisions, with another 41% viewing it as important. 5G investments are the most likely to involve ESG as an important principle, followed closely by IoT.\n\nConversely, augmented reality, blockchain, and quantum computing investment decisions are less likely to involve ESG. A quarter of respondents, for example, cite ESG as a minor consideration when investing in blockchain. Given bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — which rely on blockchain — are attracting high levels of ESG-related scrutiny from regulators and policymakers, such as the European Commission, some realignment of priorities in the future seems likely.\n\nAbove is a bar chart (stacked %) describing ESG considerations in emerging tech investment. Respondents were asked: How do ESG considerations inform your investment plans or decisions in emerging technologies?\n\nThe chart\'s complete data is in the table below:\n\nTechnology Leading Important Minor Do not Unsure Average 35 41 19 4 1 5G 47 34 14 4 1 AI 40 39 18 2 1 Robo 37 42 18 2 1 IoT 42 36 18 3 1 Edge 34 42 19 4 1 AR 28 46 20 5 1 Quantum 26 47 22 4 1 Block 28 42 25 4 1\n\n4. 5G and IoT are already benefiting enterprise sustainability strategies\n\nThe ESG implications of 5G and IoT tend to have greater weight in enterprises’ investment decisions than those of other emerging technologies. When businesses investing in these two technologies are asked about their sustainability benefits, their responses are instructive: they are more likely to already see current benefits compared with the broader sample of enterprises asked about the potential benefits of emerging technologies at large.\n\nAs a result, many of the ESG benefits associated with emerging technologies as a whole are even more clearly linked to 5G and IoT. Over half (55%) of businesses currently investing in 5G and IoT say they’re helping to improve sustainability planning and forecasting, compared with 39% who believe the same could be true of emerging technologies at large. And 48% cite the productivity benefits of 5G and IoT, against just 22% for emerging technologies more broadly.\n\nAbove is a column chart (grouped) describing emerging technologies’ perceived impact on sustainability strategies. Respondents were asked: How can the adoption of emerging technologies (e.g., AI, automation, 5G, IoT) benefit your organization\'s long-term sustainability strategy?\n\nThe chart\'s complete data is in the table below:\n\nBenefit Percentage Reduce energy consumption 46 Improve sustainability planning and forecasting 39 Reduce production of waste 39 Improve measurement of organization\'s environmental impact 39 Improve visibility of supply chain or suppliier emissions 38 Increase levels of recycling 37 Provide virtual workforce tools and processes 36 Provide virtual products and services 36 Enable circular business models 27 Accelerate adoption of renewable energy sources 25\n\nPercentage of respondents who believe that emerging technology can play a vital or largely positive role in sustainability, n = 1259\n\n5. Sustainability imperatives are reshaping attitudes to technology suppliers and industry ecosystems\n\nAs sustainability becomes ever more central to CIOs’ technology strategies, the attributes that enterprises are seeking in their technology suppliers are changing. Over three-quarters of enterprises say they’ll prioritize vendors that can articulate the environmental impact of emerging technologies. Businesses also believe that vendors need to do more to reflect sustainability in their service portfolios: many don’t think the 5G and IoT use cases on offer sufficiently address their sustainability needs.\n\nAbove is a data visualization ""story"" consisting of two donut charts. The first shows that 77% of respondents will prioritize vendors that can articulate the environmental impact of emerging technologies. The second shows that 47% of respondents believe 5G and IoT use cases offered by vendors do not adequately address their organization’s sustainability needs.\n\nThese views are mirrored in the attributes that enterprises are seeking in their technology suppliers. Today, speed of deployment and execution tops the list, followed by end-to-end solution capabilities, with sustainability capabilities and credentials coming in third. But in the future, sustainability capabilities and credentials are the number one attribute enterprises say they will seek.\n\nAbove is a data visualization describing ESG considerations in emerging tech investment. Respondents were asked: What are the most important attributes sought in your ICT vendors now vs. in future?\n\nBelow is the data on the rankings:\n\nAttribute Now In future Speed of deployment and execution 1 6 End-to-end solution capabilities 2 3 Sustainability capabilities and credentials 3 1 Professional services capabilities 4 7 Competitive pricing or model 5 2 Breadth of service offering 8 5 Professional services capabilities 3 4\n\nHow EY can help\n\nIot Consulting Services\n\nDiscover how EY\'s IoT consulting services can help your business effectively capitalize on IoT technology and solutions.\n\n\n\nEcosystem strategies designed to help access new skills and competencies through collaboration with suppliers and other organizations will also be able to deliver sustainability advantages. Eighty percent of enterprises agree that collaborating with other organizations and industries on circular business models will become much more important in the next five years.\n\n6. Not all industries think alike about sustainability and emerging technologies\n\nWhen respondents are asked for their perceptions of emerging technologies’ sustainability benefits, marked differences in energy efficiency and circularity expectations emerge at the sector level. While reduced energy consumption tops the list across all industries, the proportion citing this benefit ranges from 54% in automotive to only 38% in health care. Similarly, reduced waste production is highlighted by 50% of executives in manufacturing but only 35% in government organizations.\n\nAbove is a filtered bar chart (stacked) that describes the perceived benefits of emerging technologies on sustainability strategies: industry split. Respondents were asked: How can the adoption of emerging technologies (e.g., AI, automation, 5G, IoT) benefit your organization\'s long-term sustainability strategy?\n\nThe chart\'s complete data is in the table below. The repetition is owing to the filtering of the results in a drop-down menu, part of the visualization\'s animation.\n\nIncome Entity Reduce energy consumption Improve measurement of organization\'s environmental impact Improve visibility of supplier or supply chain emissions Reduce energy consumption Automotive 54 Technology 49 Financial services 49 Manufacturing 48 Government 46 Consumer 41 Energy 40 Healthcare 38 Improve measurement of organization\'s environmental impact Government 44 Healthcare 44 Financial services 41 Energy 39 Technology 39 Manufacturing 38 Automotive 33 Consumer 32 Improve visibility of supplier or supply chain emissions Manufacturing 46 Energy 45 Technology 39 Financial services 39 Automotive 36 Government 34 Healthcare 33 Consumer 30\n\nPercentage of respondents who believe that emerging technologies can play a vital or largely positive role in sustainability (n = 1259)\n\nGovernment and healthcare (both 44%) are the most likely to cite emerging technologies’ positive impact on measuring their organizations’ environmental impact. However, assessing their suppliers’ environmental impact — ever more important given the need to report Scope 3 emissions — is regarded as relatively less important in government and healthcare but as a major benefit among manufacturing and energy respondents. While industries are alive to the potential for emerging technologies to help measure performance and progress, the breadth of their ambition — whether their focus is on their own organization or extends to accommodate their supply chain — differs.\n\nConclusion and next steps\n\nESG considerations are already feeding into businesses’ technology investment decisions, and sustainability needs are set to become a dominant factor in their technology vendor choices. So far, so good. Yet CIOs can do more to help ensure that high levels of expectation translate into long-term value creation:\n\n1. Prioritize emerging technologies and the sustainable benefits they can deliver\n\nWhile organizations are alive to a range of sustainability benefits unlocked by new technologies, it is critical that technology leaders focus their ambitions. Technology leaders should prioritize and phase the key ESG outcomes they are seeking and decide upon the optimal technologies that can deliver them, taking care to explore the combined impact of different technologies.\n\n2. Build a robust framework to evaluate the environmental implications of your emerging technology strategy\n\nEvaluate the carbon intensity and energy efficiency of your portfolio of emerging technologies and ensure your framework clearly links to overarching targets relating to reduced IT energy consumption across your organization. Take care to assess how migration to newer technologies and standards can enhance sustainability across your organization’s technology estate.\n\n3. Work with your leadership team to ensure that technology considerations inform all aspects of your organization’s sustainability agenda\n\nClose collaboration with other leadership roles and functions will help ensure that the role of new technologies in accelerating ESG goals is understood by all parts of your organization. This will help ensure that existing digital transformation roadmaps remain fit-for-purpose as sustainable principles become an increasingly important driver of them.\n\n4. Ensure that sustainability is a guiding principle of your technology supplier and ecosystem relationships\n\nCIOs are already prioritizing sustainability capabilities as attributes they seek in technology vendors. Building on this, it is vital that organizations put sustainability at the heart of their dialogue with their broader partner ecosystems. While technology investment decisions and vendor choices are already made with sustainability in mind, there is scope for greater collaboration on circular business models and shared ESG commitments going forward.\n\n5. Target emerging technology use cases that are sustainable by design\n\nMany businesses already have long-standing IoT initiatives, and these are increasingly complemented by the fast-growing adoption of 5G and edge computing. Use cases and deployment models should have sustainable outcomes built in.

The true value lies in embedding analytics deeply into business processes at the point where decisions are made – by human beings.\n\n\n\nConsulting\n\nData and decision intelligence\n\nAI\n\nEmerging technology\n\nThe team\n\nWhat EY can do for you\n\nCompanies don’t have analytics problems; they have business problems that analytics can address. EY aims to help the clients become intelligent, information-driven organizations, where fact-based decision-making is embedded into daily operations from the boardroom to the front line, which ultimately leads to better processes and outcomes.\n\nEY helps you demystify the language of analytics, demonstrating how insights can fuel confident, fact-based decisions. We help you build the structures and processes that convert data into a strategic asset, aligning data capture and analytics within critical streams of the organization. And we help you identify hidden performance drivers in both traditional and nontraditional data functions, from operations to customer experience, talent and HR, marketing and more.\n\nWe harness artificial intelligence (AI), automation and predictive capabilities to streamline processes and navigate the future. We equip you with the big-picture insights and new thinking that allow you to act decisively in solving challenges, seizing opportunities and sparking innovative growth.\n\nOur services help you to:\n\nNew technologies and market entrants, changing customer needs and behaviors, and exponentially growing data volumes create a need for change. Yet many finance functions continue to struggle with cumbersome processes, nonintegrated systems and a heterogeneous structure.\n\nAnalytics can help you to:\n\nMonitor performance management\n\nReduce the costs of finance\n\nSpeed up financial systems\n\nAlign people capabilities\n\nAnticipate financial risks\n\nWhile analytics has created substantial benefits for businesses and consumers alike, there are corresponding risks that go along with it. The need to secure sensitive data, to protect private information and to manage data quality exists whether data sets are big or small. However, the specific properties of big data create new types of risks that necessitate a comprehensive strategy that allows a company to utilize analytics while avoiding the pitfalls.\n\nAnalytics can help you to:\n\nImprove risk and internal audit processes and enable the business to deliver even better products and services\n\nEnable the risk and internal audit functions to provide business insights and act as a strategic advisor while reducing costs\n\nSimplify regulatory processes and improve quality\n\nDetect the next threat\n\nTechnology has empowered consumers to be smarter, better informed and more demanding than ever. They are adept at filtering information and move effortlessly between channels, and they expect value and quality in return for their money as well as personalized offers that match up with their needs. Whatever the sector, businesses face stiff competition. By analyzing sales data at a customer level and integrating it with competitor information and market events, machine-learning algorithms can unearth hidden insights about customer behavioral patterns that allow you to reposition, restructure and better focus your efforts on profitability and growth.\n\nAnalytics can help you to:\n\nAttract and retain the right customers\n\nUnlock the full value of existing customers\n\nOptimize your channel mix\n\nThe usage of advanced modeling and reporting tools will help you make optimized, data-driven decisions on allocating human resources and to forecast future service demand. Analytics helps you to optimize resource planning as well as better understand your employees, which in turn will support you in achieving superior performance while reducing costs.\n\nAnalytics can help you to:\n\nGain employee insight\n\nOptimize resource allocation\n\nTraditional supply chain models are shifting and require you to adapt to the new realities, requiring sophisticated, connected tools to drive optimal performance; enable better operational decision-making; monitor risks; predict disruptions; and support rapid recovery as part of an overall supply chain strategy. This requires companies to increase their adoption of advanced tools grounded in analytics and visualization to help improve operational efficiency across their end-to-end value chain and meet customer demand.\n\nAnalytics can help you to:\n\nAchieve operational excellence\n\nOptimize productivity\n\nReduce costs\n\nThe EY Client Technology Platform combines market-leading proprietary technologies with advanced analytics capabilities and deep industry sector knowledge.

Coming from a middle-class family, his mother worked for the railways and his father worked with a pharmaceuticals firm. Rajiv considers himself fortunate for receiving a good education at a convent school with great teachers, some of whom changed the course of his life. It was during his college days, deeply inspired by his brother-in-law who was a Chartered Accountant and worked for a Big Four, that Rajiv decided to pursue a CA degree.\n\nBeginning of the EY journey\n\nRajiv started his career with the prestigious mid-sized firm called Mahajan & Aibara as an article intern. His stint at EY began in 2001, when he got the opportunity to work with the management assurance services practice, now known as business advisory services, which was starting up at that time. As soon as the results of his CA exams came, he was promoted to an associate within three months. “I was thrilled when I got the joining letter. It was a big moment in my life,” he reminisces. That led to the beginning of Rajiv’s EY journey, which he refers to as one of the fondest and the most enriching ones of his career.\n\nThe EY experience - from mundane to the magnificent\n\nAt EY, Rajiv’s experience straddled across many areasꟷ from process audit to integrated IP audit, process advisory, consulting, business advisory, firm cost reduction, market assessment commercial strategyꟷ during his 10-year stint. He saw the firm scale up and grow relentlessly. He remembers his decade long journey with EY as a great learning experience. From mundane to the magnificent, is how he describes his initial EY experience. In his initial days he got a chance to do everything from physical verification, to cost reduction and process improvement assignments. He remembers doing assignments across sectors including steel, FMCG, advertising, core manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals.\n\n“At EY, we were always pushing the barriers of excellence”, he added.\n\nOf fond memories and relationships at EY\n\nRajiv recollects working with a very closely-knit group, like a family. When he joined the firm, his practice had about 30 people. By the time he left, the firm had scaled up and there were over 3,000 people in the practice with over 10,000 people in the firm. Rajiv used to work at EY’s Nariman Point – Express Towers office. He has very fond memories of breaking bread with his friends at EY. One of the things that Rajiv really misses about his EY experience is traveling across India and the world. “I got to meet so many people across cultures with different perspectives and it really broadened my horizon” he cherishes. He also got a chance to work in the US for the ‘India Advantage Program’ and served many large clients. At the same time, Rajiv saw a lot of growth and potential in India and decided to come back.\n\nTalking about how the EY experience shaped him, “EY had a very rigorous work ethic. The experience with the firm really shaped me in terms of structured thinking, attention to detail, and root cause analysis. There was a strong focus on excellence and every assignment was about delivering value to the client”. According to Rajiv, EY has the most amazing client services, which includes understanding client issues and trying to view solutions that matter to the client. “I am fortunate to have learnt all these skills from the stellar professionals that I worked with at the firm”, he added.\n\nMoving on from EY – the second phase of his career\n\nIn 2011, Rajiv realized that he had enjoyed doing a variety of work at EY and was desirous of adding more value from the other side of the table i.e. getting industry experience. That is when his stint at Lupin, a global pharmaceutical company, began where he spent close to nine years. Rajiv knew and had worked with Ramesh Swaminathan, CFO, Lupin who provided him the opportunity to join the organization. He mentored Rajiv and gave him the guidance and freedom at work to achieve newer heights. Rajiv joined Lupin as the Head of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations and subsequently led the business finance group. According to him, Lupin was a very fulfilling and different part of his professional career, as he got to experience the business from the perspective of the management and the investor community. He saw the company scale up from a Rs. 5,000 crore turnover to Rs.15,000 crores during this stint. The challenge was to ensure that systems, processes and people keep the pace of the growth. The business finance team was involved in all major transformation initiatives and he is proud of the benchmarks that were set on excellence by the team. He recruited fresh talent and built the business finance team and started the CA training program at Lupin. In his last role at Lupin, he was appointed as the Head of Finance, IT, and procurement for North America, and Finance for Latin America and EMEA.\n\nNext chapter unfolds – EuroKids International\n\nRajiv feels that it is important to disrupt and challenge oneself from time to time. When he got an opportunity to join EuroKids International, one of the leading education service providers in the country, he decided to take it up. Rajiv is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the KKR-backed company. Talking more about why he decided to join the company, he said, “I had never worked in the education sector, but I believe that it has a great amount of potential. My interaction with the management team and the idea of working in a sector which has such tremendous potential for influencing the development and future of our country further reinforced my decision to join the company”.\n\nRajiv is thoroughly enjoying his time at the company and is very excited about how things are shaping up in the education sector and for the company. Throwing light on how EuroKids is differentiating itself in the market, he says, “Until the pandemic, we were providing education in the school premises, however the pandemic has presented us with the opportunity to extend our business to a 3 stack model with an online, physical classroom and the hybrid version of online and in-school learning.”\n\nIndia’s growth story\n\nRajiv sincerely believes in India’s growth story and feels that the best is yet to come. Particularly after the pandemic, he trusts that the economy and industries are going to bounce back, and investments and growth will be at a much-accelerated pace. Talking more about the pandemic, he says “It has taught us that we are enormously resilient, and the power of the human spirit is undeniable”. He further adds that the pandemic has broken all notions and myths of what cannot be done.\n\n“The pandemic surely took away a lot from us, but it has also given us things that we should make a lot more out of,” he adds.\n\nConsulting versus industry\n\nRajiv believes that working in consulting and the industry has its own set of merits. Consulting provides a diversity of experience, keeps you abreast with newer technologies, and involves taking on the challenges where you are thought leaders to advise clients. He recommends that young professionals should spend some time in consulting in the initial years as it teaches one about how to think from a client perspective, structure thoughts, articulate one’s views and have a solution-oriented focus. Talking more about it, he says, while the consultant’s job is to recommend, the corporate’s job is to implement, and the final execution of recommendations is what resides with the corporates. The common thing across both the roles is – how are we adding value, which also has been Rajiv’s guiding principle. “As a professional, whether in consulting or corporate, our responsibility should be to work and deliver three aspects of value: value creation, value protection, and value enablement,” he adds.\n\nWork philosophies\n\nSome philosophies that Rajiv learnt at EY and continues to abide by are – getting the right person for the job, overinvesting in people – the people element is central to success, always getting people who are smarter than yourself, consciously rotating people and giving them opportunities to work on different assignments, giving people the freedom to operate and keeping them motivated. “If you focus on integrity, humility, and excellence within teams, you are there,” he adds.\n\nBeyond work\n\nRajiv starts his day by playing badminton and it is something that refreshes him every morning. Rajiv thoroughly enjoyed running half marathons in the past and wants to start running again. His dream is to run a triathlon, which is an endurance multisport race consisting of swimming, cycling, and running over various distances. Rajiv is an avid traveller and misses traveling during the COVID times. He wishes to explore most of the Himalayas while trekking and mountaineering. A big foodie himself, Rajiv enjoys meeting new people, embracing new cultures and relishing the food of these cultures. He shares that it is something that he got from EY because of the work travel that he did. He has a keen interest in watching movies and interestingly can watch movies across various languages like Korean and Spanish. He feels that sport and spending time with friends and people one feels happy in the company of, is very important in life. “I am sure that’s true for everybody but in life, the four things that I focus on are health, family, work, and friends” he adds.\n\nDownload the latest issue of Alumni magazine\n\nPDF (2 MB)\n\nSummary\n\nRajiv believes that the EY experience taught him to have a strong focus on excellence and delivering value to the clients.\n\nAbout this article\n\n\n\nWorkforce\n\nAlumni\n\n\n\nRelated Article\n\nThe curious banker\n\nRead Seshasayee Shankaranarayanan, Director, Barclays account on his exceptional EY experience.\n\nEY Global\n\nThe art of authenticity\n\nRead Manish Vora’s journey as an EY alumnus and Executive Director, VP and CFO Johnson and Johnson (South Asia).\n\nEY Global\n\n')]"

Yet, they often struggle to manage their capital life cycle in an efficient and agile way. The EY Capital Operations and Innovation Suite provides tools to do just that.\n\n\n\nConsulting\n\nTechnology\n\nStrategy by EY-Parthenon\n\nAI\n\nStrategy and Transactions\n\nTax\n\nThe team\n\nTo keep up with innovation and stay ahead of their competitors, TMT companies must continuously invest in capital in various areas of their business. While the precise focus of this investment varies between the different industry subsectors, an efficient and predictable capital life cycle is critical to the profitable growth of every TMT business.\n\nWhat EY can do for you\n\nCompanies often struggle to connect and align the teams, processes and tools to manage their entire capital life cycle in the most effective and agile way and capture the full value of their strategy. In a recent EY survey, 83% of business executives agree that companies need a much more agile way of managing capital. Still, several pain points prevent companies from achieving an optimal capital life cycle.\n\nFor example, a lack of connectivity and visibility between finance and operations can mean investment allocation decisions become disconnected from their related deployment, limiting efficiency and predictability in the capital life cycle while also reducing agility and responsiveness of capital investment. In the same EY survey, 82% of all companies said that they believe that there is a lack of accountability and interconnectivity across the capital life cycle that needs to be solved.\n\nAlso, it’s often difficult to track spend granularly against the original business case and KPIs, meaning deviations and value leakage cannot be quickly identified and corrected. Our research found that leading TMT companies are more than twice as likely to deploy and utilize advanced analytics based on a trusted data foundation (77% vs. 33%) to manage their capital life cycle.\n\nOnly a minority of TMT companies have a robust approach across capital spending and deployment, leading to a significant opportunity to improve efficiency and predictability to overtake the competition.\n\nAn efficient and agile capital life cycle is critical to the profitable growth of every TMT business.\n\nCapital investment pain points now have a solution\n\nBut now, there’s a way for these companies to wrest back full control and oversight of their capital investments. The EY Capital Operations and Innovation Suite (EY COInS) is a set of solutions specifically developed to help TMT companies make better decisions about their capital investments and drive operational efficiency across the capital life cycle.\n\nBringing together advanced technologies and robust governance and operational processes, EY COInS strengthens the connectivity between finance and operations. It embeds efficiency, agility, visibility and, most importantly, predictability across capital allocation and operational deployments — helping TMT companies deliver successful market growth strategies, innovation and wide-ranging ecosystems and business collaborations.\n\nCore components\n\nEY COInS helps to deliver value to TMT companies across the entire capital life cycle. At its core, the suite has two key components:\n\nCapital allocation capabilities: End-to-end capital allocation decision support solutions that assist in the development, evaluation and monitoring of capital strategies and allocation alternatives, with the ultimate goal of creating value for organizations\n\nCapital deployment capabilities: Solutions that add value to capital deployment by innovating in-field operations and asset tracking, increasing real-time visibility of spend across business units and promoting better capital management behaviors\n\nEY COInS offers a distinctive approach to the capital investment life cycle, enabled by proprietary leading-edge tools and enablers. It leverages experience from a wide breadth of EY teams capabilities, including robust capital allocation, efficient capital project deployment and asset maintenance, capitalization policy, tax incentives and other tax benefits, ESG drivers and optimal reporting considerations.\n\nUsed together in conjunction with existing ecosystems (ERP, operational systems, etc.), these innovative capabilities seamlessly connect and improve the capital life cycle from end to end — and provide TMT leaders with better capital outcomes. These are all underpinned by EY leading-edge technology and unsurpassed global experience and capabilities in areas including capital allocation, capital deployment, capitalization policy, tax, ESG drivers and reporting.\n\nThe EY Capital Operations and Innovation Suite can help you:\n\nBring transparency and predictability throughout the capital optimization life cycle and help accelerate speed to value in capital investment deployment\n\nAlign capital allocation to strategy by optimizing the capital expenditure portfolio\n\nPlan, forecast and deploy capital investments and returns accurately and efficiently\n\nBuild a culture of accountability for capital returns\n\nHelp improve return on invested capital (ROIC)\n\nContact us\n\nYour TMT business already operates at digital speed in delivering your products and services.

Your interview experience at EY may be a mix of in-person, video and phone interviews, so that we have ample opportunity to engage.\n\nWe want to attract the best talent to join EY teams so our interviews are designed to be challenging, but we also want them to be interesting and relevant to provide you with an exceptional candidate experience that helps you get to know us, too.\n\nWe hire for our future success – and for yours.\n\nLearning resources\n\nCheck out tips and other career resources from EY recruiters that may help you with your job search process.\n\nHow self-knowledge can help you become your best self (pdf)\n\nBecoming your best self (pdf)\n\nOvercoming the “burnt out” nature of the job-hunting process (pdf)\n\nBest practices applying for a role (pdf)\n\nHow to keep track of jobs you’ve applied for (pdf)\n\nAddressing gaps in your resume (pdf)\n\nUsing effective keywords (pdf)\n\nHow to explain your skillset (pdf)\n\nResume do's and don'ts (pdf)\n\nResume FAQs (pdf)\n\nHow to start your LinkedIn profile (pdf)\n\nBuilding your brand and networking – best practices (pdf)\n\nConnecting with recruiters and hiring managers (pdf)\n\nHow to write an effective networking email for LinkedIn (pdf)\n\nNetworking tips (pdf)\n\nHow to conduct in-depth research into a role (pdf)\n\nHow to answer “tell me about yourself” (pdf)\n\nVideo interview tips (pdf)\n\nRelax. We want the real you.\n\nIt’s not always easy, but try to relax and be natural. The main purpose of the interview is for us to learn more about you, so be prepared to talk about yourself and your relevant skills and experience. We want to understand your personality and mindset as well as your skillset, so bear that in mind when answering questions and be authentic.\n\nBe confident, but not arrogant. Be enthusiastic and positive, but focused – tell your stories succinctly, don’t ramble.\n\nPut yourselves in our shoes – what do you think we’re looking for in a candidate?\n\nListening is just as important as the answers you give\n\nPay keen attention to the question being asked of you and ensure you fully answer it without getting side-tracked. While you’ll be eager to tell us about examples of previous projects and experiences that showcase your knowledge, skills and ambition, it’s important that you select those that are appropriate to what the interviewer wants to hear. This is an opportunity for you to analyze the question being asked and then help deliver a unique response.\n\nExcite us\n\nWhy is it a good idea for us to hire you? What makes you a great asset to EY teams? Highlight what makes you stand out and why we should be excited about having you join us.\n\nTalk about what you’re good at, the things you’ve done and what they demonstrate to us about your strengths and abilities. When something went well, why, and what did you contribute to make the outcome a success? When it didn’t go so well, how did you handle that and what happened? Give compelling, concrete examples, with facts and figures to back it up. It all helps us to really understand what you’re capable of.\n\nYou can never do too much research\n\nIf you are well researched, your knowledge will not only show off your preparation but also enable you to communicate with us on a deeper level.\n\nIn addition to your research on EY, make sure that you research who you will be meeting during your interview. Take a look at their LinkedIn profile and read up on any articles they’ve written and their past experience. This will give you the opportunity to make a connection with your interviewer and discuss topics that are most relevant.\n\nEnsure that you fully understand the role on offer and the way in which you will fit into the organization and its structure. This will give you a holistic view of EY, making it easier to communicate what attributes you have that suit the role’s needs. If you are applying to a new industry having worked in a different type of role previously, you’ll need to think of your transferable skills and how this relates to the position you are interviewing for. Also think about where the job might go in the future and what thoughts or questions you might have around that.\n\nWe’re also interested in hearing your point of view on current key market trends, so it’s a good idea to be well-informed before your interview.\n\nThink about what we’re looking for\n\nWe look for people with the qualities we most value. That means people who actively seek new experiences, who want to define their own success and career journey. People who value diversity and inclusiveness. People who demonstrate integrity, respect, and collaboration. Who have energy, enthusiasm, and the courage to lead with purpose.\n\nIn fact, purpose is the focus of our Transformative Leadership model at EY, which is how we develop leaders who are driven by purpose and bring out the best in themselves and others.\n\nBringing out the best in yourself begins with continuous investment in your personal development so that you can then bring out the best in others by actively mentoring and coaching them. It means building trust, relating to others with integrity, authenticity and courage. And overall, it means being passionate about your team, business and impact on your community.\n\nThink about relevant examples from your own experience that demonstrate these qualities, to share with us at the interview.\n\nWe also believe that your mindset is as important as your skillset. We look for people with global, innovative and analytics mindsets, so be prepared to show us how your mindset fits ours.\n\nVideo and phone interviewing\n\nSome interviews will be virtual or on the phone, but the same principles apply. Preparation is crucial. As well as preparing what you want to say, make sure that you’re in a comfortable, quiet environment for the interview. Find out how long it’s likely to last and tell people not to interrupt you.\n\nFor a phone interview, use a landline if you have access to one for better reception. If you use a mobile, remember to turn off call waiting. Although you can’t be seen, dressing smartly may help you feel more confident, while standing up to talk can help you to feel more energized and focused.\n\nIf we can’t see your face, how you sound becomes more important in showing your personality. Be upbeat and enthusiastic and try to smile – it really does show in your voice. It’s fine to take some thinking time before answering questions, but let us know so that we’re not worried by the silence.\n\nIt’s a two-way process\n\nBuild a rapport with your interviewers by showing an interest in their roles or divisions. Ask questions about their work, experiences at EY, and the team you’ll be joining. It may help you to think about what you want to ask us and write down those questions before your interview.\n\nWe’re proud of our values and the benefits offered to EY people, and we are happy to give you as much information as you need to be able to decide if we’re really the right place for you, so don’t be afraid to ask us questions too.\n\nExperienced professionals\n\nBuild a career as unique as you are. We’ll provide the global scale, personal support, inclusive culture and technology you need to become the best version of you.\n\nFind jobs\n\nStudents and entry-level\n\nFrom student programs and other offerings to full-time positions, find a role where you can build an exceptional experience for yourself and a better working world for all.\n\nFind jobs\n\n"")]"
