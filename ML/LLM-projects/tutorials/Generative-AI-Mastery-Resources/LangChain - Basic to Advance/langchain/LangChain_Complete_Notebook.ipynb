PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",

One of the very deleterious departures is\\nﬂooding due to the over rain.[2] According to Wikipedia in late summer 2002,\\nenormous storm downpours driven to gigantic ﬂooding in eastern India, Nepal,\\nand Bangladesh, killing over 500 individuals and clearing out millions of houses.\\nEach year in Bangladesh approximately 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 sq mi)\\n(around 18% of the country) is ﬂooded, killing over 5,000 individuals and wreck-\\ning more than 7 million homes. On the other hand, Western Sydney is now\\nthe ”greatest concern” from the worst ﬂoods in decades to have ravaged east-\\nern Australia.[3] Jonh C, Rodda et al. presented a very rational method of the\\nrainfall measurement problem. The application of science and innovation that\\npredicts the state of the environment at any given speciﬁc period is known as\\nclimate determining or weather forecasting. There are many distinctive strate-\\ngies for climate estimate and weather forecasting. But rainfall prediction is rare.\\nSome of the research has shown some classiﬁcation method to predict whether\\nit would be rain tomorrow or not. But instead of a classiﬁcation method for pre-\\ndicting rain, we need to the quantity of the rainfall in a particular place. There\\nis numerous equipment implement for foreseeing rainfall by utilizing the climate\\nconditions like temperature, humidity, weight. These conventional strategies can-\\nnot work productively so by utilizing machine learning procedures. we can create\\nan exact comes about rain forecast. Ready to fair do it by having the histori-\\ncal information investigation of rainfall and can anticipate the precipitation for\\nfuture seasons. In our paper, we presented some predictive regression analysis\\ntechniques to quantify rainfall quantity at a place. Here we used more than 10\\nyears of historical data to train our model. The dataset contains various weather\\nconditions of diﬀerent places. This method can be utilized to predict the rainfall\\n(The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm) and avoid the annihilation\\ncaused by it to life, agriculture, farm, and property. If we can quantify the rain-\\nfall most people can make some decisions before overwhelmed rain-aﬀected.

For\\nthis reason, we took some steps to handle these issues. such as,\\n–Erased duplicate row and column: we discover that numerous information\\npoints are repeated in row and column sections. Therefore, we expelled all\\nthe duplicate information.\\n–Erased the row and column, which shows up more than 50% of the null value.\\nCleaning data occurs when 50% of information comes to the null value.

The missing value may be a common occasion in\\ninformation. On the other hand, most prescient modeling strategies can’t\\nhandle any missing value. Thus, this issue must be unraveled before model-\\ning. In some cases, median, mean, mode strategies are utilized to overhaul\\na missing value.

In our dataset, there exist a few categorical\\nfeatures. We have utilized one-hot encoding, one of the foremost prevalent\\nencoding algorithms, to encode the categorical values into numbers. It is the\\nforemost common approach, and it works well unless any categorical variable\\ntakes a large number of diverse values. After this encoding, a double matrix\\nis shaped where 1 indicates the presence of any value and 0 indicates the\\nabsence of the value.\\n–Inside our dataset, there were a lot of outliers presented: an outlier is a\\nperception point that’s removed from other perceptions.

All things considered,\\nthere are diﬀerent strategies like Min-Max Scaling, Variance Scaling, Stan-\\ndardization, Mean Normalization, and Unit vectors for include scaling. In\\nour work, we have applied standard scaling as a feature scaling procedure.\\nHere, the exchanged every data point in the range of between -1 and 1.\\n3.3 Training selective Models\\nThe linear model[24]performs well in machine learning linearly. We utilized the\\nfour regressors as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Polynomial Regression,\\nand Lasso Regression. Tree-model [25]algorithms are considered to be one of the\\nleading and most utilized supervised learning methods. In this work, we utilize\\na decision tree regressor. We utilized ”gini” for the Gini impurity, and the split-\\nter is chosen as ’best’ to select the part at each node. Ensemble methods[26]\\nare procedures that make multiple models and combine them to create moves\\nforward. Here, we utilized four ensemble-based regressors. These are Random\\nForest, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost, and XGboost. Afterward, we have utilized\\nthree neighbors regressors of statistical pattern recognition. This is K- nearest\\nneighbors[27],ﬁve nearest is chosen for every iteration. Besides, the Manhat-\\ntan distance is chosen for all neighbor classiﬁers. The support vector machine\\nSVM[28] is used mainly for exploring a hyperplane in ddimensional space that\\nnotably ﬁts a hyperplane in data points. In the linear SVM, we used hinge as\\nloss function with l2 penalty.\\n4 Experiment\\nIn the advancement of our test from the proposed work, we have to begin with\\namassed the demonstrate and prepared it. 10 diﬀerent regressors from super-\\nvised learning based on distinctive learning techniques have been executed to'),\n",
