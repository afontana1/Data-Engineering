<p><strong>Rivian Automotive Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RIVN#NASDAQ">RIVN</a>) CEO <strong>RJ Scaringe</strong> said <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31505676/rivian-relocating-staff-to-illinois-ev-plant-to-boost-production-report">his company</a> would rather be in charge of its own software experience than rely on third-party services like <strong>CarPlay</strong> offered by <strong>Apple Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ">AAPL</a>). </p><br><br><br><br><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Vertically integrating Rivian&#8217;s electronic stack and software stack allowed the EV maker to integrate features in a way that you typically don&#8217;t see, Scaringe said in an interview. Scaringe was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdjDDtHvUXA">speaking</a> with YouTuber <strong>Marques Brownlee</strong> on the <strong>Waveform podcast</strong>. </p><br><br><br><br><p>&#8220;You have to control the entirety of the software stack to really fully leverage right all the capabilities,&#8221; Scaringe said. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Controlling the system allows the company to be the &#8220;arbiter or the head chef&#8221; of the customer experience, allowing it to quickly iterate and improve, as opposed to handing it over to a third party, Scaringe said. </p><br><br><br><br><p>During the interview, the CEO of Rivian mentioned the possibility of adding CarPlay to their vehicles in the future, but only if there was significant consumer demand for it.  </p><br><br><br><br><p><em><strong>See Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-electric-vehicle-stocks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Electric Vehicle Stocks</a></em></p><br><br><br><br><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>While <strong>Lucid Group Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/LCID#NASDAQ">LCID</a>) <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31487268/lucid-air-turns-up-apple-compatibility-with-wireless-carplay">announced</a> in late March that the CarPlay software will be standard on all Lucid Air EVs, <strong>General Motors</strong> <strong>Co</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GM#NYSE">GM</a>) <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31610418/gm-taps-google-to-phase-out-apple-carplay-from-evs-starting-with-2024-chevrolet-blazer">said</a> that it plans to phase out CarPlay and Android Auto technologies starting with the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Instead, GM now proposes to shift to built-in infotainment systems with <strong>Alphabet Inc</strong>&#8216;s (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ">GOOG</a>) (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ">GOOGL</a>) <strong>Google</strong>. </p><br><br><br><br><p>Meanwhile, Apple claimed in June that about 79% of car buyers in the U.S. will not consider a model without CarPlay. </p><br><br><br><br><p><em>Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>following this link</em></a><em>.</em></p><br><br><br><br><p><em><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31737789/warren-buffett-backed-byds-new-supercar-grooves-on-all-4-wheels-to-show-off-control-system"><em>Warren Buffett-Backed BYD&#8217;s New Supercar Grooves On All 4 Wheels To Show Off Control System</em></a></p><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
