<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM)</strong> is trading relatively flat today following an upgrade at Susquehanna to "Positive" from "Neutral." After numerous red days over the past few weeks, shares of TSM flirted with previous support around the $86 mark. Although today's move is minor, it could signal a higher low. </p><p> <strong>Briefing.com notes</strong> that today's positive analyst rating comes amid several unpleasant developments from TSM and the semiconductor space. Last week, TSM issued disappointing Q1 guidance, noting revenue fell by 15.4% yr/yr, below consensus. The next day, Warren Buffett <strong>(BRK.B)</strong> disclosed that he sold nearly all of his TSM stake earlier this year, citing geopolitical tensions. Today, reports indicate that TSM may lower its FY23 capital expenditures to $28-32 bln, significantly below its initial forecast of $32-36 bln. </p><ul><li>After TSM's underwhelming Q1 forecast, we cautioned that tech firms utilizing TSM to manufacture its chips, which include market movers like <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> and <strong>Qualcomm (QCOM)</strong>, may run into some troubles ahead of earnings season. TSM's Smartphone revenue already reversed its positive momentum in Q4 after experiencing sequential growth in the previous two quarters. <ul><li> Rival <strong>Samsung's (SSNLF)</strong> weak guidance last week increases the likeliness of turbulence within the semiconductor industry, at least for the first part of FY23. </li></ul></li><li>Coinciding with softening demand dynamics are geopolitical concerns. TSM's two most prominent regions in terms of revenue and physical presence are China and the U.S. There are numerous reports regarding China/Taiwan relations and how tensions may be heating up. This uncertainty can bring higher volatility surrounding shares of TSM, especially on any nerve-racking headlines. </li><li> TSM's CapEx is spent in anticipation of future growth. However, growth has been decelerating over the past few quarters, illustrated by CapEx in FY22 coming in at just over $36 bln, well below its forecast six months prior of approximately $40 bln. The additional cut signals further weakness and makes management's comments last quarter that demand may have started stabilizing less concrete. <ul><li> The news also adversely impacts semiconductor equipment firms like <strong>Lam Research (LRCX)</strong>, <strong>ASML (ASML)</strong>, and <strong>KLA Corp (KLAC)</strong>, all of which are down meaningfully today. </li></ul></li></ul><p> Although recent developments signal a tough road ahead, conditions may not be as gloomy as they appear. TSM, as well as many of its peers like <strong>Micron (MU)</strong>, have discussed the possibility of a recovery toward the second half of the year, meaning that a bottom could occur within the next couple of quarters. Meanwhile, although geopolitical risks are real, TSM has been bolstering its U.S. presence, building a second chip plant in Arizona. Also, there would be no benefit to destroying TSM's factories if a worst-case scenario occurred, limiting some financial risk to TSM. </p><p> Bottom line, near-term macroeconomic conditions could bring turbulence for TSM. However, the move toward a fabless business model across the tech industry keeps TSM's long-term positioning resilient. Finally, TSM reports Q1 earnings on April 20.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
