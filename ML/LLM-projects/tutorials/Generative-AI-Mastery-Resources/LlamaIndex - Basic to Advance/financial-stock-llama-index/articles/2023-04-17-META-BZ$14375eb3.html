First, programs and systems that pose an unacceptable danger, such as Chinese government-run social scoring, are prohibited. Second, high-risk apps, such as a CV-scanning tool that evaluates job candidates, must follow strict regulatory guidelines. Finally, the majority of applications are left unregulated if they are not expressly prohibited or labeled as high-risk.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>According to <strong>Axel Voss</strong>, a German MEP from the European People&#39;s Party and one of the principal drafters of the EU&#39;s Artificial Intelligence Act has recently urged AI companies &ndash; such as <strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>), <strong>Alphabet, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ">GOOGL</a>), and&nbsp;<strong>Meta Platforms, Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ">META</a>)&nbsp;&ndash; to be more transparent. Adding that the European Union must prepare its citizens to distinguish between real and false information.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Dragos Tudorache</strong>, a Romanian MEP from Renew Europe, also recently stated that when AI is used for misinformation, the EU must supervise and regulate the technology.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Italy&#39;s Ban On ChatGPT</strong></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>In March, the Italian data protection regulator, the &quot;Garante della Privacy,&quot; put a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/government/23/03/31609921/mimicking-human-language-and-writing-chatgpt-is-hailed-as-next-great-gold-rush-but-italy-just-banned" target="_blank">temporary ban</a> on Open AI&#39;s,&nbsp;ChatGPT,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>AI chatbot&nbsp;backed by Microsoft, due to violations of data protection regulations.&nbsp;The Italian government agency said that the ban would be lifted <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31784039/chatgpt-could-return-in-italy-but-only-if-openai-meets-some-demands" target="_blank">if OpenAI met these standards by April 30</a>.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Italy is&nbsp;the first Western country to take action against the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, but other European governments have expressed similar worries, although no bans have been issued so far.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The Spanish authority stated that it had received no complaints about ChatGPT, but could not rule out further inquiry.<br />&#13;<br>Privacy regulators in France and Ireland have contacted their Italian counterparts to learn more about the reasons for the ban on ChatGPT.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Now Read:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31828459/google-reportedly-goes-into-panic-as-samsung-considers-microsofts-bing-ai-for-default-search-engine">Google Reportedly Goes Into &#39;Panic&#39; As Samsung Considers Microsoft&#39;s Bing AI For Default Search Engine&nbsp;</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
