<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM +5%) </strong>is appreciating nicely today after delivering a solid beat-and-raise in Q3. The semiconductor manufacturer's favorable results follow numerous warnings from competitors and customers over the past couple of months as the semiconductor industry endures considerable demand softness.</p><p> However, that is not to say TSM is not also experiencing weakening demand. TSM stated that it is observing softness in consumer end markets, spurring its customers to adjust their inventory levels, affecting TSM's 1H23 utilization rate. TSM anticipates a few quarters in FY23 to pass until inventory is rebalanced to healthier levels. Also, while data center and automotive markets are holding up decently, TSM sees the possibility of adjustment down the road. These bearish remarks show up somewhat in TSM's Q4 guidance. The company expects revs of $19.9-20.7 bln, representing just 28.9% growth yr/yr at the midpoint, far below the +35.9% jump registered in Q3, +36.6% in Q2, and +36.0 in Q1. </p><p>Nonetheless, TSM's positive comments on long-term demand and ability to outperform the industry during the next few quarters greatly overpowered its less enthusiastic remarks. </p><ul><li> TSM is projecting positive growth for FY23 while maintaining its long-term revenue growth target of +15-20% annualized (in U.S. dollar terms). </li><li> This is partly due to TSM's ability to operate with less volatility than the overall semiconductor industry. Remember that TSM produces over half of the world's semiconductors and nearly all of the more advanced chips. This commanding presence allows TSM to continue winning new business while enabling its customers to win business. It also creates solid end-market diversification. </li><li>It is also worth noting that high-performance computing (HPC) demand remains strong, and TSM is ahead of INTC in technological advancement to capture and maintain market share in this field. </li></ul><p> Still, shares of TSM are down close to 50% on the year, a close resemblance to the overall semiconductor sector, underscoring the difficult environment currently plaguing the company. With smartphone and PC demand falling off a cliff recently, illustrated by <strong>Advanced Micro's (AMD)</strong> over $1 bln cut to its Q3 sales forecast, FY23 will prove quite the hurdle for TSM. The company already tightened FY22 CapEx to around $36 bln from last quarter's expectation of $40-44 bln due partly to capacity optimizations based on the current bearish outlook. It expects further tightening moving forward as well. </p><p>Nevertheless, although TSM is not overly optimistic about the state of its industry over the near term, its reaffirmed long-term guidance highlights that despite industry corrections, it can continue to grow at a high level.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
