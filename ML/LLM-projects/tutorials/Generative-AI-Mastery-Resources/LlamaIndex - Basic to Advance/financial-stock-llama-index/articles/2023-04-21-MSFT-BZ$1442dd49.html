<p>The New York Fed recession probability model suggests there is a <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/capital_markets/Prob_Rec.pdf">57.7% chance</a> of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months, the highest recession probability since 1982. However, you wouldn&#39;t know it by looking at the stock market. In fact, the <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE">SPY</a>) is actually up 8% year-to-date as the economy has cooled, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.benzinga.com/topic/recession">recession risk has risen.</a></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Recession Red Flags: </strong>On Friday, LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Krosby addressed the strange divergence between the stock market and the economy and said next week could be a major turning point for investors.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Related Link: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/04/31839031/10-reasons-the-s-p-500-could-be-headed-higher-in-2023">10 Reasons The S&amp;P 500 Could Be Headed Higher In 2023</a> </em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Krosby said there&#39;s a growing list of red flags for the U.S. economy. The Conference Board&#39;s Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) suggest a recession is imminent, the labor market is finally starting to soften, the Fed&#39;s latest Beige Book indicated &quot;several districts&quot; are experiencing stressed lending conditions, and crude oil prices are struggling to gain momentum despite OPEC&nbsp;production cuts. To make matters worse, the U.S. debt ceiling deadline is looming, creating even more economic uncertainty.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>What&#39;s Going On?</strong> Krosby said the stock market&#39;s resiliency amid the growing list of bearish indicators reflects investors looking beyond current economic conditions and pricing in both Fed rate cuts and a resolution to the debt ceiling drama.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Related Link: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/14/11/4980296/nobel-prize-winners-perfect-portfolio-the-secret-ingredient-revealed-1">Here&#39;s The Secret Ingredient To Becoming A Successful Investor, According To Two Nobel Prize Winners</a> </em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>In past quarters, Krosby said investors were willing to forgive companies with weak earnings as long as they included cost-cutting measures along with their guidance. However, the big sell-off in <strong>Tesla Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ">TSLA</a>) on Thursday suggests investors may not be so forgiving of earnings misses from big tech stocks <strong>Microsoft Corp</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>), <strong>Alphabet, Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ">GOOG</a>) (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ">GOOGL</a>) and <strong>Meta Platforms, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ">META</a>), all of which report next week.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;Price action has unequivocally won the ongoing tug-of-war, but where lower Treasury yields are reflecting recession fears,&quot; Krosby said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;Next week could be the beginning of the final round of the push-pull skirmish between the market and economic trends.&quot;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Benzinga&#39;s Take:</strong>&nbsp;The stock market tends to be forward-thinking, but it may not be so anticipatory that investors can simply ignore and power through&nbsp;an entire U.S. recession without experiencing a considerable decline in the S&amp;P 500. Much of 2023&#39;s stock market strength may be stemming from the fact that investors already priced in a severe U.S. recession when the Federal Reserve began aggressively raising interest rates in 2022.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Now Read:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/04/31942124/bitcoin-ethereum-and-dogecoin-drop-following-hawish-inflation-data-what-to-watch-over-the-">Bitcoin, Ethereum And Dogecoin Drop Following Hawish Inflation Data: What To Watch Over The Weekend&nbsp;</a></em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
