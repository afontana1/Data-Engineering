<p>Shares of Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>) moved higher by 17.91% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Microsoft has. </p><br><h2>Microsoft Debt</h2><br><p>Based on Microsoft's financial statement as of January 24, 2023, long-term debt is at $44.12 billion and current debt is at $4.00 billion, amounting to $48.12 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $15.65 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $32.47 billion.</p><br><p>Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. </p><br><p>To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Microsoft's $364.55 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.13. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.</p><br><p><img src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1682104705_0.png" alt="debt_fig" /></p><br><br><h2>Why Investors Look At Debt?</h2><br><p>Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.</p><br><p>However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.</p><br><p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?
