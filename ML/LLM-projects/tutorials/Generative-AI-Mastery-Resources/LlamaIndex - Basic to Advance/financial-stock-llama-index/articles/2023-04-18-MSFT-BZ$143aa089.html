<p>Among the many perks <strong>Amazon</strong>&#39;s (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ">AMZN</a>) Prime offers, there&#39;s one benefit that often gets overlooked, especially by dedicated gamers: Prime Gaming.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Despite being around since 2016 under the name Twitch Prime, many Amazon Prime members remain unaware of Prime Gaming.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>But, what exactly is Prime Gaming? Simply put, it&#39;s Amazon&#39;s gaming hub that offers exclusive in-game items and free access to rotating games for Prime members.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31673991/amazon-lets-go-100-gaming-division-employees-updates-on-recent-efforts-in-unit">Amazon Lets Go 100 Gaming Division Employees, Updates On Recent Efforts In Unit</a></em><br />&#13;<br>The service, currently available in over 200 countries, including the U.S., U.K., and Canada, was <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/government/20/08/17042198/as-twitch-rebrands-to-prime-gaming-amazon-faces-questions-on-platforms-music-rights">rebranded as Prime Gaming in 2020 </a>as part of a service refresh aimed at improving the platform&#39;s functionality and accessibility.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>To access Prime Gaming, users simply need an Amazon Prime membership and a compatible device, such as a PC or gaming console. While the benefits of Prime Gaming may be relatively unknown, they&#39;re certainly worth exploring.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Gamers can access a wide range of free games, from indie titles to classic favorites, as well as receive in-game rewards for popular games such as <strong>Epic Games</strong>&#39;&nbsp;&quot;Fortnite&quot; and<strong> EA</strong>&#39;s (NASDQ: EA) &quot;Apex Legends.&quot;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Prime Gaming also offers a selection of free PC games every month, along with discounts on other game titles.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><h3>Rewards: What&#39;s Available And How To Get Them</h3>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The rewards offered on Prime Gaming, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/prime-gaming-everything-you-need-to-know-about-this-amazon-prime-perk">per</a> Tom&#39;s Guide, can be&nbsp;classified into two categories: in-game content and free games.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Prime Gaming&#39;s in-game content includes exclusive items for popular games like &quot;Madden NFL 23,&quot;&nbsp;<strong>Tencent</strong>&#39;s (OTC:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TCEHY#OTC">TCEHY</a>) &quot;League of Legends,&quot; and &quot;Fall Guys.&quot; It also regularly rotates. Whether you play on a PC, <strong>Sony</strong>&#39;s (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SONY#NYSE">SONY</a>) PlayStation, or <strong>Microsoft</strong>&#39;s (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>)&nbsp;Xbox, there&#39;s a good chance that Prime Gaming has something to offer for your favorite game.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>However, the true gem of Prime Gaming are the free games available through the &quot;weekly games&quot; tab. These games are completely free to claim and rotate on a regular basis. While the selection often features smaller indie titles, Prime Gaming also offers blockbuster games occasionally.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The downside? These free games on Prime Gaming are limited to PC. Console gamers using PS5 or Xbox Series X will have to turn to other services such as PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass for their free gaming needs.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>To claim these rewards, Amazon Prime members can easily visit the Prime Gaming hub and click on the reward they wish to claim.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><h3>Is It User-Unfriendly?</h3>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The service has drawn criticism from gamers who say it falls short in terms of user experience and discoverability.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>PC Gaming senior editor <strong>Robin Valentine</strong> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amazon-prime-gaming-is-such-a-weird-mess-that-it-makes-getting-free-games-stressful/">wrote</a>: &quot;The page is an absolute tangle to even navigate, and once you do find the games you want to grab, you discover they all unlock on different services.&quot;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Valentine also criticized the service for lacking any sense of order or consistency.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;The human brain craves order; Amazon, what you have created here is chaos,&quot; he added.&nbsp;The reporter noted that the service offers a wide range of games each month, from modern AAA titles to obscure 90s arcade games and classic CRPGs. However, he argued that this haphazard approach makes it difficult for users to navigate and find games that interest them.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;The biggest issue, as with most of Amazon&#39;s perks, is discoverability,&quot; he added. &quot;For a company that has my email address more times over than anyone but Google, it&#39;s weirdly bad at actually letting me know when a game I might like is available.&quot;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Next:<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/23/04/31817050/45-of-gamers-spend-more-time-playing-than-ever-before-why-that-could-be-a-good-thing">&nbsp;45% Of Gamers Spend More Time Playing Than Ever Before - Why That Could Be A Good Thing</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Image credits: Yan Krukau on Pexels and logo on Wikipedia</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
