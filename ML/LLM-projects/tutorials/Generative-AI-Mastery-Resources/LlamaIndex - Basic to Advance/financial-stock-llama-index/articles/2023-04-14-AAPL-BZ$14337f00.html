<p>Legendary investor <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> is a fan of railroads, especially one of the leading railroad companies in North America, which is owned by<strong> Berkshire Hathaway Inc </strong>(NYSE: <a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/brk-a#NYSE">BRK-A</a>)(NYSE: <a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/brk-b#NYSE">BRK-B</a>).</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Buffett received some criticism and concerns about overpayment for the railway,&nbsp;but the legendary investor can likely laugh about it today.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Since 1970, Berkshire Hathaway has acquired more than 50 companies and increased the size of its portfolio. Companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway include<strong> GEICO, Helzberg Diamonds, Fruit of the Loom, Duracell </strong><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/03/26224759/warren-buffett-owns-what-10-berkshire-acquisitions-you-may-have-forgotten">and <strong>Dairy Queen.</strong></a></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Berkshire Hathaway is also the owner of <strong>BNSF Railway,</strong> one of the largest freight railroad networks in North America.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Buffett began investing in BNSF Railway in 2007 and years later <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/34478">offered to acquire</a> the remaining stake in the company Berkshire did not already own.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Berkshire Hathaway announced in 2009 that it would acquire the remaining 77.4% of BNSF for $100 per share. The deal valued the company at $44 billion, including $10 billion in outstanding debt and marked one of the largest acquisitions in Berkshire Hathaway&#39;s history.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The deal was also pretty noteworthy as it was done with cash and Berkshire stock, something that broke tradition for the typical all-cash deal Buffett.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Alongside the deal for BNSF, Buffett also announced the introduction of the Class B Berkshire shares, at a 50-for-1 ratio.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>A recent chart shared in the daily <strong>Whitney Tilson</strong> email from watchlistinvesting <a href="https://twitter.com/brk_student/status/1645470367786336269?s=43&amp;t=1NJqPxlS98BApRn508dnaw">highlighted&nbsp;</a>just how good the BNSF deal has been for Berkshire Hathaway.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;Speaking of Buffett, many critics said he overpaid for BNSF Railway when he acquired it in February 2010, shortly after the global financial crisis, in a $44 billion deal,&rdquo; Tilson writes. &ldquo;As always, he has had the last laugh, as the railroad has paid Berkshire more than $50 billion and counting.&rdquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a look at the dividends paid by BNSF to Berkshire since 2010:</strong></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2010: $1.25 billion (cumulative $1.25 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2011: $3.50 billion ($4.75 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2012: $3.75 billion ($8.50 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2013: $4.00 billion ($12.50 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2014: $3.50 billion ($16.00 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2015: $4.00 billion ($20.00 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2016: $2.50 billion ($22.50 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2017: $4.575 billion ($27.075 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2018: $5.45 billion ($32.525 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2019: $4.425 billion ($36.95 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2020: $4.83 billion ($41.78 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2021: $3.80 billion ($45.58 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>2022: $5.00 billion ($50.58 billion)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;The railroad pays us, however, only what remains after it fulfills the needs of its business and maintains a cash balance of about $2 billion,&rdquo; Buffett said previously.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Related Link: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/04/31768845/warren-buffett-explains-why-apple-stock-is-an-extraordinary-investment">Warren Buffett Explains Why Apple Stock Is An Extraordinary Investment&nbsp;</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Why It&rsquo;s Important: </strong>BNSF remains one of the most important pieces of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.
