<p>Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ">AAPL</a>) increased by 20.58% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Apple has. </p><br><h2>Apple Debt</h2><br><p>Based on Apple's financial statement as of February 3, 2023, long-term debt is at $99.63 billion and current debt is at $11.48 billion, amounting to $111.11 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $20.54 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $90.58 billion.</p><br><p>Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. <strong>Current debt</strong> is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while <strong>long-term debt</strong> is the portion due in more than 1 year. <strong>Cash equivalents</strong> includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. <strong>Total debt</strong> equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. </p><br><p>To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Apple's $346.75 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.32. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.</p><br><p><img src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1681824624_0.png" alt="debt_fig" /></p><br><br><h2>Importance of Debt</h2><br><p>Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.</p><br><p>Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.</p><br><p>Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?
