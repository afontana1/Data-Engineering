<p><strong>BofA</strong>&nbsp;analyst Wamsi Mohan maintains a Neutral rating on&nbsp;<strong>Apple Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ">AAPL</a>) with a&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings" style="color:#4a6ee0; background:transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt" target="_blank">price target of 168.00</a>.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Alphabet Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ">GOOG</a>) (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ">GOOGL</a>)&nbsp;<strong>Google&nbsp;</strong>has been the dominant search option (especially across mobile). A recent media report noted that&nbsp;<strong>Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd</strong>&nbsp;(OTC:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SSNLF#OTC">SSNLF</a>) is considering changing the&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31823704/is-bing-the-new-google-samsung-devices-could-ditch-google-search-for-microsoft-bing" style="color:#4a6ee0; background:transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt" target="_blank">default search from</a>&nbsp;Google to&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Corp</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>) Bing.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The switch from Google to Microsoft is relevant to Apple as Mohan estimates that Google pays Apple ~$20 billion for being the default search engine across iOS devices, the analyst mentions in a Tuesday note titled &quot;<strong>Can Apple be the beneficiary of the AI search wars</strong>?&quot;&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Apple has a revenue share agreement with Google, paying Apple a percentage of mobile traffic acquisition costs (TACs). Apple could re-negotiate with Google for better terms or consider switching to Microsoft when the agreement expires.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Renegotiation would involve getting a higher amount per search. Mohan estimates that Apple already gets around 80% of TAC to distribution partners.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The rise of Microsoft as a potential alternative to Google gives Apple more bargaining power to monetize an attractive installed base of over 2 billion Apple devices.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Interestingly, Apple has had a longstanding relationship with Google that has delivered an attractive low-risk revenue and profit stream for Apple. Switching to Microsoft with revenue share economics is not without risk.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>If users continue to choose Google over Microsoft (changing the default search option to Google from Microsoft), the volume of searches for which Apple gets paid will decline. A higher rate per search might not offset the share loss in aggregate search.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Further, if Google can monetize the search at a much higher level, it could be challenging for Microsoft to compete for the contract (margin loss near term vs. a view of a strategic long term)</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) actively investigates Google&#39;s potential monopoly on mobile search. Ironically, the rise of Microsoft as a credible alternative and the fact that Samsung might switch from Google to Microsoft creates a marginally more challenging case to establish Google&#39;s monopoly on mobile search.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>If the DOJ were to drop this investigation, the analyst would view it as net favorable for Apple as it removes a tail risk of high margin payments getting compromised.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Price Action:</strong>&nbsp;AAPL shares traded higher by 0.87% at $166.67 on the last check Tuesday.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo by Firmbee via Pixabay</em></p>&#13;<br> <p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
