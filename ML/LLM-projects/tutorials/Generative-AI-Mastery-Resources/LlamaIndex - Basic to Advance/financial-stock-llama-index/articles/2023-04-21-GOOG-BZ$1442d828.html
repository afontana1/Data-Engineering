Experts believe that the first quarter could show cost improvements for Alphabet.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The major challenge for the company is AI integration into search, both in terms of&nbsp;time and impact, and&nbsp;therefore a post-results discussion on future plans and outlook may constitute the most important stock driver. Alphabet, according to BofA, will be a more defensive, self-help stock in the Internet group in 2023, with higher relative earnings stability due to expenditure flexibility, great margins, and the possibility to support shares through buybacks.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Alphabet&#39;s Stock Performance And Valuations</strong></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><ul>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Alphabet&#39;s stock price is trading at $105 per share, up 20% year-to-date as of this writing.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Shares are nearly 30% lower than their all-time highs of $151 set in February 2022.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>In Q1 2023, shares rose 17.5% posting&nbsp;their strongest quarterly performance since Q2 2021.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.45, according to <a href="https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Benzinga pro data</a>.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Now Read:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31923463/big-bucks-at-google-a-look-at-how-much-alphabet-analysts-managers-and-engineers-get-paid">Making Big Bucks At Google: A Look At How Much Alphabet Analysts, Managers And Engineers Get Paid</a></em></p>&#13;<br> <p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
