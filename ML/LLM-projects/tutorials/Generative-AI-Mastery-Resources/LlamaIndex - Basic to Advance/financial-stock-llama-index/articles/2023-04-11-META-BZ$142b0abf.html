At the time of the creation, Meta Platforms traded as Facebook and Alphabet traded as Google. The original acronym also included <strong>Netflix Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ">NFLX</a>), which has since fallen out of favor as part of the basket.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Cramer was prompted to change the acronym to MAMAA in late 2022 to represent the new names and to replace Netflix with Microsoft.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;Jim Cramer initially coined the term &lsquo;FANG&rsquo; in 2013 to highlight four companies that he believed to be dominant players in their respective fields of technology,&rdquo; Roundhill CEO <strong>Will Hershey </strong>told Benzinga. &ldquo;In the years since, the term has evolved as it has become clear that there are five technology companies that stand above all else in terms of their revenues, pofits, breadth of product offerings, and more broadly, impact on the world as we know it &ndash; Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.&rdquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Hershey told Benzinga that new ETF regulations allow Roundhill to offer funds with as few as five companies that offer the same tax and cost efficiencies as other ETFs.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;We believe that the FAAMG companies remain as relevant a group as ever and believe that there is significant market demand for a vehicle like BIGT.&rdquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Related Link:<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/06/21773634/new-metaverse-etf-launches-from-roundhill-investments-what-investors-should-know"> New Metaverse ETF Launches From Roundhill Investments, What Investors Should Know&nbsp;</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Why It&rsquo;s Important:</strong> The new ETF holds only five stocks, giving investors a way to capitalize on the high-growth names without going outside the technology sector or to smaller technology names.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;Until today, the only way to gain exposure to these tech giants was by purchasing all five stocks individually, or via diversified tech ETFs that include smaller and potentially less relevant stocks,&rdquo; Mazza said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The ETF offers a &ldquo;targeted approach&rdquo; and comes with an expense ratio of 0.29%.
