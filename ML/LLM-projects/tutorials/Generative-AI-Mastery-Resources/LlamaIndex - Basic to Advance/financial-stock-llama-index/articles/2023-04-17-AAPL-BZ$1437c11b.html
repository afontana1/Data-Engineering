<p><strong>Apple, Inc.&rsquo;</strong>s (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ">AAPL</a>) diversification away from China amid geopolitical risks has led the company to turn its attention toward India in a big way. CEO <strong>Tim Cook </strong>will be opening <a href="http://in.benzinga.com/content/31822810/apples-first-retail-store-may-be-coming-now-but-tim-cook-wants-you-to-remember-iphone-makers-long-hi">the company&rsquo;s first two retail stores</a> in Mumbai and Delhi this week, as first <a href="https://in.benzinga.com/">reported by Benzinga India.</a></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>The Apple Analyst: </strong>Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating and $205 price target for Apple shares.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>The Apple Thesis: </strong>Apple currently has a small presence in India, with the <a href="https://in.benzinga.com/content/31823509/apples-india-expansion-plans-are-off-to-a-flyer-even-before-all-chips-are-laid-as-revenue-soars-to-6">country accounting for about $6 billion or less than 2% of the company&rsquo;s global revenue, </a>Ives noted. This dynamic will change as the company eyes aggressive expansion in India from both production and retail expansion perspectives over the coming years, he said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>This &ldquo;will be a strategic poker move for Cupertino&rdquo; that could ramp annual revenue from India to $20 billion by 2025, he added.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Apple, the analyst said, will challenge the dominance of Samsung and Chines players such as Xiaomi and Vivo in India. The tech giant is likely to take a page out of the historically successful strategy of Chinese manufacturers in penetrating India with price points across the broad plan, he said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>See Also:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://in.benzinga.com/content/30443082/top-10-richest-people-in-india-right-now"><em>Top 10 Richest People In India In April 2023</em></a></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The opening of retail stores in major cities will be vital to courting more Indian consumers into the Apple ecosystem, Ives said. Apple&rsquo;s retail strategy, according to the analyst, will not only get new customers but more importantly, convert Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo customers.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Apple will follow up on the retail strategy by producing more iPhones in India, the analyst said.
