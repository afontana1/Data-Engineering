<p>Cannabis consumers often insisted that&nbsp;weed inspires their creativity and helps with concentration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The Washington Post noted that a variety of well-known geniuses and&nbsp;luminaries have also&nbsp;endorsed this idea, including co-founder and CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AAPL">AAPL</a>)&nbsp;Steve Jobs who famously said weed made&nbsp;him feel &ldquo;relaxed and creative.&rdquo; Astronomer and author Carl Sagan also believed cannabis helps produce &ldquo;serenity and insight.&rdquo; And then there&#39;s Tesla (NASDAQ:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/TSLA">TSLA</a>)&nbsp;and Twitter&nbsp;CEO Elon Musk who <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/02/30727642/elon-musk-tweets-a-simple-yet-powerful-pro-marijuana-message-reaches-millions-around-the-world">has dabbled in the plant</a> and generally expressed his approval.&nbsp;And let us not forget&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/11/29844467/louis-armstrong-loved-cannabis-and-didnt-care-who-knew-it-new-documentary-looks-at-jazz-legends-">Louis Armstrong</a>&nbsp;and Bing Crosby who were outspoken on the importance cannabis played in their music and lives.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Despite these popular beliefs about the creative potency of cannabis, scientific consensus has remained hazy.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The Washington Post reported that&nbsp;new research&nbsp;suggests cannabis may not open the door&nbsp;to creativity after all.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;Almost everyone thinks that cannabis makes them more creative. And it seems like that assumption is not supported by the data,&rdquo; said study author&nbsp;Christopher Barnes, professor of organizational behavior at the University of Washington&rsquo;s Foster School of Business.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Cannabis Improves Mood But Not Necessarily Creativity</strong></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Researchers originally hypothesized that cannabis would indirectly increase creativity by making users feel more cheerful and relaxed.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>To test this idea, they designed a randomized controlled trial with 107 volunteers who just consumed weed lightly and compared their creative outputs against those who had not.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>For the control group, the researchers asked 84 other participants to do a task only if they had not used cannabis in the past 12 hours, presumably after the effects would have worn off.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>For the creativity test, the participants were asked to consider a brick&nbsp;and generate as many creative uses as possible for it in four minutes.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>As expected, participants under the influence were in a better mood and more jovial, which made them <em>feel</em> like their ideas were more creative than their<strong>&nbsp;</strong>not-stoned&nbsp;counterparts.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>However, creativity assessments by third-party raters, who did not know who was under the influence, were a buzzkill, noted WaPo. When they rated the responses on novelty and usefulness, they did not see a difference in creativity.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo: Benziinga edit with Gleti and Stockbusters on Shutterstock</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
