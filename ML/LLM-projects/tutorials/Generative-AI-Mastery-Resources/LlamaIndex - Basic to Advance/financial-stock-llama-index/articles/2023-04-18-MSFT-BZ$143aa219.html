<p>Artificial intelligence is among the biggest trends in 2023, led by the increase use cases powered by ChatGPT and its parent company <strong>OpenAI</strong>. Credited as a co-founder and previous investor&nbsp;of OpenAI,<strong> Elon Musk </strong>is now critical of <a href="http://www.benzinga.com/topic/chatgpt">the artificial intelligence company</a>.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Artificial intelligence was a hot topic issue discussed between Musk and<strong> Tucker Carlson</strong> during <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31819763/elon-musk-and-tucker-carlson-interview-how-to-watch-and-what-topics-will-be-discussed">an interview on Fox News.</a></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>In the first of two interviews set to air on the <strong>Fox Corp </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FOX#NASDAQ">FOX</a>) (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FOXA#NASDAQ">FOXA</a>)-owned news network, Monday&rsquo;s interview saw Musk discuss artificial intelligence and OpenAI.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production, in the sense that it has the potential &ndash; however small one may regard the probability, but it is not trivial &ndash; it has the potential of civilian destruction,&rdquo; Musk said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Musk said during the interview with Carlson that he is <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31845988/elon-musk-is-worried-about-ai-posing-a-threat-to-humanity-but-prepares-to-launch-openai-rival">planning to launch</a> an OpenAI rival called &ldquo;TruthGPT.&rdquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start something which I call &lsquo;TruthGPT,&rsquo; or a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe,&rdquo; Musk said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Musk has criticized OpenAI, the company he helped co-found, for &ldquo;training the AI to lie&rdquo; and being a &ldquo;closed source&rdquo; for-profit instead of the originally planned nonprofit.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>During the interview, journalist <strong>Benny Johnson</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648174775284498432">tweeted </a>that he was watching Musk and Carlson and thought maybe Musk had been wronged by his previous involvement with OpenAI.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;Watching this fascinating Tucker v.
