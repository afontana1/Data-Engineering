If Samsung follows through on the decision, it could cost Google about $3 billion in annual revenue.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Alphabet&rsquo;s negative reaction to the news wasn&rsquo;t enough to negate the stock&rsquo;s uptrend, which it has been trading in since Feb. 24, although bullish traders will want to see Google hold above the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA).</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control, while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend, with rising lower time frame moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day EMAs) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average (SMA)) indicate a long-term uptrend.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Want direct analysis?

When Google printed its higher high, the stock also formed a bearish double top pattern at that level, which indicated Google may retrace.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><ul>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>On Monday, Google looked to be printing an inverted hammer candlestick, which suggests the stock may rebound on Tuesday. If that happens, the stock is likely to regain the eight-day EMA, which would give bullish traders more confidence going forward.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Bearish traders want to see increasing bearish volume come in to drop the stock under $104, which would negate the uptrend and cause a possible downtrend to form. If that happens, Google may continue lower to back test the 200-day SMA as support.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Google has resistance above at $106.53 and $111.50 and support below at $101.08 and $97.79.</li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><img alt="goog_apr17.png" src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/u278075/goog_apr17.png" style="height:427px; width:760px" /></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/government/23/04/31808170/tiktok-ban-or-not-kids-in-several-states-wont-be-able-to-use-social-media-without-parental-permissio">TikTok Ban Or Not, Kids In Several States Won&#39;t Be Able To Use Social Media Without Parental Permission</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
