<ul>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong>Truist</strong>&nbsp;analyst Joel P. Fishbein Jr. reiterates a Buy rating on&nbsp;<strong>GitLab Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GTLB#NASDAQ">GTLB</a>) with a&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/GTLB/analyst-ratings" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">price target of $50</a>.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The Supply Chain Management (SCM) market has been a critical area of focus in the analyst&#39;s coverage following&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Corp&#39;s</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>) investment in OpenAI and the rollout of their Copilot tool for code suggestions.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Last week, GitLab quietly rolled out the public beta version of their code suggestions tool.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>From the analyst&#39;s industry conversations, he believes that GitLab can create a substantial competitor to Copilot and sees a full-scale release sometime this summer.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>He also thinks that partnerships will factor into their AI strategy and likely work with other more prominent players.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Importantly, none of the enterprise IT customers or sellers he spoke with have fully adopted Copilot into large-scale production environments. He believes that there are hurdles in security, governance, and compliance that will prevent this at the enterprise level in 2023.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The pricing changes that GitLab rolled out in early April are the critical driver in the fundamental story for the company from here.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Over the following year, as the renewals come through, he anticipates that the potential ARR uplift from the intermediate pricing for Premium customers alone could drive as much as $50 million - $70 million in ARR upside to current Street numbers through FY25.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Although it is too early to know the full impacts of the pricing change, he notes that the company did not allow early renewals, which removes a pull-forward effect from current customers in 1Q24 and smooths the model trajectory in FY25.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The pricing increase and the reduction in workforce in February could drive leverage on the bottom line.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The analyst estimates an annualized benefit of $27 million per year, and the upside from new pricing could drive positive FCF by the end of FY24.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>He believes the structural uplift to the top and bottom lines from the pricing increase will drive a beat-and-raise cadence from the company through FY25.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong>Price Action:</strong>&nbsp;GTLB shares traded higher by 1.98% at $32.98 on the last check Monday.</li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br> <p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
