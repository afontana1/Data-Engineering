Cobalt, a critical material used in most consumer electronics products, enables high energy density and ensures safety and longevity.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Apple noted that its <strong>iPhone disassembly robot Daisy</strong> separates batteries from other components and enables specialty recyclers to recover cobalt and other materials, including lithium.</p><br><br><br><br><p>As the demand for consumer electronics and electric vehicles rise, recycling and ethical mining become increasingly important. Battery recyclers are in focus as the industry shifts towards environmental consciousness and clean energy.</p><br><br><br><br><p><em>See Also<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-renewable-energy-stocks">: Renewable Energy Stocks</a></em></p><br><br><br><br><p><strong>Here is a compilation of battery-recycling companies that could benefit from the trend:</strong></p><br><br><br><br><p><strong>1.
