<p>A driven woman&nbsp;who lost her parents as a child went from living without running water or electricity in Africa to living&nbsp;in her dream home in the U.S. in just a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/23/03/31555297/7-steps-to-millionaire-by-35">few years&#39; time</a>.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>What To Know:</strong> <strong>Yamundow Camara</strong> grew up in West Africa, living in a home without running water or electricity. Now she&#39;s a millionaire managing more than $2 million in real estate, according to a MarketWatch <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-woman-went-from-living-without-electricity-and-running-water-to-owning-over-2-million-worth-of-real-estate-heres-how-she-did-it-9900fece?link=sfmw_fb&amp;fbclid=IwAR07GbaxLSr4iBWRrkEzrfSxVk3fkRITO3KRZntUDZlBwvRmYWiOWLoE_LU">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Camara made her way to the U.S. in 2016 through a fellowship program. She studied at Northwestern University and the University of Illinois before landing a job in 2019. One year later, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and she started looking for properties to buy.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>She got the idea to start investing in real estate by reading books, listening to podcasts and watching <strong>Alphabet Inc&#39;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ">GOOG</a>)(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ">GOOGL</a>)&nbsp;YouTube videos in her free time.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>She was&nbsp;motivated to do all she could to &quot;change her life.&quot;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>She had an <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entrepreneurship">entrepreneurial mindset</a> since her childhood. She used to sell fruit and African fabrics as a kid. In 2020, she bought her first rental property (a triplex) for $52,000.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>She had $8,000 in savings and after cold-calling several banks, she was able to land a loan to cover the rest of the cost. After putting in a lot of work,&nbsp;the property started generating income.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>When the bank that gave her the first loan&nbsp;saw she had turned the property into a significant source of cash flow, they were willing to give her another mortgage.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>This time around she bought a duplex for $68,000 and she was able to replicate her success, so she kept at it.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Camara wasn&#39;t scared off by rundown properties. Her current <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/real-estate-investing">real estate portfolio</a>&nbsp;includes a $41,000 home she had to spend close to $50,000&nbsp;renovating and a fire-damaged&nbsp;home she acquired for $15,000.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>She buys the properties and rents them out in several different ways. Some of her tenants are in 12-month leases, others are renting with Section 8 government assistance and some are even travel nurses who rent&nbsp;for about a month at a time.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>She furnishes the locations with relatively cheap furniture that she finds on <strong>Amazon.com, Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ">AMZN</a>) and sometimes even decor that she makes herself.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Check This Out:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31427264/creative-29-year-old-makes-22k-a-month-working-less-than-2-hours-a-day">Creative 29-Year-Old Makes $22K A Month Working &#39;Less Than 2 Hours A Day&#39;</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>She hired a team to do a lot of the maintenance work so she just focuses on investing in new properties.&nbsp;In total, her properties have the potential to generate up to $80,000 per month.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Camara continued to save a lot of money by living well below her means and she just closed on her dream house in November. With a net worth of more than $1 million, she is also able to give back. She takes care of some of her&nbsp;family members and she donates to orphanages in Africa.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>She attributes her success to God, but also to the resources she was able to access in the U.S. including various social media sites and YouTube.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;There&rsquo;s so many people you can follow and learn from,&quot; Camara said.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31868430/from-lineman-to-laundromat-millionaire-how-craigslist-and-clothes-cleaning-changed-this-mans-life">From Lineman To &#39;Laundromat Millionaire&#39;: How Craigslist And Clothes Cleaning Changed This Man&#39;s Life</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>This story is part of a series of features on the subject of success,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/benzinga-inspire" target="_blank"><strong><em>Benzinga Inspire</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Image created with artificial intelligence using MidJourney</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
