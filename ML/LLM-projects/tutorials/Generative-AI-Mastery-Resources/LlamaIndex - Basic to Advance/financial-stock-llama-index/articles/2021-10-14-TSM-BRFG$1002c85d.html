<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM +2%)</strong> is receiving fabulous praise today for its solid Q3 earnings report, in which the company beat estimates for EPS and revenues. The major story today is that TSM expects supply to remain tight in 2021 and throughout 2022. In addition, TSM is increasing its inventory levels above historical seasonal levels, indicating that the company is stockpiling chips, betting on sustained demand moving forward. This bet could turn sour if supply chains begin returning to normalcy or if TSM's current chips become obsolete too quickly. </p><p>However, TSM downplayed these concerns during the call by pointing to ongoing structural megatrends, such as the explosion in 5G and high-performance computing (HPC). The company expects these trends to continue over the long term, which should help cushion TSM against a possible reversal in chip demand. </p><ul><li>In Q3, TSM reported EPS growth of 13.7% yr/yr to NT$6.03, topping analyst expectations by NT$0.25. Revs continued to grow by double-digits for the seventh consecutive quarter, jumping 16.3% yr/yr to NT$414.67 bln, also beating consensus. Gross margin increased considerably at 1300 bps sequentially to 51.3%, remaining above TSM's long-term target of at least 50%. </li><li>The largest revenue driver in Q3 was internet-of-things (IoT) devices. IoT revs soared 23% sequentially to NT$37.32 bln. Many industries are seeing IoT become a significant component of their businesses. For example, at connected healthcare company <strong>Hill-rom (HRC)</strong>, connected devices made up over a third of total revenue in the company's most recent quarter, up from just 20% one year ago. In addition, one of TSM's larger customers, <strong>Qualcomm (QCOM)</strong>, saw its IoT segment experience explosive growth of 83% yr/yr in the quarter ending June 30. </li><li>All but one of TSM's other segments also experienced sequential growth in Q3. TSM's largest segment, Smartphones, grew revs by 15%. TSM's next largest segment, HPC, rose 9%. But perhaps most notably, Automotive grew sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter, seeing 5% growth in Q3. </li><li> Regarding Automotive, TSM stated that it expects supply shortages for its automotive customers to be "greatly reduced" starting this quarter. The company also mentioned that its part in the global automotive integrated circuit market is only about 15%, meaning that TSM's ability to supply its customers would only play a small role in helping automotive manufacturers keep up with demand. </li></ul><p> Overall, semiconductors will remain in short supply for at least the rest of 2021 and, as TSM has indicated, more than likely throughout 2022. However, long-term trends point to a sustained robust semiconductor market, especially as the pandemic accelerated the need to go digital, driving up demand for chips in many different industries. Investors also appear to be shrugging off what looks to be an effort by TSM to stockpile chips. However, this is a slight concern to us, as technology constantly evolves, with lifespans getting shorter. This is especially true in the automotive industry, where electric vehicle tech becomes outdated after just one year. </p><p> Nonetheless, we think that the megatrends TSM pointed to, such as 5G and HPC, should sustain the demand for TSM's products and their technological advantages over products from competitors such as <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> over the long term. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
