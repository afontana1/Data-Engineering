Why should we stay at Meta?&rdquo; the employee asked.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Zuckerberg told employees he hopes they are with the company because they believe in the future vision.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other company in the world that delivers social experiences at the scale that we are and that does so across such a diversity of different products and use cases. So if you want to reach people in the billions and have a massive impact, I think this is a great place to be,&rdquo; Zuckerberg said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>One of the questions was related to bonuses for Meta executives, which comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31919688/ceo-who-told-employees-to-leave-pity-city-offers-apology-for-rallying-cry-employees-tell-media-they">another company going viral </a>for its CEO addressing bonuses.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;Why did the entire executive team get EE/GE ratings when they are also directly responsible for the choices that led to us needing to lay off 20+% of the company? Where is the accountability?&rdquo; the employee asked.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Zuckerberg told the employee he was happy with the performance of the executives in their new and expanded roles that have changed due to job cuts.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The comments from employees come in the wake of a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31444211/please-resign-immediately-before-we-find-out-who-you-are-anyway-leaked-2010-email-from-mark-zuckerbe">2010 email from Zuckerberg </a>to employees about leaking information to the press.
