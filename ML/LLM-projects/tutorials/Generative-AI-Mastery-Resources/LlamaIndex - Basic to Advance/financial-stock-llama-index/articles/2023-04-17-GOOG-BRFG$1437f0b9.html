<html><body><p><strong>Alphabet (GOOG -2%)</strong> is sinking toward its 20-day moving average (105.07) today on a <em>New York Times</em> report that tech giant <strong>Samsung (SSNLF)</strong> may replace Google Search with <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> Bing as the default search engine across its devices. The news definitely comes as a shock given GOOG's stronghold in the search engine space, being synonymous with the word "search." The <em>NYT </em>reported that an estimated $3 bln in annual revenue is on the line with its deal with Samsung. A possible domino effect would be even more worrisome, as Samsung's move could encourage <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> to do the same. The <em>NYT </em>noted that the contract between AAPL and GOOG, worth $20 bln, is up for renewal this year.</p><ul><li> Samsung's move would be more than a monetary blow to GOOG. By potentially switching from Google to Bing, Samsung is signaling MSFT's lead in the AI race. Bing recently incorporated artificial intelligence (AI), using OpenAI's technology (the same that powers ChatGPT) to give users a chatbot to answer queries in a conversational style in an effort to provide better results to more complicated questions. </li><li>GOOG is not relying on its rich history to remain competitive. However, its AI chatbot, Bard, did not get off to a good start. In February, GOOG's new chatbot provided inaccurate information during a promo video, causing shares to plummet, declining by roughly 12% in the two days following. That event sparked worry amongst investors that GOOG was losing its dominant positioning within the online search industry to MSFT. </li><li>Although shares recovered over the next couple of months, today's news illustrates that the wind may have already shifted. Many competitors are popping up within the AI space, jeopardizing GOOG's decades-long dominance among online search engines. However, the real blow would occur if AAPL decided not to renew its contract. </li></ul><p>Despite today's report sparking some fear regarding GOOG's competitive positioning, we do not see GOOG giving up much market share even if Samsung makes Bing its default search engine. Before 2009, when GOOG launched its Android OS, which is used on Samsung's mobile devices, its search engine market share hovered around 60%, crushing Bing's estimated ~9%. Additionally, the Bard setback notwithstanding, GOOG is emphasizing AI development, making it the underlying driver behind its top long-term priorities: Search, ads, YouTube, Cloud, and Pixel.</p><p>  Therefore, although MSFT's AI developments may be beating GOOG to the punch, its current focus and history suggest that it is not too far behind and could quickly surpass MSFT. Since shares are still trading close to YTD highs, the market is also not overly concerned.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
