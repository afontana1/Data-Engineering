<ul>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong>Mizuho&nbsp;</strong>analyst James Lee reiterates a Buy rating on&nbsp;<strong>Alphabet Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ">GOOG</a>) (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ">GOOGL</a>)&nbsp;<strong>Google&nbsp;</strong>and a&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/GOOGL/analyst-ratings" style="color:#4a6ee0; background:transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt" target="_blank">price target of $135.00</a>.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Mizuho&#39;s recent agency checks indicated that advertising remained challenging from elevated inflation and tighter consumer budgets.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Heading into the rest of FY23, he expects advertisers to optimize their ad spending, focusing on targeting existing customers that provide a higher LTV. Lifetime Value or LTV is an estimate of the average revenue that a customer will generate throughout their lifespan as a customer.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>However, consensus ad revenue growth of 3.4% YoY appears reasonable, the analyst says in a Friday note titled &quot;<strong>Ad Revenue Checks Mixed, but Further Cost Reductions on the Horizon; Maintain Buy.</strong>&quot;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Mizuho&#39;s recent industry call with a leading SEO firm indicated that Generative AI would have a limited impact on search market share given the limited commercial use cases and Google&#39;s significant infrastructure advantage over its peers.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Lee estimates Alphabet could reduce its cost base by $7.5 billion in FY24, or 2.2% of revenues, through the combination of renewable energy consolidation, employee reductions, and operating expense optimization, which could generate an upside of 8% to FY24 consensus operating income.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>He sees a limited downside to FY23 revenue growth and cost optimization efforts on the horizon and likes the setup into the quarter.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong>Price Action:</strong>&nbsp;GOOG shares traded lower by 0.27% at $105.61 on the last check Friday.</li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br> <p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
