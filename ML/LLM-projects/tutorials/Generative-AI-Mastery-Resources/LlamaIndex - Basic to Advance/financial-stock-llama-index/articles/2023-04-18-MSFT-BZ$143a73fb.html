<p><strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>) opened slightly higher Tuesday as traders and investors prepare for the kickoff into big tech earnings, starting with Netflix, which will report its first quarter results <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings">after the market close</a>.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>At the high-of-day, Microsoft ran into a group of sellers who knocked the stock down under Monday&rsquo;s closing price. The move came in tandem with the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>, which was edging lower after opening the trading day positive.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>From a technical analysis perspective, Microsoft formed a bearish <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/stock-chart-patterns">triple top pattern</a> near the $292 level, which has negated the stock&rsquo;s uptrend for the time being.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>A double top pattern is a reversal indicator that shows a stock has reached a key resistance level, retraced, back tested the level as resistance and is likely to drop again. It is possible the stock may retest the level as resistance again, creating a triple or even quadruple top pattern.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The formation is always identified after a security has risen in price and is at the top of an uptrend, whereas a bullish double bottom pattern is always found in a downtrend. A spike in volume confirms the double top pattern was recognized and subsequent increasing volume may indicate the stock will reverse into a downtrend.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Want direct analysis?

The pattern caused Microsoft to fall on increasing volume on lower time frames, indicating the formation was recognized.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><ul>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>When Microsoft edged lower, the stock was attempting to hold support at the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA). Bullish traders want to see that indicator hold as support because the eight-day EMA has been guiding Microsoft higher since March 15.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>If Microsoft can break up above $292 over the coming days, there&rsquo;s an upper gap between $292 and $296 that is likely to fill. If that occurs, bearish traders can watch to see if the stock rejects at the upper range of the gap and prints a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-read-candlestick-charts">bearish reversal candlestick</a> at that level.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Microsoft has resistance above at $289.69 and $294.23 and support below at $283.11 and $276.90.</li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><img alt="msft_apr_18.png" src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/u278075/msft_apr_18.png" style="height:427px; width:760px" /><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31857656/ai-chip-rumors-whats-going-on-with-microsoft-stock-today">AI Chip Rumors: What&#39;s Going On With Microsoft Stock Today?</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo via Pixabay.&nbsp;</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
