<p>On March 31, China launched a cybersecurity review of&nbsp;<strong>Micron Technology, Inc&#39;s</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MU#NASDAQ">MU</a>) export products to ensure the security of its information infrastructure supply chain, prevent network security risks, and maintain national security.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>China&#39;s move intensified the already tense environment with the U.S. since it cut down China&#39;s access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology by slapping embargoes on the country.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Recent reports suggested that China&#39;s cybersecurity review of Micron is not affecting its ability&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/government/23/04/31648858/microns-operations-unaffected-by-chinas-regulatory-probe-report" style="color:#4a6ee0; background:transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt" target="_blank">to deliver products</a>.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Industry insiders say Micron, which generates 11% of its revenue in mainland China and another 5% in Hong Kong, was the first likely target for Beijing as its tech was easily replaceable.
