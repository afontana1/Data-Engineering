The business in the first quarter&nbsp;of 2023 has likely hit&nbsp;bottom in terms of&nbsp;revenue, and the rest of the year is going to be positive, he said, with the Street expecting a rebound in revenues in the second quarter.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;We&rsquo;ll likely see some forms of new products.
