<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semi </strong>(<strong>TSM</strong>), the world's largest contract manufacturer of chips, continued to experience very healthy demand in Q1 as revenue jumped by 35.5% to NT$491.08 bln, easily beating analysts' expectations. The company, which reported the top-line results in an SEC filing, didn't provide any color on the specific catalysts that drove the impressive growth. However, if we rewind to March 30 when <em>Nikkei Asia</em> published an article on TSM and the health of its end markets, we can surmise where the strength originated.<br><br>Specifically, the article quoted TSM Chairman Mark Liu, who stated, "Despite the slowdown in some areas, we still see robust demand in automotive applications and high-performance computing as well as internet of things-related devices." The slowdown in some areas that Liu alluded to includes smartphones, PCs, and TVs, especially in China.<br><br>For TSM customers with an increasing presence in the auto industry, such as <strong>Broadcom</strong> (<strong>AVGO</strong>), <strong>Marvell</strong> (<strong>MRVL</strong>), and <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>), TSM's strong report is a bullish data point for when they report earnings in late May and early June. Yet, each of these stocks, along with TSM, has failed to gain any upward traction today.&nbsp;<br><br>There are a few possible explanations for the weakness.</p><ul><li>Technology is a lagging sector today as interest rates continue to push higher. High growth companies that have benefitted the most from low rates, such as those in the semiconductor industry, are under pressure as earnings expectations come down.&nbsp;</li><li>Supply chain woes are not materially improving. In fact, they seem to be worsening as COVID cases continue to rise across China, causing more factories to halt production. Accordingly, TSM and other chip companies will likely face even higher costs, while meeting demand becomes increasingly difficult.</li><li>The end result of the two points above is that inflation on the consumer level could reach new heights, potentially dampening demand for products like smartphones, PCs, and automobiles. On that note, U.S. auto sales in March tumbled by over 25% yr/yr due to inventory shortages and much higher prices.&nbsp;<em>Nikkei Asia</em> also&nbsp;recently reported that AAPL cut orders for its iPhone SE by up to 3 mln units.&nbsp;</li><li>Hong Kong-based semiconductor company <strong>Silicon Motion</strong> (<strong>SIMO</strong>) raised its Q1 guidance this morning, forecasting revenue to come in slightly above its original guidance range of $225-$238 mln. This also appears to be good news, but it's worth noting that this enhanced outlook still falls short of analysts' initial revenue estimates for the quarter.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that TSM generated strong growth once again in Q1 as the leading chip maker struggles to keep up with demand. Investors are looking beyond the current quarter, though, to assess how higher interest rates and worsening supply chain dynamics may weigh on earnings growth for the semiconductor industry.&nbsp;</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
