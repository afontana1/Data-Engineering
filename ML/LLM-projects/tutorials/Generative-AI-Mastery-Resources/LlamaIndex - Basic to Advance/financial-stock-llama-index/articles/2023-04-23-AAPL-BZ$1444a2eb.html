<p>The <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/iphone">iPhone </a>made its public debut in 2007, when&nbsp;<strong>Apple Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ">AAPL</a>) co-founder <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>&nbsp;presented&nbsp;the revolutionary device to the world. Before it became a huge success for Apple and one of the top-selling phones worldwide, many &mdash; including one big rival &mdash;&nbsp;were skeptical about&nbsp;how well the&nbsp;iPhone would sell.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The iPhone <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/20/01/11007650/this-day-in-market-history-apple-introduces-the-iphone-1">made its debut</a>&nbsp;during Jobs&#39;&nbsp;MacWorld keynote address on Jan. 9, 2007. The phone would go on sale later that year and become one of the biggest revenue drivers for Apple and a huge part of the <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/01/30336631/the-iphone-was-unveiled-16-years-ago-heres-how-much-1-000-invested-in-apple-stock-after-the-debut-is">company&rsquo;s later&nbsp;success.</a></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>During the keynote, Jobs said that &ldquo;every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.&rdquo; The Apple CEO at the time said that the iPhone combined three products: a mobile phone, a widescreen iPod and internet communications.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;iPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any mobile phone. We are all born with the ultimate pointing device &mdash;&nbsp;our fingers &mdash;&nbsp;and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse.&rdquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>One of the many people who had a<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/01/24963412/apple-rivals-microsoft-blackberry-nokia-laughed-at-iphone-shrugged-it-off-and-flung-it-to-the-ground"> huge reaction</a> to the iPhone unveiling was <strong>Steve Ballmer</strong>, who was then the CEO of rival <strong>Microsoft Corporation </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ">MSFT</a>).</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>During an interview with CNBC, Ballmer was asked for his reaction to the&nbsp;iPhone unveiling.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;Five hundred dollars! Fully subsidized with a plan! I said that is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn&rsquo;t appeal to business guys because it doesn&rsquo;t have a keyboard,&rdquo; Ballmer famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U">said</a>.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Ballmer said the iPhone could end up selling well&nbsp;but told CNBC&nbsp;that he liked Microsoft&rsquo;s chances in the smartphone market.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;We have our strategy. I like our strategy. I like it a lot,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Ballmer went on to say that Microsoft was selling &ldquo;millions and millions and millions of phones a year&rdquo; and Apple was selling zero at the time, adding that it was premature to call the&nbsp;iPhone&nbsp;a success.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;Six months, they&rsquo;ll have the most expensive phone by far even in the marketplace, and ...&nbsp;let&rsquo;s see how the competition does.&rdquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Microsoft would later exit the smartphone business in 2016.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>While Ballmer was not the only competitor to poke fun at the iPhone,&nbsp;his comments remain among the&nbsp;most famous made about a rival over the years.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>In a later interview, Ballmer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-11-04/ballmer-i-ve-kinda-drifted-apart-from-bill-gates">admitted&nbsp;</a>he was wrong and went so far as to&nbsp;say that&nbsp;he wished he had thought of some ideas himself.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;I wish I had thought of the model of subsidizing phones thorough the operators,&rdquo; Ballmer said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Related Link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/02/30805574/apple-users-want-to-enhance-your-iphone-experience-here-are-5-game-changing-hacks-1">5 Game-Changing iPhone Hacks YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss Recommended In This Viral Video</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Investing $1,000 In Apple Stock:</strong> The unveiling of the iPhone was a major event &mdash; and&nbsp;Ballmer&#39;s comments may have led some investors to be&nbsp;skeptical of the company&#39;s product&nbsp;due to&nbsp;its price. Others, however,&nbsp;may have recognized that Apple was onto something.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>An investor could have bought 303.95 shares of Apple on Jan 17, 2007, the day of Ballmer&rsquo;s original interview, based&nbsp;on a split adjusted price of $3.29.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>That $1,000 investment would be worth $50,157.83 today, based on a price of $165.02 for Apple shares at the time of writing. This represents a return of 4,9515.7% over the last 16 years.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>An investor&nbsp;who believed more strongly&nbsp;in&nbsp;Microsoft&#39;s future, however, would have made less today. A $1,000 investment in Microsoft stock on the day of Ballmer&#39;s interview&nbsp;would be worth $9,090.03 today, gaining 809% over the last 16 years.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Although Apple has beaten Microsoft over the last 16 years by a significant margin in terms of stock returns, both stocks have&nbsp;significantly outpaced the S&amp;P 500, as tracked by the S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>An investor who purchased $1,000 in SPY stock when Ballmer made the comments would have $2,873.03 today, a gain of 187.3%.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Read Next: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/23/04/31948086/if-you-invested-1000-in-microsoft-stock-when-bill-gates-explained-the-internet-to-david-letterm" style="font-size: 13px;">If You Invested $1,000 In Microsoft Stock When Bill Gates Explained The Internet To David Letterman, Here&#39;s How Much You&#39;d Have Today&nbsp;</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
