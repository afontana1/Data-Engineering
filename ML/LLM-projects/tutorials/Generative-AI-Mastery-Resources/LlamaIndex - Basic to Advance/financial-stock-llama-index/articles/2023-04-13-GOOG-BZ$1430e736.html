Disney+ had a decent 10% showing in Canada, but got only 7% in the United States.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>With many consumers having more than one streaming platform, the results would indicate that the ranking would be Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube and Disney+.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Read Next:<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/04/26914727/netflix-disney-hulu-or-hbo-max-which-streaming-platform-do-benzinga-users-prefer"> Netflix, Disney+, Hulu Or HBO Max, Which Streaming Platform Do Benzinga Users Prefer&nbsp;</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
