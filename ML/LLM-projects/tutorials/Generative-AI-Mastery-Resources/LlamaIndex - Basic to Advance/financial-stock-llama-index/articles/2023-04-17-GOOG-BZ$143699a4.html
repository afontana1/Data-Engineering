GM would customize the touch-screen interface with GM&#39;s own branded look and features.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The software will be able to collect data on the vehicle&#39;s electric charge and tire pressure and make suggestions, including adding a suggested route to Google Maps for drivers who want to use the hands-free Super Cruise assisted driving system. GM said CarPlay and Android Auto could not offer such services.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>GM looks to launch its new display-screen software on the Chevrolet Blazer electric SUV, set to go on sale this summer. The automaker will continue offering CarPlay and Android Auto on its gas- and diesel-engine vehicles and a few EVs.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Reportedly, the plan to reach more deeply into the vehicle&#39;s controls was a factor in GM&#39;s decision to ditch CarPlay on future models.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong>Price Action:</strong>&nbsp;GM shares traded higher by 0.32% at $34.60 premarket on the last check Monday.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><em>Photo via Wikimedia Commons</em></li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br> <p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
