<p>NVIDIA today announced the GeForce RTX&trade; 4070 GPU, delivering all the advancements of the NVIDIA&reg;&nbsp;Ada Lovelace architecture &mdash; including DLSS 3 neural rendering, real-time ray-tracing technologies and the ability to run most modern games at over 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution &mdash; starting at&nbsp;$599.</p><br><br><p>Today&#39;s PC gamers increasingly want super-premium visual experiences, with&nbsp;83%&nbsp;of GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop gamers enabling ray tracing and&nbsp;79%&nbsp;turning on DLSS, a revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered graphics that massively boosts performance, now in its third generation.</p><br><br><p>&quot;Making sure games are &lsquo;RTX ON&#39; with both ray tracing and DLSS has become a top priority for the majority of PC gamers,&quot; said Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. &quot;With prices starting at&nbsp;$599, the RTX 4070 is an amazing upgrade for gamers running on previous-generation GPUs.&quot;</p><br><br><p><strong>Play at 100+ FPS at 1440p with DLSS 3</strong><br /><br><br /><br>The RTX 4070 allows the latest games such as&nbsp;<em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>,&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em>&nbsp;and other demanding titles to run at over 100 frames per second, thanks to DLSS 3, as well as popular games such as&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy</em>&nbsp;that support DLSS 2.</p><br><br><p>With DLSS 3, AI-powered frame generation creates new, high-quality frames for smoother gameplay, rendering seven out of every eight pixels in a scene. Exceptional responsiveness is maintained through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-low-latency-platform/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Reflex</a>, which reduces input lag between devices and monitors.</p><br><br><p>Ray-tracing performance has also significantly improved, thanks to advancements like Shader Execution Reordering (SER), cutting-edge Opacity Micromap, and Displaced Micro-Mesh Engines. These innovations enable even the most demanding games to simultaneously implement multiple ray-tracing effects or even full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, for unparalleled realism and immersion.</p><br><br><p>This potent combination of third-generation ray tracing and DLSS has resulted in a 16x leap in ray-tracing operations per pixel over the past five years. Adoption rates have soared, with over 400 RTX games and applications available, with adoption of DLSS 3 happening 7x faster than its predecessor.</p><br><br><p><strong>Class-Leading Performance and Features</strong><br /><br><br /><br>Compared to the RTX 2070 SUPER, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on average 2.6x faster with DLSS 3, and on average 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3.</p><br><br><p>DLSS 3 provides Ada Lovelace GPUs with a tremendous performance boost, but the GeForce RTX 4070 also excels in traditional games that do not include more advanced features such as ray tracing and DLSS.</p><br><br><p>In these rasterized games, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on par with the GeForce RTX 3080 while running at nearly half the power &mdash; and offering an additional 2GB of memory. Additionally, the RTX 4070&#39;s memory subsystem has been enhanced with 36MB of L2 cache and 12GB of ultra-high-speed GDDR6X memory.</p><br><br><p><strong>Perfect for Content Creators</strong><br /><br><br /><br>The GeForce RTX 4070 GPU comes backed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Studio platform</a>, which enables content creators to work faster and smarter with RTX acceleration and AI tools. Serving creators from livestreamers to video editors, the platform supercharges 100 creative apps, provides lasting stability with NVIDIA Studio Drivers and includes a powerful suite of Studio apps, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/omniverse/creators/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Omniverse</a>&trade;,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/canvas/" target="_blank">Canvas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/" target="_blank">Broadcast</a>.</p><br><br><p>3D modelers rendering 4K scenes with the AI-powered DLSS 3 in NVIDIA Omniverse &mdash; a hub to interconnect existing 3D workflows, replacing linear pipelines with live-sync creation for real-time collaboration &mdash; can expect 2.8x faster performance than with last generation&#39;s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.</p><br><br><p>Broadcasters deploying the eighth-generation NVIDIA video encoder NVENC, with support for AV1, will enjoy&nbsp;40%&nbsp;better efficiency. Livestreams will appear as if bitrate was increased by&nbsp;40%&nbsp;&mdash; a big boost in image quality for popular broadcast apps like OBS Studio. AV1 is already supported in Discord with a full release coming to YouTube via OBS Studio soon.</p><br><br><p>Video editors will see&nbsp;20%&nbsp;faster video export speeds, thanks to the eighth-generation NVIDIA encoder on the GeForce RTX 4070, along with AV1 incorporated into top video editing apps.<br /><br>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>And all creators can benefit from the new fourth-generation Tensor Cores for AI tools, providing a significant performance increase from the last generation.</p><br><br><p><strong>Where to Buy</strong><br /><br><br /><br>The GeForce RTX 4070 will be available starting tomorrow at&nbsp;$599.</p><br><br><p>An NVIDIA Founders Edition design will be available directly from NVIDIA.com and select retailers. Custom boards, including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models, will be available from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC.</p><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
