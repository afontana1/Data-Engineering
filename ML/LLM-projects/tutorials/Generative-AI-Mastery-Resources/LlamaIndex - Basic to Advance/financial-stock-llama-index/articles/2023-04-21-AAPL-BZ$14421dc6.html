The app will likely offer &quot;All Day People Discovery&quot; to detect a user&#39;s physical proximity to other people.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Apple&#39;s documents said privacy and security would be central to the software&#39;s design.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The app is ready to work with all iPhone hardware with Apple&#39;s coming operating system, iOS 17, code-named Dawn. Apple could announce the Jurassic app by its June developer conference.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>For Paul Mayne, founder of the Day One app, Apple entering the journaling space will imply more differentiation of his product to sustain the competition.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Founded in 2011, Day One focused its software primarily on Apple&#39;s iPhone and Mac. It grew mainly because of Apple&#39;s support, Mayne said. About three years ago, Day One support from Apple dropped off suddenly, Mayne said.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong>Price Action:</strong>&nbsp;AAPL shares traded lower by 0.40% at $165.99 on the last check Friday.</li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br> <p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
