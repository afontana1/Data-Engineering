<p><strong>Jim Cramer </strong>sees more layoffs are on the horizon &mdash; and it could be bad news for anyone betting against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AMZN"><strong>Amazon.com&nbsp;Inc</strong></a> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ">AMZN</a>).</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>What To Know:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Meta Platforms&nbsp;Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ">META</a>) has deemed 2023 &quot;the year of efficiency&quot; and it&#39;s working out well for shareholders. Just a few months after cutting about 13% of its workforce, Meta announced another round of <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31309130/meta-plans-more-layoffs-in-key-projects-likely-to-match-job-cut-numbers-from-2022-report">job cuts</a> last month. The stock is up more than 75% year-to-date.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Cramer said this trend is going to continue among big tech firms and he said Amazon stock could see a huge lift from continued layoffs. The e-commerce giant has already announced two rounds of job cuts in recent months, but many viewed&nbsp;the layoffs as&nbsp;somewhat trivial given the massive size of its workforce.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Although Amazon shares are up 20% since the start of the year, the stock has been trending lower for a large part of the last two years and it&#39;s trading close to where it was five years ago.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>At these levels, Cramer suggested&nbsp;Amazon is a death trap for short sellers. If Amazon wakes up one day and decides to eliminate close to&nbsp;50,000 jobs, the stock is likely to move significantly higher, he said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;I think Amazon is the most dangerous short there is today,&quot; Cramer said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;You short that ...&nbsp;send me an invitation to your funeral.&quot;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>From Last Week:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/04/31657391/amazon-forms-bullish-pattern-while-consolidating-sideways-the-bull-bear-case-for-the-tec">Amazon Forms Bullish Pattern While Consolidating Sideways: The Bull, Bear Case For The Tech Giant</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Amazon laid off <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/01/30288156/over-18-000-amazon-workers-stand-to-lose-jobs-in-biggest-tech-layoff-yet">18,000 workers</a> in January and <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31423087/amazon-will-eliminate-9-000-more-jobs-in-coming-weeks-the-details">another 9,000</a> last month.
