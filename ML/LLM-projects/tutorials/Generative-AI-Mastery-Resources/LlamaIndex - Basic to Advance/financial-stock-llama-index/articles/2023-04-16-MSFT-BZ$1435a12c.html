<p>Each week, Benzinga compiles the latest entertainment news into a cohesive column for your consideration. Read on for the latest updates &mdash; both useful and irreverent.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><ul>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><em><strong>&quot;Woooooooo!&quot;</strong></em> Pro-wrestling legend <strong>Ric Flair</strong> and boxing legend <strong>Mike Tyson</strong> broke some news at this year&#39;s <strong>Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference</strong> in Miami. Benzinga editor <strong>Maureen Meehan</strong> <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/04/31759637/exclusive-tyson-2-0-announces-5-country-partnership-at-benzinga-cannabis-capital-conference">has the scoop on Tyson 2.0</a>.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><em>&quot;<strong>I solemnly swear I am up to no good.</strong>&quot;</em> <strong>Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.&#39;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WBD#NASDAQ">WBD</a>) is rebooting <strong>Harry Potter</strong> <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/04/31781697/harry-potter-and-game-of-thrones-shows-in-one-place-get-ready-for-warner-bros-discoverys-ma">as a TV series</a>. Author <strong>J.K. Rowling</strong> will serve as executive producer for the new show. Expect more chatter on social media <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/04/31794515/what-do-harry-potter-and-bud-light-have-in-common-kid-rock-and-j-k-rowling-have-something-t">about her views </a>on the trans community and less on the merits of a show that won&#39;t at all be compared to its beloved movie counterpart.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>&quot;<em><strong>Open any curiosity door you find</strong></em>.&quot; <strong>Netflix Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ">NFLX</a>) was never going to let &quot;Stranger Things&quot; take a bow with a fifth and final season in 2024. It&#39;s arguably the streaming giant&#39;s <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/07/27958977/breaking-stranger-things-season-4-hits-new-record-with-part-2-heres-how-many-people-watched">most popular show</a>. Now, not only is &quot;Stranger Things&quot; <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/07/27980043/dont-worry-stranger-things-fans-spinoff-series-and-more-content-coming-from-creative-team-h">getting a spinoff</a>,&nbsp; it&#39;s getting&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/04/31758894/netflix-ready-to-turn-saturday-morning-cartoons-upside-down-with-stranger-things-spinoff">Saturday morning-style cartoon</a> series as well. So, in my mind, that means the Hawkins kids will sing lots of songs that are hilarious and educational:</li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pOFKmk7ytU?start=11" width="560"></iframe></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><ul>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong><em>Who Wins The Streaming Wars?</em> </strong>Needham analyst Laura Martin weighed in on <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/04/31785578/warner-bros-vs-amazon-vs-netflix-vs-disney-analyst-picks-potential-winners-in-strea">which streaming service&nbsp;is the best</a>. In her opinion, <strong>Walt Disney Company&#39;s </strong>(NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DIS#NYSE">DIS</a>) Disney+ and <strong>Amazon, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ">AMZN</a>) Prime Video are superior to both Warner Bros. and Netflix. Laura is obviously not watching &quot;<strong>Vanderpump Rules&quot;</strong>&nbsp;because, if she was, <strong>Peacock</strong> would be the clear winner.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><em><strong>Doge You Want To See It?</strong></em> <strong>Kabosu</strong>, the dog from the meme that inspired the cryptocurrency known as<strong> Dogecoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/doge/usd">DOGE</a>), <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/04/31735745/very-documentary-much-wow-new-film-will-tell-the-story-of-kabosu-the-dogecoin-inspiration">is getting its own documentary</a>. My dog, <strong>Ernie</strong>, heard this news and was like, &quot;Kabo-who? Has Hollywood not seen your TikTok videos of me?&quot;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong><em>Jed-i Had Enough.</em> </strong>Lucasfilm president&nbsp;<strong>Kathleen Kennedy</strong> <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swce-2023-new-star-wars-films">confirmed </a>that there are at least three new<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/04/31734634/may-the-force-be-with-disneys-star-wars-future-new-movies-tv-shows-and-the-return-of-daisy-"> Star Wars films on the way</a>. For some reason, the news was announced at a Star Wars &quot;Celebration&quot; event held on April 7. Why wasn&#39;t it announced on actual &quot;Star Wars Day,&quot; which is May&nbsp;4? That would&#39;ve made more sense ... more sense than the plots of the last three Star Wars films, at least.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><em><strong>No Nintendo? No Show</strong></em>. Video game event company <strong>E3</strong> was going to throw a big gamer rager from June 13 through June 16 in Los Angeles. This was going to be its first in-person bash since COVID-19.
