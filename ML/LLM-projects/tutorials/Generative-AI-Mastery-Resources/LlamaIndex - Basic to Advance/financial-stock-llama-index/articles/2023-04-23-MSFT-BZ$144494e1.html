In an episode of &ldquo;The Late Show with David Letterman&rdquo; that aired on November 27, 1995, Gates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs-YpQj88ew">told </a>Letterman he took advantage of the opportunity, making sure that, in a school whose student body was&nbsp;80% boys and 20% girls, his classes had all girls in them.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>During the interview, Gates also explained&nbsp;Microsoft&#39;s vision and what the internet could&nbsp;do.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&ldquo;There were a small group of people who saw what this chip could do as it became more powerful. This thing is going to reach out to the entire world,&rdquo; Gates said at the time. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not to that full realization, even today.&rdquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>When asked by Letterman if he knew anything about &ldquo;this internet thing,&rdquo; the billionaire businessman responded,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s become a place where people are publishing information, so everybody can have their own home page, companies are there, the latest information, it&rsquo;s wild what&rsquo;s going on, you can send electronic mail to people. It is the big new thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>During the interview, Gates also told Letterman that Microsoft was working on making the computer a tool and that&nbsp;the company could eventually see the computer&nbsp;think on its own.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Gates&#39; appearance on the late-night talk show at the time coincided with the release of his book,&nbsp;&ldquo;The Road Ahead,&rdquo; and Microsoft&#39;s release of&nbsp;Windows 95.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>While some were skeptical of the internet back then,&nbsp;Gates&#39;s comments on its capabilities and future&nbsp;foreshadowed the company&#39;s astronomical growth in later years.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Related Link:<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/21/11/24017046/this-day-in-market-history-microsoft-introduces-windows-operating-system"> This Day In Market History: Microsoft Introduces Windows Operating System</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Investing $1,000 in Microsoft:</strong>&nbsp;Letterman&#39;s interview with&nbsp;&nbsp;Gates aired during late-night hours on November 27, 1995.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Microsoft stock opened at a split adjusted $3.57 the following morning.
