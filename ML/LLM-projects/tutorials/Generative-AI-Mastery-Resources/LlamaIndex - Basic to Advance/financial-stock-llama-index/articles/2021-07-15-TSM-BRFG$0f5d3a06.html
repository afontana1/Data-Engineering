<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM -5%)</strong> is getting chipped today after missing on Q2 earnings. This result was a surprise, as it marks the first earnings miss by TSM after eight straight quarters of decent outperformance. It is also quite the reversal from the company's $1.00+ beats during FY20. </p><p> The stock has traded mostly sideways throughout FY21 after more than doubling during FY20 when the company was posting blowout quarters. Given that impressive run, a mild quarter is not going to create much enthusiasm with investors. It also comes as a bit of a shock given all the headlines surrounding chip shortages. </p><p> As the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSM serves a broad range of end-market applications, such as smartphones (42% of revenue), high-performance computers (39%), and automotive (4%), and supplies titans in their respective industries, such as <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA (NVDA)</strong>, and <strong>GM (GM)</strong>. TSM is followed closely by the market during earnings season because its results paint a picture of conditions in the overall semiconductor space. </p><ul><li> EPS still grew 11.2% yr/yr despite missing analysts' expectations. However, this amounts to only about half the growth rate experienced in FY20. Revenue experienced healthy growth of 19.8% yr/yr to NT$372.15 bln, which was relatively in-line with the consensus. Gross margin remained at 50%, which is TSM's long-term target. </li><li> Regarding the automotive semiconductor shortage, TSM increased output for MCUs -- a key component in automotive semiconductor products -- in 1H21 by about 30% more than in 1H20. It also expects to ramp up full-year output by 60% more than in 2020. TSM cited that the production increases should significantly reduce the semiconductor shortage for its automotive customers. </li><li>Looking ahead, TSM's upside revenue guidance for Q3 is $1.45 bln more at the mid-point than consensus. Also, Q3-Q4 are typically TSM's best quarters, as during that period, one of its largest customers, Apple, rolls out new iPhones, and students begin purchasing new computers with <strong>AMD (AMD)</strong> and NVDA chipsets for the fall. </li><li> However, despite more students returning to the classrooms and new iPhones pending release this fall, we do not expect similarly-sized 2H20 EPS beats in 2H21. Many students would have purchased computers last year, as they were necessary for remote learning; plus, there isn't much new groundbreaking technology within AMD processors and NVDIA GPUs. Also, the latest iPhone 12 rollout saw similar sales figures as the iPhone 11. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, despite a decent quarter with upside guidance, the results were not good enough for investors, who may be wanting to see much larger top and bottom-line growth in light of the global chip shortage. Q2 still showed that demand is not cooling off for semiconductors. However, we think some sequential weakness in the smartphone segment, which is TSM's largest segment, may be responsible for the shortfall. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
