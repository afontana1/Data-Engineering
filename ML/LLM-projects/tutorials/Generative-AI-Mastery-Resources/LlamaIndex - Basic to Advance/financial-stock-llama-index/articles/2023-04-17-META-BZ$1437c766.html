<p>When Facebook rebranded&nbsp;to<strong>&nbsp;Meta Platforms&nbsp;Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ">META</a>) and laid out a new vision for the future of the company focused on the metaverse, many were concerned that the costs would be too high.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Although 2023 has been dubbed the &quot;year of efficiency&quot;&nbsp;for the Facebook parent,&nbsp;it turns out&nbsp;Meta is luring in&nbsp;VR employees with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31755746/amazons-pre-layoff-payroll-peek-a-boo-the-massive-salaries-of-engineers-data-scientists-managers-and">outrageous salaries</a>.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>What To Know:</strong>&nbsp;According to a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/07/meta-developer-salary-metaverse-investment/">report</a>&nbsp;citing people familiar with the matter,&nbsp;Meta is paying programmers capable of creating&nbsp;virtual reality-related tech&nbsp;abnormally high&nbsp;amounts&nbsp;ranging from&nbsp;$600,000 to&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;$1 million annually.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Meta is paying &quot;significantly more&quot; than most other&nbsp;gaming companies, according to&nbsp;<strong>Patrick McAdams</strong>, CEO of&nbsp;Andiamo, a data-driven tech recruiting&nbsp;firm.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that their total compensation is double or more than double of what you&rsquo;ll get at a large gaming company,&quot; McAdams said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Meta spent approximately $10 billion on its metaverse build out in 2021 and another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/02/30763778/meta-attempts-to-expand-its-metaverses-user-coverage-to-attract-and-retain-users-versus-rivals">$15.9 billion </a>for its Reality Labs division last year. The metaverse-focused business&nbsp;lost <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/01/30507392/metaverse-will-be-as-important-as-the-smartphone-meta-platforms-chief-product-officer">about&nbsp;$19 billion</a> over the last two years.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> It appears a significant portion of its metaverse and VR&nbsp;spending is going toward offering eye-popping pay packages to programmers. The report indicates that Meta is willing to pay &quot;unusually high salaries&quot; in order to get the best developers to work for the company instead of for competitors.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>A former recruiter for the<strong> Mark Zuckerberg</strong>-led company told the Washington Post that&nbsp;there usually wasn&#39;t much competition on the offers they made because they would &quot;pay way above market rate&quot; for several roles.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>See Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31802817/mark-zuckerberg-faces-backlash-over-plans-to-let-children-access-metaverse">Mark Zuckerberg Faces Backlash Over Plans To Let Children Access Metaverse</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Of all the VR developers that were offered jobs at Meta&nbsp;over the last nine months, the average compensation&nbsp;was nearly $540,000. For comparison, <strong>Apple Inc&#39;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ">AAPL</a>)&nbsp;highest pay packages for VR developers were a little below $500,000 and <strong>Alphabet Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ">GOOG</a>) reportedly paid its top-tier developers approximately $440,000.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Meta is trying to beat the competition by hiring the best talent, but competition continues to increase. <strong>Sony Group Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SONY#NYSE">SONY</a>) just released its <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/23/03/31571990/should-apple-worry-sonys-vr-headset-off-to-a-slow-start">PlayStation VR2 </a>in February, and Apple&#39;s long-awaited VR headset is expected to be <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/11/29631315/apple-may-start-production-of-its-arvr-headset-sooner-than-you-think">unveiled this year</a>.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>One executive from a smaller gaming company&nbsp;said he was unable to hire a senior developer last year because Meta had offered the candidate $800,000 per year with a performance bonus that could see&nbsp;total compensation rise to about $1 million.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;This candidate was a senior [developer who didn&rsquo;t have] super unique experience [or] skills.&nbsp;Facebook was doing pretty wild stuff a year ago,&quot;&nbsp;the executive reportedly said.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>META Price Action: </strong>Meta shares were down 1.23% at $218.77 at the time of writing, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://benzinga.grsm.io/gxjhpowx7zks">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo:&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/users/brianpenny-29844978/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=7499159">Brian Penny</a>&nbsp;from Pixabay.</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
