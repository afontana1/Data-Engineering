ByteDance increased shipments of its Pico headsets by 110%, IDC estimated.&nbsp;</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>ByteDance shipped 290,000 headsets in the year&#39;s final quarter, just shy of Meta&#39;s 310,000. In March, Meta reduced the price of one of the Quest 2 headsets by $70.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>To compete with Meta, ByteDance recognized the need for significant resources and subsidized manufacturing costs, according to Lazius Kaye, a former Pico employee. ByteDance&#39;s Pico 4 headset, available in Europe and Asia, retails for about $470. The Quest 2 headset with the same storage costs $400.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>ByteDance also trailed behind Meta with fewer game titles, inferior hand-tracking technology, and a less developed overall ecosystem, as per Kaye.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>Kevin Puryer, director of Sandford Tech, which develops the VR puzzle game &quot;Color Connect,&quot; launched &quot;Color Connect&quot; for ByteDance&#39;s Pico device in December, and in just over one month, it saw more paid downloads on Pico than the entire time it has been on Meta&#39;s App Lab.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><strong>Price Action:</strong>&nbsp;META shares traded higher by 2.18% at $218.68 on the last check Thursday.</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li><em>Photo via Wikimedia Commons</em></li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br> <p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
