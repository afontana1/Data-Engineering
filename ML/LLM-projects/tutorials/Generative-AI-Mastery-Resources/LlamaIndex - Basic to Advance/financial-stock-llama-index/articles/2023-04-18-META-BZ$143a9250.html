Zuckerberg was paid $10 million related to the security of his family and another&nbsp;$14.82 million for personal security at his residences, which was actually down from $15.2 million the year before. However, that number was more than offset by compensation for costs related to personal use of his jet.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>His compensation package included a $653,215 bump related to costs for personal private aircraft use. This category increased from $1.63 million in 2021 to $2.28 million in 2022.&nbsp;</strong></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;Mark Zuckerberg uses private aircraft for travel in connection with his overall security program ...&nbsp;that is indirectly and wholly owned by Mr. Zuckerberg and operated by an independent charter company for business and personal travel by Mr. Zuckerberg,&quot; the statement read.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>See Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31812589/exclusive-instead-of-job-security-or-housing-this-is-the-biggest-concern-among-americans">EXCLUSIVE: Instead Of Job Security Or Housing, This Is The Biggest Concern Among Americans</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Zuckerberg has named 2023 the<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/02/30691982/the-year-of-the-efficient-rabbit-why-analysts-are-raising-their-price-targets-on-me"> &quot;year of efficiency&quot;</a> for Meta.
