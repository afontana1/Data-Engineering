<p>Taking risks is an essential part of any business venture. Entrepreneurs and business leaders are no strangers to the risks and uncertainties that come with building something from scratch.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>According to <strong>Epic Games CEO</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Tim Sweeney</strong>&nbsp;there are two types of risks in business, and one is even more significant than the other.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;There are two types of risks in business. Everyone focuses on the risk of losing what they&#39;ve built, because it&#39;s so apparent,&quot; he tweeted on April, 21.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>See Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/23/03/31480768/epic-games-adapts-its-unreal-editor-for-fortnite">Epic Games Adapts Its Unreal Editor For &#39;Fortnite&#39;</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Sweeney added: &quot;But there&#39;s an even bigger risk: the risk of not building what you&#39;re capable of building.

He founded Epic Games in 1991 as <strong>Potomac Computer Systems</strong>&nbsp;and his company has&nbsp;become a household name in the video game industry. Epic Games is responsible for some of the most popular and successful video games of all time, including <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/12/30047324/no-eating-no-sleeping-is-a-hit-video-game-too-addictive-for-children-class-action-lawsuit-m">Fortnite</a>&nbsp;and Gears of War.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>The company also has its own publishing wing, <strong>Epic Games Publishing</strong>, under which it has published titles from other developers, such as Fall Guys&nbsp;and Rocket League Sideswipe.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Epic&#39;s early success came with the game ZZT,&nbsp;which was released in 1991 and became a cult classic. In 1998, Epic released Unreal, a first-person shooter game that became a huge success and spawned a franchise.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>But it was Epic&#39;s Unreal Engine that became the company&#39;s most significant achievement, providing a platform for creating some of the most popular video games in the world.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Sweeney, who wrote his first computer program at the age of 10 and has been programming ever since, has challenged <strong>Apple Inc&nbsp;</strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ">AAPL</a>)&nbsp;in the past.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>In a recent interview with Games Industry Biz, Sweeney <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/23/03/31480768/epic-games-adapts-its-unreal-editor-for-fortnite">shared his perspective on the metaverse</a> and Epic&#39;s plans to create a &quot;unified&quot; ecosystem that avoids becoming &quot;another walled garden&quot; versus Apple, which operates a closed system through the App Store on iPhone and iPad.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;They&rsquo;ll either try to crush the metaverse, or extract all the profit from it. One or the other. Apple doesn&rsquo;t let you use a competing browser engine. So they can do the same thing with the metaverse, so [they] can say, &lsquo;You must use Apple&rsquo;s limited metaverse engine, you can&rsquo;t build your own, you can&rsquo;t use Unreal.&rsquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>&quot;They could just amend all the platform&rsquo;s rules tomorrow to kill everything everybody is doing, and that&rsquo;s why we need really robust antitrust [laws]. And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re fighting this so hard,&quot; the CEO stated.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31709828/elon-musk-bill-gates-gave-their-takes-on-ai-bans-now-epic-games-founder-has-this-to-say">Elon Musk, Bill Gates Gave Their Takes On AI Bans, Now Epic Games Founder Has This To Say</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo: Official GDC via <a href="http://Official GDC, CC BY 2.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons">WikiCommons</a></em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
