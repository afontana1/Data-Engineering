<p><strong>Apple, Inc.&rsquo;s </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ">AAPL</a>) <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/31624090/apple-fans-mark-your-calendar-for-june-5-as-the-company-preps-for-the-beginning-of-a-post-iphone-era">Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is less than two months away</a>, with excitement brewing.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>In his latest &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman reiterated&nbsp;his view that the 2023 WWDC is an &ldquo;opportunity to herald a post-iPhone era while making its existing devices more attractive.&rdquo;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>Expected Unveils: </strong>Apple&#39;s much anticipated&nbsp;mixed-reality headset will be the star of the show, Gurman said. The columnist expects a showcase of other products, including new Macbooks&nbsp;and an update to the Apple Watch&rsquo;s software. A full list of the products he&#39;s especially enthusiastic about&nbsp;includes:&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><ul>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The mixed-reality headset</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>A new xrOS operating system and software kit</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>New MacBooks</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>IOS 17</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>IPadOS 17</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>MacOS 1</li>&#13;<br>&#9;<li>The WatchOS 10 update</li>&#13;<br></ul>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Several new models, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, an updated 13-inch MacBook Air, an entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, refreshed 24-inch in-house chips and an updated high-end MacBook Pro, are currently in the works, Gurman said. The new MacBook Pro models are expected to&nbsp;go on sale either this year or in early 2024, he added.&nbsp;There are also reportedly two Mac Studio follow-ups planned, but their timing is less clear.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Several of the&nbsp;new laptops will be announced at WWDC, the columnist said.&nbsp;The&nbsp;models rolling out&nbsp;in June, however, may not be powered by the new M3 chips but rather by&nbsp;something more in line with the current M2 processors, he noted.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apple-stock">Everything You Need To Know About Apple Stock</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Gurman said the updated iOS and iPadOS might&nbsp;also not offer&nbsp;new major features. Changes to the MacOS and TVOS are unlikely as well.&nbsp;</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Still, the columnist expects the new Apple Watch OS to incorporate notable adjustments,&nbsp;including an updated interface.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><strong>A Future Beyond iPhone and iPad: </strong> With the new mixed-reality headset, Apple is preparing for a future beyond the iPhone and iPad, Gurman said. The device will likely come with a clear story for developers and much of the conference will showcase the headset&rsquo;s on-board App Store and accompanying tools, he added.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Apple executives believe the headset will have a slow start but&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;replace the iPhone, Gurman said. The headset&nbsp;is unlikely to go on sale for several months after its unveiling, giving developers time to create mixed-reality apps and services, he explained.&nbsp;The columnist said he expects Apple will likely get the product out just in time for the holidays.</p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p>Apple closed Friday&#39;s session down 0.21% to $165.21, according to<a href="https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174"> Benzinga Pro data.</a></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31210278/apple-in-final-stages-of-production-testing-new-imacs-says-gurman-what-investors-should-know">Apple In Final Stages Of Production Testing New iMacs, Says Gurman: What Investors Should Know</a></em></p>&#13;<br>&#13;<br><p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>&#13;<br><p>Copyright &#169; Benzinga.
