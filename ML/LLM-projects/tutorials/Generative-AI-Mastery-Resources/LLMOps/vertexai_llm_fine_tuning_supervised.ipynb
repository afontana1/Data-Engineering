US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.\\n\\nForecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \\\"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\\\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.\\n\\nA dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \\\"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\\\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report. \\\"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\\\" China's booming economy and a \\\"spectacular comeback\\\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \\\"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\\\" it added. However, the report warned: \\\"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\\\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone's over-reliance on export-led growth.\\n\",\n          \"EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UK's public spending watchdog has said.\\n\\nThe National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud. It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts. The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. It said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. The report said: \\\"Member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the European Anti-Fraud Office on a consistent basis.\\n\\n\\\"As the court has now qualified its opinion on the Community accounts for a decade, it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of EU revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of EU resources.\\\" It said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth \\u00a338.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth \\u00a335.7m in 2002. At the same time, reported fraud throughout the EU dropped from 10,276 cases worth \\u00a3808m to 8,177 cases worth \\u00a3644m. Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency.\\n\\n\\\"Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community,\\\" he said. \\\"Departments responsible for administering EU funds need to make sure that they're doing everything possible to weed out improper spending. \\\"The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management.\\\" A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting. \\\"The quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state, and there is room for improvement,\\\" spokesman Jorg Wojahn said. He added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by NAO providing a \\\"good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud\\\".\\n\",\n          \"Labour's choice of a white candidate for one of the UK's most multi-racial seats proves the need for all-black short lists, says a race group.\\n\\nLocal councillor Lyn Brown was selected for West Ham, east London, in a contest between two white and five ethnic minority women. An Operation Black Vote spokesman said they now wanted to meet Labour party chairman Ian McCartney for discussions. Mr McCartney recently announced party consultation on all-black shortlists. However, Labour has so far unable been unable to comment on the implications of the West Ham result.\\n\\nAshok Vishwanathan of Operation Black Vote, which aims to increase ethnic minorities' participation in the political process and their representation, said the result again showed all-women shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected. \\\"I think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates,\\\" Mr Vishwanathan said.\\n\\nLast month the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) also called for ethnic minority shortlists in certain circumstances. A CRE spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. \\\"We will be raising it with each of the party leaders on a formal basis and helping them find the most appropriate way forward,\\\" the spokesman said. Ethnic minorities make up 8% of the United Kingdom population but only 2% of MPs - 13 out of 659 - are from a visible minority group. Twelve of them represent Labour, and one is a Liberal Democrat. If ethnic minorities were represented in the House of Commons in proportion to their numbers in the population, there would be 42 ethnic minority MPs.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 730,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Abortion not a poll issue - Blair\",\n          \"Robinson out of Six Nations\",\n          \"US data sparks inflation worries\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
