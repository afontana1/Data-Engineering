Dear learner, 

 

Today we’re launching a new short course, Improving Accuracy of LLM Applications, made in collaboration with Lamini and Meta and taught by Lamini’s CEO and co-founder Sharon Zhou, and Meta’s Senior Director of Partner Engineering, Amit Sangani.

 

Developers often face challenges with inconsistent outcomes when working with LLM applications. This course provides a structured approach to improve the accuracy and reliability of your LLM solutions.

 

Using Llama’s family of open-source models, you'll build an SQL agent, integrate performance evaluation metrics, and apply prompt engineering and self-reflection to enhance model behavior. Finally, you will fine-tune the model with techniques like LoRA and memory tuning that embeds facts in model weights to reduce hallucinations.

In detail, you will:

  -  Build a text to SQL agent and simulate situations where it hallucinates to begin the evaluation process.
  -  Build an evaluation framework to systematically measure performance, including criteria for good evaluations, best practices, and how to develop an evaluation score.
  -  Learn how instruction fine-tuning enhances pre-trained LLMs to follow instructions, and how memory fine-tuning embeds facts to reduce hallucinations. 
  -  Break fine-tuning myths and see how Performance-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce training time by 100x and Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) reduces it even further. 
  -  Go through an iterative process of generating training data and fine-tuning, learning practical tips such as adding examples, generating variations, and filtering generated data to increase model accuracy.

## Details
- Understand development steps, from evaluation, through prompting, self-reflection, and fine-tuning, to improve your model’s reliability and accuracy.

- Learn how memory tuning can increase your model performance by embedding facts into your model to reduce hallucination.

- Use the Llama 3-8b model to build an LLM application that converts text to SQL with a custom schema.
