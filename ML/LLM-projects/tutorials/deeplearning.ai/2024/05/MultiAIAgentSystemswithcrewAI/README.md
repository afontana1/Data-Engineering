Dear learner, 

 

Announcing a new short course on agents built in collaboration with crewAI! 

 

Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI is taught by Jo√£o Moura, founder and CEO of crewAI, and it will teach you key principles of designing effective AI agents and how to organize a team of agents to perform complex, multi-step tasks. 

 

Explore key components of multi-agent systems: 

- Role-playing: Assign specialized roles to agents 
- Memory: Provide agents with short-term, long-term, and shared memory
- Tools: Assign pre-built and custom tools to each agent (e.g. for web search)
- Focus: Break down the tasks, goals, and tools and assign multiple AI agents for better performance
- Guardrails: Effectively handle errors, hallucinations, and infinite loops
- Cooperation: Perform tasks in series, in parallel, and hierarchically

Work with crewAI, an open source library designed for building multi-agent systems, and get hands-on by building agent crews that execute common business processes, such as:

- Tailor resumes and interview prep for job applications
- Research, write and edit technical articles
- Automate customer support inquiries
- Conduct customer outreach campaigns
- Plan and execute events
- Perform financial analysis

If you've taken some prompt engineering courses and want to incorporate LLMs in your professional work, then this course is designed for you.

 

Start automating business workflows with multi-AI agent systems!

## Details
- Exceed the performance of prompting a single LLM by designing and prompting a team of AI agents through natural language.

- Use an open source library, crewAI, to automate repeatable, multi-step tasks like tailoring a resume to a job description; and automate business processes that are typically done by a group of people, like event planning.

- By creating a team of AI agents, you can define a specific role, goal, and backstory for each agent, which breaks down complex multi-step tasks and assigns them to agents that are customized to perform those tasks.
