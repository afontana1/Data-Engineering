React Hooks, such as <code>useState</code> for state management and <code>useEffect</code> for side effects, have provided a more streamlined and concise way to build and manage React applications. This shift has led to improved code readability and reusability, encouraging developers to migrate from class components to functional components. This trend aligns with the broader industry movement towards functional programming and modular design. As React continues to evolve, it's essential for developers to consider the benefits of functional components and React Hooks when building new applications or refactoring existing ones.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chourasia |first=Rawnak |date=2023-03-08 |title=Convert Class Component to Function(Arrow) Component - React |url=https://codeparttime.com/convert-class-to-function-arrow-react/ |access-date=2023-08-15 |website=Code Part Time}}</ref>\r\n\r\n=== Routing ===\r\nReact itself does not come with built-in support for [[routing]].
