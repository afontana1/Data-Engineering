React can be used to develop [[single-page application|single-page]], mobile, or [[Server-side rendering|server-rendered]] applications with frameworks like [[Next.js]]. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the [[Document Object Model|DOM]], React applications often rely on [[JavaScript libraries|libraries]] for routing and other client-side functionality.{{sfn|Dere|2017}}{{sfn|Panchal|2022}} A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.

==Basic usage==
The following is a rudimentary example of using React for the web, written in [[#JSX|JSX]] and JavaScript.

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

/** A pure component that displays a message */
const Greeting = () => {
  return (
    <div className="hello-world">
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

/** The main app component */
const App = () => {
  return <Greeting />;
};

/** React is rendered to a root element in the HTML page */
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
</syntaxhighlight>

based on the [[HTML]] document below.

<syntaxhighlight lang="html">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>React App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
</syntaxhighlight>

The <code>Greeting</code> function is a React component that displays [["Hello, World!" program|<nowiki>''</nowiki>Hello, world"]].

When displayed on a [[web browser]], the result will be a rendering of:
<syntaxhighlight lang="html">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>React App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
  <div id="root">
    <div class="hello-world">
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
</syntaxhighlight>

==Notable features==
===Declarative===
React adheres to the [[declarative programming]] [[Programming paradigm|paradigm]].{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|76}} Developers design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders components when data changes. This is in contrast with [[imperative programming]].{{sfn|Schwarzmüller|2018}}
===Components===
React code is made of entities called [[Component-based software engineering|components]].{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|10-12}} These components are modular and reusable.{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|70}} React applications typically consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the [[Document Object Model|DOM]] using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, values are passed between components through ''props'' (short for "properties")''.'' Values internal to a component are called its ''state.''<ref>{{cite web |title=Components and Props |url=https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#props-are-read-only |url-status=live |access-date=7 April 2018 |website=React |publisher=Facebook |archive-date=7 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407120115/https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html}}</ref>

The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class components.{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|118}}{{sfn|Larsen|2021}}{{rp|10}}

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
import React from "react";

/** A pure component that displays a message with the current count */
const CountDisplay = props => {
  // The count value is passed to this component as props
  const { count } = props;
  return (<div>The current count is {count}.</div>);
}

/** A component that displays a message that updates each time the button is clicked */
const Counter = () => {
  // The React useState Hook is used here to store and update the 
  // total number of times the button has been clicked.
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); 
  return (
    <div className="counter">
      <CountDisplay count={count} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Add one!</button>
    </div>
  );
};
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Function components ===
Function components are declared with a function (using JavaScript function syntax or an [[Anonymous function|arrow function expression]]) that accepts a single "props" argument and returns JSX. From React v16.8 onwards, function components can use state with the <code>useState</code> Hook.

<syntaxhighlight lang="js">
// Function syntax
function Greeter() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}

// Arrow function expression
const Greeter = () => <div>Hello World</div>;
</syntaxhighlight>

=== React Hooks ===
On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public, introducing React Hooks.<ref>{{cite web
|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
|title=Introducing Hooks
|publisher=react.js
|access-date=2019-05-20
}}</ref> Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html|title=Hooks at a Glance – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> Notably, Hooks do not work inside classes — they let developers use more features of React without classes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.soshace.com/what-the-heck-is-react-hooks/|title=What the Heck is React Hooks?|date=2020-01-16|website=Soshace|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>

React provides several built-in Hooks such as <code>useState</code>,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html|title=Using the State Hook – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>{{sfn|Larsen|2021}}{{rp|37}} <code>useContext</code>,{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|11}}<ref name=Larsen>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html|title=Using the State Hook – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>{{sfn|Larsen|2021}}{{rp|12}} <code>useReducer</code>,{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|92}}<ref name=Larsen>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html|title=Using the State Hook – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>{{sfn|Larsen|2021}}{{rp|65-66}} <code>useMemo</code>{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|154}}<ref name=Larsen>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html|title=Using the State Hook – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>{{sfn|Larsen|2021}}{{rp|162}} and <code>useEffect</code>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html|title=Using the Effect Hook – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>{{sfn|Larsen|2021}}{{rp|93-95}} Others are documented in the Hooks API Reference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html|title=Hooks API Reference – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|62}} <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>, which are the most commonly used, are for controlling state{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|37}} and side effects{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|61}} respectively.

==== Rules of hooks ====
There are two rules of Hooks<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html|title=Rules of Hooks – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> which describe the characteristic code patterns that Hooks rely on:

# "Only Call Hooks at the Top Level" — Don't call hooks from inside loops, conditions, or nested statements so that the hooks are called in the same order each render.
# "Only Call Hooks from React Functions" — Don't call hooks from plain JavaScript functions so that stateful logic stays with the component.

Although these rules can't be enforced at runtime, code analysis tools such as [[Lint (software)|linters]] can be configured to detect many mistakes during development. The rules apply to both usage of Hooks and the implementation of custom Hooks,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html|title=Building Your Own Hooks – React|website=reactjs.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> which may call other Hooks.

=== Server components ===
React server components or "RSC"s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components|title=React Labs: What We've Been Working On – March 2023|website=react.dev|language=en|access-date=2023-07-23}}</ref> are function components that run exclusively on the server.  The concept was first introduced in the talk [https://react.dev/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components Data Fetching with Server Components] Though a similar concept to Server Side Rendering, RSCs do not send corresponding JavaScript to the client as no hydration occurs.  As a result, they have no access to hooks. However, they may be [[Async/await| asynchronous function]], allowing them to directly perform asynchronous operations:

<syntaxhighlight lang="js" line="1">
async function MyComponent() {
  const message = await fetchMessageFromDb();

  return (
    <div>Message: {message}</div>
  );
}
</syntaxhighlight>

Currently, server components are most readily usable with [https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials Next.js]. 

=== Class components ===
Class components are declared using [[ECMAScript|ES6]] classes. They behave the same way that function components do, but instead of using Hooks to manage state and lifecycle events, they use the lifecycle methods on the <code>React.Component</code> [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|base class]].
<syntaxhighlight lang="js" line="1">
class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  state = { color: 'green' };
  render() {
    return (
      <ChildComponent color={this.state.color} />
    );
  }
}
</syntaxhighlight>The introduction of React Hooks with React 16.8 in February 2019 allowed developers to manage state and lifecycle behaviors within functional components, reducing the reliance on class components.

React Hooks, such as <code>useState</code> for state management and <code>useEffect</code> for side effects, have provided a more streamlined and concise way to build and manage React applications. This shift has led to improved code readability and reusability, encouraging developers to migrate from class components to functional components.

This trend aligns with the broader industry movement towards functional programming and modular design. As React continues to evolve, it's essential for developers to consider the benefits of functional components and React Hooks when building new applications or refactoring existing ones.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chourasia |first=Rawnak |date=2023-03-08 |title=Convert Class Component to Function(Arrow) Component - React |url=https://codeparttime.com/convert-class-to-function-arrow-react/ |access-date=2023-08-15 |website=Code Part Time}}</ref>

=== Routing ===
React itself does not come with built-in support for [[routing]]. React is primarily a library for building user interfaces, and it doesn't include a full-fledged routing solution out of the box.

However, there are popular third-party libraries that can be used to handle routing in React applications. One such library is <code>react-router</code>, which provides a comprehensive routing solution for React applications.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-07-12 |title=Mastering React Router - The Ultimate Guide |url=https://www.devban.com/react-router-ultimate-guide/ |access-date=2023-07-26 |language=en-US}}</ref> It allows you to define routes, manage navigation, and handle URL changes in a React-friendly way.

To use <code>react-router</code>, you need to install it as a separate package and integrate it into your React application.

# Install <code>react-router-dom</code> using npm or yarn:<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
npm install react-router-dom
</syntaxhighlight>
# Set up your routing configuration in your main application file:<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';
import Contact from './components/Contact';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
</syntaxhighlight>
# Create the components for each route (e.g., Home, About, Contact).

With this setup, when the user navigates to different URLs, the corresponding components will be rendered based on the defined routes.[[File:VirtualDOM with respect to realDOM.png|thumb|There is a Virtual DOM that is used to implement the real DOM]]

===Virtual DOM===
Another notable feature is the use of a virtual [[Document Object Model]], or [[Virtual DOM]]. React creates an [[In-memory processing|in-memory]] data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.<ref name="workingwiththebrowser">{{cite web |title=Refs and the DOM |url=https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html |access-date=2021-07-19 |website=React Blog}}</ref> This process is called '''reconciliation'''. This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while React only renders the components that actually change. This selective rendering provides a major performance boost.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=React: The Virtual DOM |url=https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-virtual-dom |access-date=2021-10-14 |website=Codecademy |language=en}}</ref>

== Updates ==
When <code>ReactDOM.render</code><ref>{{Cite web |title=ReactDOM – React |url=https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html |access-date=2023-01-08 |website=reactjs.org |language=en}}</ref> is called again for the same component and target, React represents the new UI state in the Virtual DOM and determines which parts (if any) of the living DOM needs to change.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Reconciliation – React |url=https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html |access-date=2023-01-08 |website=reactjs.org |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:React-example-virtual-dom-diff.svg|alt=Updates to realDOM are subject to virtualDOM|thumb|The virtualDOM will update the realDOM in real-time effortlessly]]

=== Lifecycle methods ===
Lifecycle methods for class-based components use a form of [[hooking]] that allows the execution of code at set points during a component's lifetime.

* <code>ShouldComponentUpdate</code> allows the developer to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of a component by returning false if a render is not required.
* <code>componentDidMount</code> is called once the component has "mounted" (the component has been created in the user interface, often by associating it with a [[Document Object Model|DOM]] node). This is commonly used to trigger data loading from a remote source via an [[API]].
*<code>componentWillUnmount</code> is called immediately before the component is torn down or "unmounted". This is commonly used to clear resource-demanding dependencies to the component that will not simply be removed with the unmounting of the component (e.g., removing any <code>setInterval()</code> instances that are related to the component, or an "[[Event (computing)|eventListener]]" set on the "document" because of the presence of the component)
* <code>render</code> is the most important lifecycle method and the only required one in any component. It is usually called every time the component's state is updated, which should be reflected in the user interface.

===JSX===
{{Main|JSX (JavaScript)|l1=JSX}}
[[JSX (JavaScript)|JSX]], or JavaScript Syntax Extension, is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax.<ref>{{cite web |date=2022-03-08 |title=Draft: JSX Specification |url=https://facebook.github.io/jsx/ |access-date=7 April 2018 |website=JSX |publisher=Facebook |language=en-US}}</ref> Similar in appearance to HTML,{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|11}} JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar{{sfn|Wieruch|2020}}{{rp|15}} to many developers. React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for [[PHP]] called [[XHP]].

An example of JSX code:
<syntaxhighlight lang="dart">
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Header</p>
        <p>Content</p>
        <p>Footer</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

===Architecture beyond HTML===
The basic [[Software architecture|architecture]] of React applies beyond rendering HTML in the browser. For example, Facebook has dynamic charts that render to <code><nowiki><canvas></nowiki></code> tags,<ref>{{cite web |last=Hunt |first=Pete |date=2013-06-05 |title=Why did we build React? – React Blog |url=https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html |access-date=2022-02-17 |website=reactjs.org |language=en-US}}</ref> and Netflix and [[PayPal]] use universal loading to render identical HTML on both the server and client.<ref name="paypal-isomorphic-reactjs">{{cite web |date=2015-04-27 |title=PayPal Isomorphic React |url=https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/isomorphic-react-apps-with-react-engine-17dae662379c |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208124143/https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2015/04/27/isomorphic-react-apps-with-react-engine/ |archive-date=2019-02-08 |access-date=2019-02-08 |website=medium.com}}</ref><ref name="netflix-isomorphic-reactjs">{{cite web |date=2015-01-28 |title=Netflix Isomorphic React |url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/01/netflix-likes-react.html |access-date=2022-02-14 |website=netflixtechblog.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Server-side Rendering ===
[[Server-side scripting|Server-side rendering]] (SSR) refers to the process of rendering a client-side JavaScript application on the server, rather than in the browser. This can improve the performance of the application, especially for users on slower connections or devices.

With SSR, the initial HTML that is sent to the client includes the fully rendered UI of the application. This allows the client's browser to display the UI immediately, rather than having to wait for the JavaScript to download and execute before rendering the UI.

React supports SSR, which allows developers to render React components on the server and send the resulting HTML to the client. This can be useful for improving the performance of the application, as well as for [[search engine optimization]] purposes.<syntaxhighlight lang="js" line="1">
const express = require('express');
const React = require('react');
const { renderToString } = require('react-dom/server');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const html = renderToString(<MyApp />);
  res.send(`
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <body>
        <div id="root">${html}</div>
        <script src="/bundle.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});

</syntaxhighlight>

==Common idioms==
React does not attempt to provide a complete application library. It is designed specifically for building user interfaces<ref name="react" /> and therefore does not include many of the tools some developers might consider necessary to build an application. This allows the choice of whichever libraries the developer prefers to accomplish tasks such as performing network access or local data storage. Common patterns of usage have emerged as the library matures.

===Unidirectional data flow===
To support React's concept of unidirectional data flow (which might be contrasted with [[AngularJS]]'s bidirectional flow), the Flux architecture was developed as an alternative to the popular [[model–view–controller]] architecture. Flux features ''actions'' which are sent through a central ''dispatcher'' to a ''store'', and changes to the store are propagated back to the view.<ref name="flux">{{cite web|url=https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview|title=In Depth OverView|publisher=Facebook|access-date=7 April 2018|website=Flux}}</ref> When used with React, this propagation is accomplished through component properties. Since its conception, Flux has been superseded by libraries such as [[Redux (JavaScript library)|Redux]] and MobX.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flux Release 4.0|url=https://github.com/facebook/flux/releases/tag/4.0.0|website=Github|access-date=26 February 2021}}</ref>

Flux can be considered a variant of the [[observer pattern]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Nicholas|title=Introduction to Flux - React Exercise|url=http://nicholasjohnson.com/react/course/exercises/flux/|website=Nicholas Johnson|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref>

A React component under the Flux architecture should not directly modify any props passed to it, but should be passed [[callback function]]s that create ''actions'' which are sent by the dispatcher to modify the store. The action is an object whose responsibility is to describe what has taken place: for example, an action describing one user "following" another might contain a user id, a target user id, and the type <code>USER_FOLLOWED_ANOTHER_USER</code>.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abramov|first1=Dan|title=The History of React and Flux with Dan Abramov|url=http://threedevsandamaybe.com/the-history-of-react-and-flux-with-dan-abramov/|website=Three Devs and a Maybe|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The stores, which can be thought of as models, can alter themselves in response to actions received from the dispatcher.

This pattern is sometimes expressed as "properties flow down, actions flow up". Many implementations of Flux have been created since its inception, perhaps the most well-known being [[Redux (JavaScript library)|Redux]], which features a single store, often called a [[single source of truth]].<ref>{{cite web|title=State Management Tools - Results|url=http://2016.stateofjs.com/2016/statemanagement/|website=The State of JavaScript|access-date=29 October 2021}}</ref>

In February 2019, <code>useReducer</code> was introduced as a [[React (web framework)#React Hooks|React hook]] in the 16.8 release. It provides an API that is consistent with Redux, enabling developers to create Redux-like stores that are local to component states.<ref>[https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html#react-1 React v16.8: The One with Hooks]</ref>

==Future development==
Project status can be tracked via the core team discussion forum.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Meeting Notes|url = https://discuss.reactjs.org/c/meeting-notes|website = React Discuss|access-date = 2015-12-13}}</ref> However, major changes to React go through the Future of React repository issues and [[pull request]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title = reactjs/react-future - The Future of React|url = https://github.com/reactjs/react-future|website = GitHub|access-date = 2015-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = facebook/react - Feature request issues|url = https://github.com/facebook/react/labels/Type:%20Feature%20Request|website = GitHub|access-date = 2015-12-13}}</ref> This enables the React community to provide feedback on new potential features, experimental APIs and JavaScript syntax improvements.

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at [[Meta Platforms|Meta]], who initially developed a prototype called "F-Bolt" <ref name="How A Small Team of Developers Created React at Facebook | React.js: The Documentary">{{cite web |title=React.js: The Documentary |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44?si=FMJqegC4dPtwKP__&t=528 |website=Youtube |publisher=Honeypot}}</ref> before later renaming it to "FaxJS". This early version is documented in Jordan Walke's GitHub repository.{{ref|Walke, Jordan. "FaxJS." GitHub. https://github.com/jordwalke/FaxJs. Accessed 11 July 2019.}} Influences for the project included [[XHP]], an [[HTML]] component library for [[PHP]].

React was first deployed on Facebook's [[News Feed]] in 2011 and subsequently integrated into [[Instagram]] in 2012. However, a specific citation is needed to verify this claim. In May 2013, at JSConf US, the project was officially open-sourced, marking a significant turning point in its adoption and growth.{{ref|Hámori, Emergent. "React - The Pragmatic Guide." 2022.}}


[[React Native]], which enables native [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[Universal Windows Platform|UWP]] development with React, was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.

On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new set of internal algorithms for rendering, as opposed to React's old rendering algorithm, Stack.{{sfn|Lardinois|2017}} React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React library.<ref>{{cite web|title = React Fiber Architecture|url = https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture| website=Github|access-date = 19 April 2017}}</ref>{{Update inline|reason=Last commit was in 2016. Is this statement still true?|date=June 2018}} The actual syntax for programming with React does not change; only the way that the syntax is executed has changed.<ref name="techcrunch">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/facebook-announces-react-fiber-a-rewrite-of-its-react-framework/|title=Facebook announces React Fiber, a rewrite of its React framework|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=2018-10-19}}</ref> React's old rendering system, Stack, was developed at a time when the focus of the system on dynamic change was not understood. Stack was slow to draw complex animation, for example, trying to accomplish all of it in one chunk. Fiber breaks down animation into segments that can be spread out over multiple frames. Likewise, the structure of a page can be broken into segments that may be maintained and updated separately. JavaScript functions and virtual [[Document Object Model|DOM]] objects are called "fibers", and each can be operated and updated separately, allowing for smoother on-screen rendering.<ref name="github">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture|title=GitHub - acdlite/react-fiber-architecture: A description of React's new core algorithm, React Fiber|website=github.com|accessdate=2018-10-19}}</ref>

On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.<ref>{{cite web
|url=https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html
|title=React v16.0
|publisher=react.js
|date=2017-09-26
|access-date=2019-05-20
}}</ref>

On August 10, 2020, the React team announced the first release candidate for React v17.0, notable as the first major release without major changes to the React developer-facing API.<ref>url=https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html</ref>

On March 29, 2022, React 18 was released which introduced a new concurrent renderer, automatic batching and support for server side rendering with Suspense.<ref name=":1" />

==Licensing==
The initial public release of React in May 2013 used the [[Apache License 2.0]]. In October 2014, React 0.12.00 replaced this with the [[BSD licenses#3-clause|3-clause BSD license]] and added a separate PATENTS text file that permits usage of any Facebook patents related to the software:<ref>{{cite web|title=React CHANGELOG.md|url=https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0120-october-28-2014|website=GitHub}}</ref><blockquote>The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice, for anyone that makes any claim (including by filing any lawsuit, assertion or other action) alleging (a) direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent: (i) by Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether or not such claim is related to the Software, (ii) by any party if such claim arises in whole or in part from any software, product or service of Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether or not such claim is related to the Software, or (iii) by any party relating to the Software; or (b) that any right in any patent claim of Facebook is invalid or unenforceable.</blockquote>This unconventional clause caused some controversy and debate in the React user community, because it could be interpreted to empower Facebook to revoke the license in many scenarios, for example, if Facebook sues the licensee prompting them to take "other action" by publishing the action on a blog or elsewhere. Many expressed concerns that Facebook could unfairly exploit the termination clause or that integrating React into a product might complicate a startup company's future acquisition.<ref>{{cite web|title=A compelling reason not to use ReactJS|first=Austin|last=Liu|url=https://medium.com/bits-and-pixels/a-compelling-reason-not-to-use-reactjs-beac24402f7b|website=Medium}}</ref>

Based on community feedback, Facebook updated the patent grant in April 2015 to be less ambiguous and more permissive:<ref>{{cite web|title=Updating Our Open Source Patent Grant|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/1639473982937255/updating-our-open-source-patent-grant/}}</ref>

<blockquote>The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice, if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or in part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating to the Software. [...] A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action alleging direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including a cross-claim or counterclaim.<ref>{{cite web|title=Additional Grant of Patent Rights Version 2|url=https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b8ba8c83f318b84e42933f6928f231dc0918f864/PATENTS|website=GitHub}}</ref></blockquote>

The [[Apache Software Foundation]] considered this licensing arrangement to be incompatible with its licensing policies, as it "passes along risk to downstream consumers of our software imbalanced in favor of the licensor, not the licensee, thereby violating our Apache legal policy of being a universal donor", and "are not a subset of those found in the [Apache License 2.0], and they cannot be sublicensed as [Apache License 2.0]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html|title=ASF Legal Previously Asked Questions|publisher=Apache Software Foundation|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}</ref> In August 2017, Facebook dismissed the Apache Foundation's downstream concerns and refused to reconsider their license.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/|title=Explaining React's License|website=Facebook|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191#issuecomment-323486580|title=Consider re-licensing to AL v2.0, as RocksDB has just done|website=Github|language=en|access-date=2017-08-18}}</ref> The following month, [[WordPress]] decided to switch its Gutenberg and Calypso projects away from React.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/wordpress-to-ditch-react-library-over-facebook-patent-clause-risk/|title= WordPress to ditch React library over Facebook patent clause risk |website=TechCrunch|language=en|access-date=2017-09-16}}</ref>

On September 23, 2017, Facebook announced that the following week, it would re-license Flow, Jest, React, and Immutable.js under a standard [[MIT License]]; the company stated that React was "the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web", and that they did not want to "hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons".<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/|title= Relicensing React, Jest, Flow, and Immutable.js |website=Facebook Code|language=en|date=2017-09-23}}</ref>
