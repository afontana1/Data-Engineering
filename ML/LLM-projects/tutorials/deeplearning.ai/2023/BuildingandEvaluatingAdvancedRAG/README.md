https://learn.deeplearning.ai/building-evaluating-advanced-rag/

Learn how to efficiently bring Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into production by enhancing retrieval techniques and mastering evaluation metrics.

- Learn methods like sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval, improving your RAG pipeline’s performance beyond the baseline.
- Learn evaluation best practices to streamline your process, and iteratively build a robust system.
- Dive into the RAG triad for evaluating the relevance and truthfulness of an LLM’s response:Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance.
