# LangChain Chat with Your Data

https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain-chat-with-your-data

In this class, we've covered how to use LangChain to load data 
from a variety of document sources using LangChain's 80-plus 
different document loaders. 
From there, we split the documents into chunks, 
and talk about a lot of the nuances that arrive when doing so. 
After that, we take those chunks, create embeddings for them, 
and put them into a vector store, showing how that 
easily enables semantic search. 
But we also talk about some of the downsides of semantic search, 
and where it can fail in the certain edge cases that arise. 
The next thing that we cover is retrieval, 
maybe my favorite part of the class, where we talk about a lot of new 
and advanced and really fun retrieval algorithms for 
overcoming those edge cases. 
We combine that with LLMs in the next session, 
where we take those retrieved documents, 
we take the user question, we pass it to an LLM, 
and we generate an answer to the original question. 
But there's still one thing missing, which 
is the conversational aspect of it. 
And that's where we finish out the class, by 
creating a fully functioning end-to-end chatbot over your data.
