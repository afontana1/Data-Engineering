{"question": "### Question:\nDo I need to provide data as train and test split?\n\n### Answer:", "answer": "No, the LLM Engine internally uses technologies like dev sets to calibrate training.  However, as a best practice in machine learning, we recommend that you develop your own test set that you do not add to the LLM Engine, that allows you to evaluate the performance of the LLM you are building without overfitting.  A gold test set should typically include 10s to 100s of examples that are sufficiently representative of your use case and include high quality labels.  We also recommend using human evaluation to judge the performance of the language model on your test set, instead of metrics like BLEU."}

{"question": "### Question:\nCan you explain the mechanism behind the `cancel_job()` function? How does it handle the interruption of an ongoing training process?\n\n### Answer:", "answer": "The `cancel_job()` function is used to interrupt an ongoing training process. When called, it sends a request to the Llama server to cancel the job with the specified job ID. The server then stops the job and returns a response indicating whether the cancellation was successful or not. If the job was successfully canceled, any resources that were being used by the job are released. If the job was not successfully canceled, it will continue running until completion. It is important to note that canceling a job may result in the loss of any progress made during the training process."}
{"question": "### Question:\nHow does the `sample()` function generate text outputs?

{"question": "### Question:\nWhat is RLHF?\n\n### Answer:", "answer": "In machine learning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or reinforcement learning from human preferences is a technique that trains a \"reward model\" directly from human feedback and uses the model as a reward function to optimize an agent's policy using reinforcement learning (RL) through an optimization algorithm like Proximal Policy Optimization. The reward model is trained in advance to the policy being optimized to predict if a given output is good (high reward) or bad (low reward). RLHF can improve the robustness and exploration of RL agents, especially when the reward function is sparse or noisy.Human feedback is collected by asking humans to rank instances of the agent's behavior. These rankings can then be used to score outputs, for example with the Elo rating system."}
{"question": "### Question:\nDoes lamini support error analysis through a UI?\n\n### Answer:", "answer": "No, Lamini does not currently have a UI for error analysis, but it is easy to setup an error analysis process in a Lamini notebook. Error analysis is the process to isolate, observe and diagnose erroneous ML predictions thereby helping understand pockets of high and low performance of the model. When it is said that “the model accuracy is 90%” it might not be uniform across subgroups of data and there might be some input conditions which the model fails more. So, it is the next step from aggregate metrics to a more in-depth review of model errors for improvement."}

{"question": "### Question:\nHow do I convert my data from a pandas dataframe into a lamini type?\n\n### Answer:", "answer": "To convert a pandas DataFrame into a Lamini type, you can follow a straightforward process. First, load your pandas DataFrame into your Python environment. Next, define a Lamini type that corresponds to the columns in your DataFrame. This Lamini type will serve as a template for the data conversion. Iterate over the rows of your DataFrame, creating a Lamini object for each row. Assign the values from the DataFrame columns to the corresponding fields in the Lamini object. By performing this iterative process, you can effectively convert your data from a pandas DataFrame into the desired Lamini type."}
{"question": "### Question:\nDataFrame({ 'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'age': [25, 30, 35], 'city': \\n['New York', 'San Francisco', 'London'] })\\n\\n# Define Lamini type with matching fields\n\n### Answer:", "answer": "iterrows():\\n  person = PersonType( name=row['name'], age=row['age'], city=row['city'] )\\n  lamini_objects.append(person) \\n\\n“””\\nIn this example, a pandas DataFrame is created with columns for 'name', 'age', and 'city'. A Lamini type called 'PersonType' is defined with fields matching the DataFrame columns. The DataFrame rows are iterated over, and for each row, a Lamini object of 'PersonType' is created, with the values from the corresponding DataFrame columns assigned to the Lamini object's fields. Finally, the converted Lamini objects are accessed and printed."}
