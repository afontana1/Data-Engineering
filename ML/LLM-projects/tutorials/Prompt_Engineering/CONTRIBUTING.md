## Adding a New Prompt Engineering Technique

When adding a new prompt engineering technique to the repository, please follow these additional steps:

1. Create your notebook in the `all_prompt_engineering_techniques` folder.
2. Update the README.md file:
   - Add your new technique to the list of implementations in the README.
   - Place it in the appropriate category based on complexity and type.
   - Use the following format for the link:
     ```
     ### [Number]. [Your Technique Name üè∑Ô∏è](https://github.com/NirDiamant/Prompt_Engineering/blob/main/all_prompt_engineering_techniques/your_file_name.ipynb)
     ```
   - Replace `[Number]` with the appropriate number, `[Your Technique Name]` with your technique's name, and `your_file_name.ipynb` with the actual name of your notebook file.
   - Choose an appropriate emoji that represents your technique.
   - After inserting your new technique, make sure to update the numbers of all subsequent techniques to maintain the correct order.

For example:
```
1. [Intro-prompt-engineering-lesson üìù](hhttps://github.com/NirDiamant/Prompt_Engineering/blob/main/all_prompt_engineering_techniques/basic_prompt_construction.ipynb)
2. [Your New Technique üÜï](https://github.com/NirDiamant/Prompt_Engineering/blob/main/all_prompt_engineering_techniques/your_new_technique.ipynb)
3. [Next Technique üîú](https://github.com/NirDiamant/Prompt_Engineering/blob/main/all_prompt_engineering_techniques/next_technique.ipynb)
```

Remember to increment the numbers of all techniques that come after your newly inserted implementation.

## Notebook Structure

For new notebooks or significant additions to existing ones, please follow this structure:

1. **Title and Overview:** Clear title and brief overview of the prompt engineering technique.

2. **Detailed Explanation:** Cover motivation, key components, technique architecture, and conclusion.

3. **Implementation:** Step-by-step implementation with clear comments and explanations.

4. **Usage Example:** Demonstrate the technique with a practical example.

5. **Additional Considerations:** Discuss limitations, potential improvements, or specific use cases.

6. **References:** Include relevant citations or resources if you have.

## Notebook Best Practices

To ensure consistency and readability across all notebooks:

1. **Code Cell Descriptions:** Each code cell should be preceded by a markdown cell with a clear, concise title describing the cell's content or purpose.

2. **Consistent Formatting:** Maintain consistent formatting throughout the notebook, including regular use of markdown headers, code comments, and proper indentation.

## Code Quality and Readability

To ensure the highest quality and readability of our code:

1. **Write Clean Code:** Follow best practices for clean, readable code.
2. **Use Comments:** Add clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
3. **Format Your Code:** Use consistent formatting throughout your contribution.
4. **Language Model Review:** After completing your code, consider passing it through a language model for additional formatting and readability improvements. This extra step can help make your code even more accessible and maintainable.

## Documentation

Clear documentation is crucial. Whether you're improving existing docs or adding new ones, follow the same process: fork, change, test, and submit a pull request.

## Final Notes

We're grateful for all our contributors and excited to see how you'll help expand the world's most comprehensive prompt engineering resource. Don't hesitate to ask questions in our Discord community if you're unsure about anything.

Let's harness our collective knowledge and creativity to push the boundaries of prompt engineering technology together!
