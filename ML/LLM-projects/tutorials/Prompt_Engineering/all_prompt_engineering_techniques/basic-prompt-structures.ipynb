    "# Basic Prompt Structures Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on two fundamental types of prompt structures:\n",
    "1. Single-turn prompts\n",
    "2. Multi-turn prompts (conversations)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use OpenAI's GPT model and LangChain to demonstrate these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding different prompt structures is crucial for effective communication with AI models. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, straightforward queries, while multi-turn prompts enable more complex, context-aware interactions. Mastering these structures allows for more versatile and effective use of AI in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-turn Prompts**: One-shot interactions with the language model.\n",
    "2. **Multi-turn Prompts**: Series of interactions that maintain context.\n",
    "3. **Prompt Templates**: Reusable structures for consistent prompting.\n",
    "4. **Conversation Chains**: Maintaining context across multiple interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a combination of OpenAI's API and LangChain library to demonstrate these prompt structures. The tutorial will include practical examples and comparisons of different prompt types."
