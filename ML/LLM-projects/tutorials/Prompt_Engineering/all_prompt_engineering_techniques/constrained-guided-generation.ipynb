    "# Constrained and Guided Generation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores the concepts of constrained and guided generation in the context of large language models. We'll focus on techniques to set up constraints for model outputs and implement rule-based generation using OpenAI's GPT models and the LangChain library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "While large language models are powerful tools for generating text, they sometimes produce outputs that are too open-ended or lack specific desired characteristics. Constrained and guided generation techniques allow us to exert more control over the model's outputs, making them more suitable for specific tasks or adhering to certain rules and formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting up constraints for model outputs\n",
    "2. Implementing rule-based generation\n",
    "3. Using LangChain's PromptTemplate for structured prompts\n",
    "4. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT models for text generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a combination of prompt engineering techniques and LangChain's utilities to implement constrained and guided generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll start by setting up the environment and importing necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. We'll create structured prompts using LangChain's PromptTemplate to guide the model's output.\n",
    "3. We'll implement constraints by specifying rules and formats in our prompts.\n",
    "4. We'll use OpenAI's GPT model to generate text based on our constrained prompts.\n",
    "5. We'll explore different techniques for rule-based generation, including output parsing and regex-based validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to implement constrained and guided generation techniques. These skills will enable you to create more controlled and specific outputs from large language models, making them more suitable for a wide range of applications where precise and rule-adherent text generation is required."
