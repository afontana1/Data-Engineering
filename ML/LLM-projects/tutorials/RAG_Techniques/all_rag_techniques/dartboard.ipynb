    "# Dartboard RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Balanced Relevance and Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The **Dartboard RAG** process addresses a common challenge in large knowledge bases: ensuring the retrieved information is both relevant and non-redundant. By explicitly optimizing a combined relevance-diversity scoring function, it prevents multiple top-k documents from offering the same information. This approach is drawn from the elegant method in thepaper:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [*Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12101)\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper outlines three variations of the core idea—hybrid RAG (dense + sparse), a cross-encoder version, and a vanilla approach. The **vanilla approach** conveys the fundamental concept most directly, and this implementation extends it with optional weights to control the balance between relevance and diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dense, Overlapping Knowledge Bases**  \n",
    "   In large databases, documents may repeat similar content, causing redundancy in top-k retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Information Coverage**  \n",
    "   Combining relevance and diversity yields a richer set of documents, mitigating the “echo chamber” effect of overly similar content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevance & Diversity Combination**  \n",
    "   - Computes a score factoring in both how pertinent a document is to the query and how distinct it is from already chosen documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted Balancing**  \n",
    "   - Introduces RELEVANCE_WEIGHT and DIVERSITY_WEIGHT to allow dynamic control of scoring.  \n",
    "   - Helps in avoiding overly diverse but less relevant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Production-Ready Code**  \n",
    "   - Derived from the official implementation yet reorganized for clarity.  \n",
    "   - Allows easier integration into existing RAG pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Retrieval**  \n",
    "   - Obtain an initial set of candidate documents based on similarity (e.g., cosine or BM25).  \n",
    "   - Typically retrieves top-N candidates as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scoring & Selection**  \n",
    "   - Each document’s overall score combines **relevance** and **diversity**:  \n",
    "   - Select the highest-scoring document, then penalize documents that are overly similar to it.  \n",
    "   - Repeat until top-k documents are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid / Fusion & Cross-Encoder Support**  \n",
    "   Essentially, all you need are distances between documents and the query, and distances between documents. You can easily extract these from hybrid / fusion retrieval or from cross-encoder retrieval. The only recommendation I have is to rely less on raking based scores.\n",
    "   - For **hybrid / fusion retrieval**: Merge similarities (dense and sparse / BM25) into a single distance. This can be achieved by combining cosine similarity over the dense and the sparse vectors (e.g. averaging them). the move to distances is straightforward (1 - mean cosine similarity). \n",
    "   - For **cross-encoders**: You can directly use the cross-encoder similarity scores (1- similarity), potentially adjusting with scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Balancing & Adjustment**  \n",
    "   - Tune DIVERSITY_WEIGHT and RELEVANCE_WEIGHT based on your needs and the density of your dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating both **relevance** and **diversity** into retrieval, the Dartboard RAG approach ensures that top-k documents collectively offer richer, more comprehensive information—leading to higher-quality responses in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also has an official code implemention, and this code is based on it, but I think this one here is more readable, manageable and production ready."
