    "# Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings (HyPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system enhanced by Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings (HyPE). Unlike traditional RAG pipelines that struggle with query-document style mismatch, HyPE precomputes hypothetical questions during the indexing phase. This transforms retrieval into a question-question matching problem, eliminating the need for expensive runtime query expansion techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components of notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PDF processing and text extraction\n",
    "2. Text chunking to maintain coherent information units\n",
    "3. **Hypothetical Prompt Embedding Generation** using an LLM to create multiple proxy questions per chunk\n",
    "4. Vector store creation using [FAISS](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/) and OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "5. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents\n",
    "6. Evaluation of the RAG system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The PDF is loaded using `PyPDFLoader`.\n",
    "2. The text is split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with specified chunk size and overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothetical Question Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of embedding raw text chunks, HyPE **generates multiple hypothetical prompts** for each chunk. These **precomputed questions** simulate user queries, improving alignment with real-world searches. This removes the need for runtime synthetic answer generation needed in techniques like HyDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Store Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each hypothetical question is embedded using OpenAI embeddings.\n",
    "2. A FAISS vector store is built, associating **each question embedding with its original chunk**.\n",
    "3. This approach **stores multiple representations per chunk**, increasing retrieval flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retriever Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The retriever is optimized for **question-question matching** rather than direct document retrieval.\n",
    "2. The FAISS index enables **efficient nearest-neighbor** search over the hypothetical prompt embeddings.\n",
    "3. Retrieved chunks provide a **richer and more precise context** for downstream LLM generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precomputed Hypothetical Prompts** – Improves query alignment without runtime overhead.\n",
    "2. **Multi-Vector Representation**– Each chunk is indexed multiple times for broader semantic coverage.\n",
    "3. **Efficient Retrieval** – FAISS ensures fast similarity search over the enhanced embeddings.\n",
    "4. **Modular Design** – The pipeline is easy to adapt for different datasets and retrieval settings. Additionally it's compatible with most optimizations like reranking etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "HyPE's effectiveness is evaluated across multiple datasets, showing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Up to 42 percentage points improvement in retrieval precision\n",
    "- Up to 45 percentage points improvement in claim recall\n",
    "    (See full evaluation results in [preprint](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5139335))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eliminates Query-Time Overhead** – All hypothetical generation is done offline at indexing.\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Retrieval Precision** – Better alignment between queries and stored content.\n",
    "3. **Scalable & Efficient** – No addinal per-query computational cost; retrieval is as fast as standard RAG.\n",
    "4. **Flexible & Extensible** – Can be combined with advanced RAG techniques like reranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "HyPE provides a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional RAG systems, overcoming query-document style mismatch while avoiding the computational cost of runtime query expansion. By moving hypothetical prompt generation to indexing, it significantly enhances retrieval precision and efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.\n",
