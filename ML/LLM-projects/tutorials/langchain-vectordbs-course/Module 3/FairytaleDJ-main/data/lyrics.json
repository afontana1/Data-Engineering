True love brings out the best. . Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper. That's what it's all about. Father, sister, brother. We need each other. To raise us up and round us out. . Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper. But when push comes to shove. The only fixer upper fixer. That can fix a fixer upper is. True. True. True. True. Love. . "

Now I'd like to share the wisdom of my favorite bibliophile. . He said a cover is not the book. So open it up and take a look. 'Cause under the covers one discovers. That the king may be a crook. Chapter titles are like signs. And if you read between the lines. You'll find your first impression was mistook. For a cover is nice, but a cover is not the book. . (...spoken...). Mary Poppins, could you give us an example?. Certainly.. . Nellie Rubina was made of wood. But what could not be seen was. Though her trunk up top was barren. Well, her roots were lush and green. So in Spring when Mr. Hickory saw her blossoms bloomin' there. He took root, despite her bark. And now there's seedlings everywhere. . Which proves a cover is not the book. So open it up and take a look. 'Cause under the covers one discovers. That the king may be a crook. Chapter titles are like signs. And if you read between the lines. You'll find your first impression was mistook. For a cover is nice, but a cover is not the book. . (...spoken...). Should we do the one about the wealthy widow?. Oh, by all means.. I always loved that one. Well, go on then.. . Lady Hyacinth McCall brought all her treasures to a reef. Where she only wore a smile. Plus two feathers and a leaf. So no one tried to rob her 'cause she barely wore a stitch. For when you're in your birthday suit. There ain't much there to show you're rich. . Oh, a cover is not the book. So open it up and take a look. 'Cause under the covers one discovers. That the king may be a crook. Taroo-ra-li taroo-ra-la, taroo-ra-li tara-ta-ta. You'll find your first impression was mistook. Ya-da-da-da. For a cover is nice, but a cover is not the book. . (...spoken...). Oh, give us the one about the Dirty Rascal, why don't ya?. Isn't that one a bit long?. Well, the quicker you're into it, the quicker you're out of it.. . Once upon a time, in a nursery rhyme. There was a castle with a king hiding in a wing. 'Cause he never went to school to learn a single thing. He had sceptres and swords and a parliament of lords. But on the inside he was sad, egad!. Because he never had a wisdom for numbers, a wisdom for words. Though his crown was quite immense, his brain was smaller than a bird's. . So the queen of the nation made a royal proclamation. To the Misses and the Messrs, the More-or-Lessers, bring me all the land's professors. Then she went to the hairdresser's. And they came from the east and they came from the south. From each college they poured knowledge from their brains into his mouth. But the king couldn't learn, so each professor met their fate. For the queen had their heads removed and placed upon the gate. And on that date, I state their wives all got a note their mate was now the late great. . But then suddenly one day a stranger started in to sing. He said I'm the Dirty Rascal, and I'm here to teach the king. And the queen clutched her jewels, for she hated royal fools. But this fool had some rules they really ought to teach in schools. Like you'll be a happy king if you enjoy the things you've got. You should never try to be the kind of person that you're not. . So they sang and they laughed, for the king had found a friend. And they ran on to a rainbow for the story's perfect end. So the moral is you musn't let the outside be the guide. For it's not so cut and dried. Well, unless it's Dr. Jekyll, then you'd better hide, petrified. Now the truth can't be denied. As I know I've testified. All that really counts and matters is the special stuff inside. (He did it!). . Oh, a cover is not the book. So open it up and take a look. 'Cause under the covers one discovers. That the king may be a crook. So please listen to what we've said. And open a book tonight in bed. So one more time before we get the hook (sing it out strong!). A cover is nice. Please take our advice. A cover is nice. Or you'll pay the price. A cover is nice. But a cover is not the book!. Taroo-ra-li taroo-ra-la, taroo-ra-li taroo-ra-la, taroo-ra-li taroo-ra-la, la, la!. .
