The cold never bothered me anyway. . It's funny how some distance. Makes everything seem small. And the fears that once controlled me. Can't get to me at all. It's time to see what I can do. To test the limits and break through. No right, no wrong. No rules for me. I'm free!. . Let it go, let it go. I am one with the wind and sky. Let it go, let it go. You'll never see me cry. Here I stand and here I'll stay. Let the storm rage on. . My power flurries through the air into the ground. My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around. And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast. I'm never going back. The past is in the past. . Let it go, let it go. And I'll rise like the break of dawn. Let it go, let it go. That perfect girl is gone. Here I stand in the light of day. Let the storm rage on. The cold never bothered me anyway. . ",

And I could never survive a minute apart. You are my 1 true love, my 1 true love. My heaven above, my 1 true love. . Heavy rain on a Saturday. When you said my name in the saddest way. Nothing numbs the pain; you're still the light of my life. I drove by your house 10 thousand times last year. Nobody else wanted to dry my tears. Nobody else. Nobody else, nobody else. . 'Cause you've opened my eyes and stolen my heart. You make me believe that love can be art. And I could never survive a minute apart. You are my 1 true love, my 1 true love.
