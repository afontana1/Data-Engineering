What is the key metric for measuring success of a 2-week free trial?	Conversion to closed/won is pretty much the key metric  Are you guys being specific on the key success factors with your prospects?

Otherwise you may find that reps default to trials because they’re not confident about closing the deal, doesn’t have clear success criteria, then goes closed lost  During the trial period, highly suggest you measure usage and develop some intuition on what you typically see in deals that convert versus those that do not 	Conversion to won/closed is the key metric for measuring success of a 2-week free trial

What are the most crucial behaviors for someone looking to make a transition into a more proactive/strategic method of working? Please list bullet points for high level concepts	## Message: Hey all! A nice high-level question for you here. I am about 3 years into my RevOps career now, and I am really keen to start moving towards a more proactive/strategic method of working, as opposed to the more reactive/tactical way of which I find myself currently doing!  My questions are: • Those who have made this transition consciously already, what activities did you undertake to support this & what else helped you to do so?  • What do you think the most crucial behaviours are for someone looking to make this kind of transition? Thank you!  3 Replies: **Reply**: • *Research things related to RevOps roadmaps*. A whole RevOps function can never be 100% strategic, because we're a service-based team. But you can take steps to be not 100% reactive, and have a greater portion of your full work-set be proactive over time.  • *Automate as much as you can for things related to putting out fires, and get your intake process for RevOps requests really solid.* Then you can review your completed work and match up requests to roadmap items (or not, because of the reactive:proactive ratio, not everything will map and that's ok). Then you can show that you're working strategically, and how much, and improve it over time. We shifted from Asana to Notion to be able to do this. Shoutout to <@Ufcf5e7e> for his support in helping my team improve our intake! • *Be the one that is forward looking.* What's coming down the pipeline? The people dealing with fires and reactive stuff don't have the luxury of thinking about this. You might need to spend extra time outside of normal work hours in the beginning, in a transition, to even be able to afford it yourself.   **Reply**: I treat the stakeholders I work with as clients and hold regular project update meetings. In my meetings I share my project management view (created in notion) and each project is tied to high level goals of the company (goal to increase avg deal value? These are the projects we're working on to help achieve).   New intentionally aligned with the goals of csuite/leadership and show them clearly how your work will help them achieve their goals and make their lives easier.  **Reply**: I'm in the same stage as George, and these tips were great! Thank you <@U45c5592> and <@U658de17>! 	* Research things related to RevOps Roadmaps * Automate as much as you can for things related to putting out fires, and get your intake process for REvOps requests really solid * Be the one that is forward looking * Treat stakeholders as clients and hold regular project update meetings
What are popular "churn reason" options on a dropdown field for a B2B SaaS company?	## Message: :wave: Hi All,  Creating a *churn reason* field for a B2B SaaS company. Would love to hear what options your company captures in a typical drop-down field for churn?  9 Replies: **Reply**: It seems to rollup into a few categories: • Sales error • Onboarding challenge • Product limitation • Service / Support gaps • Pricing or terms pressure • Competitor replacement • Payment issue / dispute • Corporate event (M&amp;A or retirement) There are probably others but that's the range from the top of my head.  **Reply**: What <@Uc2de5ba> listed and: • Budget Constraints • Other priorities • Management shift  **Reply**: This can be captured in the same field or in a separate field, but capturing voluntary (switching to new tool) vs involuntary (company shut down) is something that I’ve needed to delineate for a lot of board level reporting  **Reply**: Pricing, Timing, Product, Competitor  **Reply**: I don’t love competitor as a drop-down for churn reason personally, there’s always a more actionable underlying reason  Competitor loss we capture in a separate object that’s leveraged on both churn and newbiz closed/lost opptys  **Reply**: We have close reason and then sub reasons (I think it’s to much) But one thing I do like is our competitive fields  On the competitor field- we have 3  1. for when the sale starts “incumbent”  2. In deal “competition” 3. closed lost “lost to” (competition or incumbent is filled out)   **Reply**: Tip - also add "Churn Sentiment" Postive, Neutral, Negative - will help your team to decide who to approach again if circumstances change.  **Reply**: We capture at 2 levels: Level 1: Churn category -  Business, Product, Onboarding, Support Level 2: details - this is a free text field  **Reply**: Thank you all! Huge help! 	* Sales error * Onboarding challenge * Product limitation * Service / Support gaps * Pricing or terms pressure * Competitor replacement * Payment issue / dispute * Corporate event (M&A or retirement) * Budget Constraints * Other priorities * Management shift
