# Objective: Make a DataFrame using the Abalone dataset (../data/abalone.csv).
# Take two independent random samples of different sizes from the 'rings' field.
# HINT: np.random.choice(df['rings'],10,replace=False) takes 10 random values
# Use box plots to show that the samples do derive from the same population.
######

# Perform imports here:


# create a DataFrame from the .csv file:


# take two random samples of different sizes:


# create a data variable with two Box plots:


# add a layout


# create a fig from data & layout, and plot the fig
