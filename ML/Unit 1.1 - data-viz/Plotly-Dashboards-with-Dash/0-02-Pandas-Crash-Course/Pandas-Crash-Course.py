# We'll use pandas more than numpy in the Course
# so let's quickly go over a few main ideas with pandas!

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


# Reading in CSV files. Use the read_csv command.
# More options: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html
df = pd.read_csv("salaries.csv")

print(df)


# You can select columns with a bracket call:
print(df["Name"])


print(df["Salary"])


# Select multiple columns with a list of column names.
# Since you are passing in a list, you see two sets of []
print(df[["Name", "Salary"]])


# Similar to NumPy, you can create calls of min(), max(), mean(), etc...
# on a pandas dataframe.

print(df["Age"].mean())


# Just like Numpy, we can use conditional filtering to select rows that meet
# certain critera. Like choosing rows where the Age value is greater than 30

ser_of_bool = df["Age"] > 30
print(ser_of_bool)

# Use this filter of booleans to then select the rows

age_filter = df["Age"] > 30

# Pass it to the dataframe
print(df[age_filter])


# More commonly done all in one step:
df[df["Age"] > 30]


# There are lots of other commands you can do with pandas!
# But for now, we'll just talk about a few more, and then introduce the rest
# as we continue through the course :)

df["Age"].unique()  # list of unique values for Age
df["Age"].nunique()  # number of unqiue values
df.info()  # General info about your dataframe
df.describe()  # Statistics about your dataframe
df.columns  # Grab a list of all columns
df.index  # Create an index list
# You can convert a numpy matrix to a dataframe with:
mat = np.arange(50).reshape(5, 10)
