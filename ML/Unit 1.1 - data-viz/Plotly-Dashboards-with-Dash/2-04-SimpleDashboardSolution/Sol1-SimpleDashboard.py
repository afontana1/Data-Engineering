# Objective: build a dashboard that imports OldFaithful.csv
# from the data directory, and displays a scatterplot.
# The field names are:
# 'D' = date of recordings in month (in August),
# 'X' = duration of the current eruption in minutes (to nearest 0.1 minute),
# 'Y' = waiting time until the next eruption in minutes (to nearest minute).
######

# Perform imports here:
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import pandas as pd

# Launch the application:
app = dash.Dash()

# Create a DataFrame from the .csv file:
df = pd.read_csv("../data/OldFaithful.csv")

# Create a Dash layout that contains a Graph component:
app.layout = html.Div(
    [
        dcc.Graph(
            id="old_faithful",
            figure={
                "data": [go.Scatter(x=df["X"], y=df["Y"], mode="markers")],
                "layout": go.Layout(
                    title="Old Faithful Eruption Intervals v Durations",
                    xaxis={"title": "Duration of eruption (minutes)"},
                    yaxis={"title": "Interval to next eruption (minutes)"},
                    hovermode="closest",
                ),
            },
        )
    ]
)

# Add the server clause:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server()
