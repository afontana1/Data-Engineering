# Objective: Create a stacked bar chart from
# the file ../data/mocksurvey.csv. Note that questions appear in
# the index (and should be used for the x-axis), while responses
# appear as column labels.  Extra Credit: make a horizontal bar chart!

# Perform imports here:
import plotly.offline as pyo
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import pandas as pd

# create a DataFrame from the .csv file:
df = pd.read_csv("../data/mocksurvey.csv", index_col=0)

# create traces using a list comprehension:
data = [go.Bar(x=df.index, y=df[response], name=response) for response in df.columns]

# create a layout, remember to set the barmode here
layout = go.Layout(title="Mock Survey Results", barmode="stack")

# create a fig from data & layout, and plot the fig
fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)
pyo.plot(fig, filename="solution3a.html")
