# Objective: Create a stacked bar chart from
# the file ../data/mocksurvey.csv. Note that questions appear in
# the index (and should be used for the x-axis), while responses
# appear as column labels.  Extra Credit: make a horizontal bar chart!

# Perform imports here:


# create a DataFrame from the .csv file:


# create traces using a list comprehension:


# create a layout, remember to set the barmode here


# create a fig from data & layout, and plot the fig.
