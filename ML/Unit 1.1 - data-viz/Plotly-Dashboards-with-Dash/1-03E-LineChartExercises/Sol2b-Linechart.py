## NOTE: ADVANCED SOLUTION THAT USES ONLY PURE DF CALLS
## THIS IS FOR MORE ADVANCED PANDAS USERS TO TAKE A LOOK AT! :)

#######
# Objective: Using the file 2010YumaAZ.csv, develop a Line Chart
# that plots seven days worth of temperature data on one graph.
# You can use a for loop to assign each day to its own trace.
######

# Perform imports here:
import plotly.offline as pyo
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas DataFrame from 2010YumaAZ.csv
df = pd.read_csv("../data/2010YumaAZ.csv")

# Define a data variable
data = [
    {"x": df["LST_TIME"], "y": df[df["DAY"] == day]["T_HR_AVG"], "name": day}
    for day in df["DAY"].unique()
]

# Define the layout
layout = go.Layout(
    title="Daily temperatures from June 1-7, 2010 in Yuma, Arizona", hovermode="closest"
)

# Create a fig from data and layout, and plot the fig
fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)
pyo.plot(fig, filename="solution2b.html")
