# Objective: Using the "flights" dataset available
# from the data folder as flights.csv
# create a heatmap with the following parameters:
# x-axis="year"
# y-axis="month"
# z-axis(color)="passengers"
######

# Perform imports here:
import plotly.offline as pyo
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from  "flights" data
df = pd.read_csv("../data/flights.csv")

# Define a data variable
data = [go.Heatmap(x=df["year"], y=df["month"], z=df["passengers"])]

# Define the layout
layout = go.Layout(title="Flights")
# Create a fig from data and layout, and plot the fig
fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)
pyo.plot(fig, filename="solution8.html")

# Excellent! This shows two distinct trends - an increase in
# passengers flying over the years, and a greater number of
# passengers flying in the summer months.
