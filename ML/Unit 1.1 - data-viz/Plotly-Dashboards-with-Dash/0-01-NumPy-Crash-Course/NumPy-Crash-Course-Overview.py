import numpy as np

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

arr = np.array(my_list)

print(arr)


# arange integers, takes in start,stop, and step size

a = np.arange(0, 10)
print(a)

a = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
print(a)

# Create an array of zeros

a = np.zeros((5, 5))
print(a)

# Create an array of ones

a = np.ones((2, 4))
print(a)

# Create an array of random integers (uniform distribution between limits)

a = np.random.randint(0, 10)
print(a)

# Create 2d matrix of random ints

a = np.random.randint(0, 10, (3, 3))
print(a)

# Create linearly spaced array
a = np.linspace(0, 10, 6)
print(a)


a = np.linspace(0, 10, 101)
print(a)

#### Numpy Operations #########
##############################

# Setting a seed allows you to get the same "random" numbers that we do
# This is really nice for testing, so you can compare results
np.random.seed(101)  # watch video for details
arr = np.random.randint(0, 100, 10)
print(arr)
# If you call this again, you will get a different set of random integers than
# the first time you called it. But both sets will be the same to someone else's
# who also ran these 2 calls immediately after setting the same seed.
arr2 = np.random.randint(0, 100, 10)
print(arr2)


# Simple operations

print(arr.max())

print(arr.min())

print(arr.mean())

# Index location of min
print(arr.argmin())

print(arr.argmax())

print(arr.reshape(2, 5))

###########################
#### Indexing ############
#########################

# You can use .reshape() to change the shape of a 1d array to a 2d,3d, etc.. array
# Keep in mind, we will mainly be working with 2d tabular data.
mat = np.arange(0, 100).reshape(10, 10)
print(mat)

row = 0
col = 1

# Selecting an individual number:
print(mat[row, col])

# Select an entire column (all row entries of this column "col")
print(mat[:, col])

# Select an entire column (all row entries of this column "col")
print(mat[row, :])


#######################
##### Masking #########
#######################
# Masking allows you to use conditional filters to grab elements
# we'll see this idea used in pandas.

print(mat > 50)


print(mat[mat > 50])


# That is all for NumPy! NumPy is a really large library that does a lot
# more than what we showed here. But for our use cases in visualization, these
# are the basics we need to know for now. Later on we may introduce other
# NumPy concepts.
