**1.** What is the difference between sample mean and population mean?
- [x] Sample mean is the average of a subset of the population, while population mean is the average of the entire population.
- [ ] Sample mean is always smaller than population mean.
- [ ] There is no difference between sample mean and population mean.

**2.** Which of the following method can be used to estimate the variance, mean, and proportion of a population?
- [ ] Sample mean
- [ ] Sample variance
- [x] Point estimation
- [ ] Regression analysis

**3.** Which of the following statements best describes the law of large numbers?
- [ ] The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean becomes more variable.
- [x] The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the population mean with increasing accuracy.
- [ ] The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample variance approaches the population variance.
- [ ] The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample becomes more biased.

**4.** Suppose you flip a coin 10 times and obtain 6 heads and 4 tails. What function needs to be maximized to find the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of getting heads on a single coin toss? Let $p$ be the probability of the coin being heads.
- [ ] $L \left( p \right) = p^{1/6} \left( 1- p \right)^{1/4}$
- [x] $L \left( p \right) = p^{6} \left( 1- p \right)^{4}$
- [ ] $L \left( p \right) = p^{4} \left( 1- p \right)^{6}$
- [ ] $L \left( p \right) = p^{10} \left( 1- p \right)^{0}$

**5.** What is the porpose of regularization in machine learning?
- [ ] Regularization is used to make a model more complex and flexible, which can lead to better performance on the training data.
- [x] Regularization is used to prevent overfitting and reduce the complexity of a model, by adding a penalty term to the loss function that encourages smaller parameter values.
- [ ] Regularization is used to increase the training error of a model, which can improve its generalization performance.
- [ ] Regularization is used to improve the interpretability of a model by reducing its complexity.
