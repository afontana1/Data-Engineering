**1.** Suppose you flip a coin twice and observe the result. Which set below describes the **sample space** of this experiment? I.e., which set describes every possible outcome?

Define: $H$ as heads and $T$ as tails.
- [ ] $\lbrace H, T \rbrace$
- [ ] $\lbrace ( H, T ), ( T, H ) \rbrace$
- [ ] $\lbrace ( H, H ), ( T, T ) \rbrace$
- [x] $\lbrace ( H, T ), ( H, H ), ( T, H ), ( T, T ) \rbrace$

**2.** Let's keep the same experiment: flipping a coin twice. What is the probability of obtaining one head and one tail in this experiment (the order doesn't matter)?
- [x] (A)

$$\frac{1}{2}$$
- [ ] (B)

$$\frac{1}{4}$$
- [ ] (C)

$$\frac{3}{4}$$

**3.** Consider the following experiment:

You throw a dice $10$ times and sum the results. What is the probability of getting a number higher than $10$?

Hint: Use the complement rule!
- [ ] (A)

$$\frac{1}{6^{10}}$$
- [ ] (B)

$$\frac{5}{6}$$
- [ ] (C)

$$\frac{1}{6}$$
- [x] (D)

$$\frac{6^{10}-1}{6^{10}}$$

**4.** If you throw a dice twice and sum the result, what is the probability of getting a $10$?
- [x] (A)

$$\frac{1}{12}$$
- [ ] (B)

$$\frac{1}{9}$$
- [ ] (C)

$$\frac{1}{36}$$
- [ ] (D)

$$\frac{1}{18}$$

**5.** Consider the following problem:

In an experiment there are 100 ill persons. 50 of them have headache and 50 of them have fever. 

The researchers want to find the probability of a random selected person in this experiment having headache **or** fever. One researcher provides the following argument:

"Since 50 out of 100 have headache, the probability of having headache is 1/2. The same reasoning can be applied to having fever. Therefore, the probability that a random selected person has either fever or headache is 1."

About their argument, choose the correct option.
- [x] It is incorrect, because it assumes that the events of having headache and fever are **disjoint**. This cannot be inferred by the experiment as it is stated.
- [ ] It is correct, because in this case it is an application of the sum of probabilities.
- [ ] It is incorrect, because instead of summing up the probabilities, the researcher should have multiplied it.
- [ ] It is correct, because the sum of persons with headache and with fever is exactly 100.
