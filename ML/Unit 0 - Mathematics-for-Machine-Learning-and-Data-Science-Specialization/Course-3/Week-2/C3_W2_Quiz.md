**6.** Suppose that the joint probability distribution of two random variables X and Y is given by the following table:

$$\begin{matrix} \text{X/Y} & | & 1 & 2 & 3 \cr \hline 1 & | & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.3 \cr 2 & | & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.1 \end{matrix}$$

- [ ] $0.4$

**7.** About the correlation coeficient, it is correct to say (check all that apply):
- [ ] It is always positive real number.
- [ ] It can be any real number.
- [x] It measures how linearly correlated two variables are.
- [x] It is a real number between -1 and 1.

**8.** Suppose that the joint probability distribution of two random variables X and Y is given by the following table:

$$\begin{matrix} \text{X/Y} & | & 0 & 1 \cr \hline 0 & | & 0.2 & 0.1 \cr 1 & | & 0.1 & 0.6 \end{matrix}$$
