What can be said about the curveâ€™s slopes at the red point, which we will call P1, P2, P3 and P4, corresponding to the red points in the graphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively?
- [ ] Slope(P1) > 0, Slope(P2) < 0, Slope(P3) does not exist, Slope(P4) = 0.
- [ ] Slope(P1) < 0, Slope(P2) = 0, Slope(P3) > 0, Slope(P4) does not exist.
- [x] Slope(P1) < 0, Slope(P2) = 0, Slope(P3) does not exist, Slope(P4) does not exist.
- [ ] Slope(P1) < 0, Slope(P2) = 0, Slope(P3) does not exist, Slope(P4) > 0.

**4.** Let $y_1 = ax + b$ and $y_2 = cx + d$, where $a, b, c, d \in \Bbb R$. Check all the sentences that are true.
- [x] The slope of $y_1$ is $a$.
- [ ] The slope of $y_1$ is $- \frac ab$.
- [x] If $a > c$ then the slope of $y_1$ is greater than the slope of $y_2$.
- [x] The slope of $y_1$ does not depend on $b$.

**5.** Which of the following sentences are true (check all that apply)?
- [ ] If the slope of a function is constant, then the function is constant.
- [ ] If the slope of a function is always positive, then the function is always positive.
- [ ] Let $f, g$ be real functions. If $f'(x) > g'(x)$ then $f(x) > g(x)$.
- [x] Let $f$ be a real function. If $f'(x) > 0$ for every $x$ in $\Bbb R$, then $f$ is increasing.
