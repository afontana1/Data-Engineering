**1. Solve the system of equations using the method of elimination and select the correct answer.**

$$\begin{cases} x + y = 4 \cr -6x + 2y = 16 \end{cases}$$

- [ ] The system has infinitely many solutions.
- [ ] $x = 1, y = 3$
- [x] $x = -1, y = 5$
- [ ] The system has no solution.
- [ ] $x = 0, y = 0$

**2. For the questions 2-3, calculate the determinant of the matrices and determine if the matrices are singular or non-singular:**

$$\begin{bmatrix} 4 & -3 \cr 7 & -8 \end{bmatrix}$$

- [ ] -53, Singular
- [x] -11, Non-singular
- [ ] -53, Non-singular
- [ ] -11, Singular

**3.**

$$\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 8 & 1 \cr 2 & 2 & -1 \cr -5 & 6 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$

- [ ] 36, Non-singular
- [ ] -80, Non-singular
- [ ] -20, Non-singular
- [ ] 0, Non-singular
- [x] 0, Singular

**4. Determine if the provided matrix has linearly dependent or independent rows (a, b, c, d, e, f are any real numbers):**

$$\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \cr d & e & f \cr 2a - d & 2b - e & 2c - f \end{bmatrix}$$

Hint: Can one row in the matrix be obtained as a result of operations on the other rows?
- [ ] Independent
- [ ] It cannot be determined.
- [x] Dependent

**5. Which of the following operations, when applied to the rows of the matrix, do not change the singularity (or non-singularity) of the matrix:**
- [x] Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar.
- [x] Switching rows.
- [x] Adding a row to another one. 
- [ ] Adding a nonzero fixed value to every entry of the row.

**6. In the following matrix:**

$$\begin{bmatrix} a & a \cr b & c \end{bmatrix}$$

**a, b, and c are non-zero real numbers. If the matrix is non-singular, which of the following must be true:**
- [x] a = b only if c ≠ a 
- [ ] c = a only if a = b
- [x] c ≠ b
- [ ] c = b

**7.** Luis went yesterday to the bank to find out the interest rate of three different financial instruments. He received the following information:

| Financial instrument | Savings account | Certificate of Deposit (CD) | Bonds |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Annual interest | 2% | 3% | 4% |

He wants to invest his USD $10,000 savings in these three accounts. By doing so, he knows that after a year he would receive a total of US $ 260 in interest if he put twice as much money in the savings account as in the CDs, and “z” money in bonds.

**Calculate the value of “z” , in USD, using the elimination method explained in the lectures.**
- [ ] $z = \text{USD}$ $5600
- [ ] It cannot be determined.
- [x] $z = \text{USD}$ $1600
- [ ] $z = \text{USD}$ $2800
