{"title": "Sounds good", "body": "I'm updating my review because I realized it wasn't the headphones that were cutting out, but rather the loose connection with headphone jack in the mp3 player. The headphone construction is fine, and I got the sound to stop cutting out as well, so they sound great now. It was an error on my part.These are fairly well built ear buds that have pretty decent sound once you adjust the equalizer. They are great for isolating noise, but they're no good for running because you can hear yourself breathing and your feet hitting the ground. These function like ear plugs so if you put in a pair of ear plugs you'll get an idea of what I mean about the breathing and walking noise.I like the sound, and their noise isolation is very good. These are great for lifting and walking, but I wouldn't use them for running because of the potential safety hazard. I'd get the PMX II 80 wraparound design for that. I have those for running and they're the best design I've ever found for that purpose. They simply will not slip (because they can't), sound great, can be washed, and don't provide noise isolation so you can run outdoors with them and not fear getting hit by a car because you couldn't hear it. This design is much better suited to indoor exercise, weight lifting, etc. I've never found earbuds to be suitable for running. No matter how good they are, they fall out.You can use these at a lower volume than non-noise isolating headphones because with the background noise cut out, you don't need nearly as much volume. This makes them better for your hearing as long as you don't turn them way up.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Well it's not as bad as I thought.", "body": "I've been using Razer mice since the Boomslang ball mouse. I have and love the Razer Orochi wireless Bluetooth mouse. (I also have several corded Razer mice I have retired) I just kept having issues with Bluetooth disconnecting on the Orochi. I need an accurate mouse for my work and thought I'd give the G700 a try. Typically the precision and fluidity of the Razer gaming mice are perfect for the kind of accuracy I look for with my work. I thought with the DPI and polling rate settings and options with the G700, it would be a great replacement mouse for accuracy and after some tweaking and a different mouse pad, I'm happy with this mouse.Pros for me: The amount of programmable buttons. This is great. I'm a keyboard shortcut person and when I can assign commonly used keyboard tasks to a mouse button, that's even better. The DPI options and polling rate settings are also a huge plus. You can set the mouse to move as fast or as slow as you are comfortable with. There are up to 5 DPI settings for quick switching up to 5,700 DPI.Another pro is the rechargeable battery although I don't use it. It's easier to keep a 4 battery charger where you always have a charged battery at the ready. And this mouse only uses one AA battery.Well I deleted a not-so-favorable review. After giving this mouse another change with a different mouse pad. TheRazer Kabuto Mobile Mouse Mat (Black)which is an amazing mouse pad. This Logitech G700 mouse now works really well. I need precision for my work and with the various DPI and polling rate settings this mouse delivers smooth precision (when combined with the proper surface).I still switch between this and my newRazer Orochi Elite Mobile Gaming Mouse(don't pay more than $69.99 for it) But I really recommend the G700.Why not 5 stars? I still get a laggy jerky response on occasion. Not sure if it's interference from something or what. But that's really my only issue with this mouse.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "i likey a lot!", "body": "This laptop is an excellent value! I purchased mine at best buy for $400 plus tax. what a steal!For a pc, Samsung always seems to have high quality trackpads & keyboards so i am partial to the samsung brand. I have a Samsung Netbook that has served me well for the last 4 years, but I am back in school so I need something more powerful. I recently ordered the 12.5\" samsung laptop but when i saw this deal I ordered this too. (The idea was to return one of them, but I may end up keeping both because this laptop is a bit large to lug around on campus....)PROS:*The set-up was quick & easy, I did not have any issues whatsoever.*It is definitely a pretty zippy laptop. My first restart was kind of slow but then a window popped up asking me if I want to optimize for a quicker start-up. I hit yes & it took 3 mins to configure. I restarted again, and it was much much faster. No issues with speed.*The track-pad & keyboard are working great, as I expected, and I am quite pleased with their performance. No weird flexing on the keyboard & the keys are nicely spaced. No issues typing. The track-pad works PERFECTLY, I am very pleased with it.*I have tested the battery out & got roughly 5 hrs out of it while running security updates, surfing the web with several windows open, playing mafia wars on facebook, & then running a netflix movie.  I recharged fully and tested again, this time playing a movie from the disc drive. (the departed, run time 151 minutes) then surfed the web and I got about 3 1/2 hours out of it.*The screen is matte which some people do not like, but I much prefer the matte to glossy screens so I am making this a pro. (with glossy screens I always end up having to purchase a glare filter.)*The sound is good, I am happy with the quality.*I can sit comfortably with this on my lap, at around 5lbs it feels very light and it is almost as comfortable as my netbook was on my lap. After a long time I can feel the difference. (especially with my legs outstretched on the coffee table, when i finally went to get up i noticed. but we are talking several hours...)*The fan is silent. Granted, I haven't used it for heavy gaming or any intense programs like Photoshop, so I can't comment on how it would run then.  But for web surfing, streaming netflix movies & other basic uses it is very fast & the fan is very quiet.*The 4 usb ports (2 on each side) are more than enough for my needs. I am glad to have more than 2 as many of the new smaller, lighter laptops have. I don't really use any other ports so i'm not concerned with them.*It's nice to have a CD/DVD drive, the new ultra-portables sacrifice a disc drive for a lighter build.CONS:*The case isn't quite as pretty as other Samsung laptops out now. It is light silver with a thick black strip. I'd prefer it to be the same color black or gray all over like the others have.*Lack of pre-installed software---it comes with a trial of Norton security & a limited version of Microsoft office that has just word & excel. Otherwise you don't get much besides \"easy software manager\", \"easy support center\", and \"easy settings\". (this is ok by me, i usually delete all the bloatware and I have my own preferred programs for security.)*The wireless connection isn't as strong as on my Samsung netbook. I live in a basement apartment and the netbook detects everywhere, but this laptop doesn't connect when I was in the very back of the apartment, in the area farthest away from the wireless router that I share with the upstairs. Also it shows a weak connection of 2 bars in all areas of my apartment but there has not been any disruption to the service so I guess that is no big deal.*The CD/DVD drive feels flimsy. When I push the button it ejects it out partially & then I have to pull it all the way out by hand and it does wobble a bit once fully extended. Also the quality isn't the greatest. I inserted a disc to play a movie. It made lots of noise like it was trying to read the disc but it didn't play. tried a few times, same result. Finally figured out that you have to open media player first, then insert the disc in order to play a DVD movie. Otherwise it won't play.  And it does make detectable sounds at times, like between the previews and right before the movie came on, and i noticed that if you pause, reduce the screen while it is running, or switch from full screen and back you can hear it. Once the movie was running it was silent for 10 mins, but then inexplicably i could hear the drive running for a few moments again. then it stopped for a minute before starting again. this cycle continued off and on throughout video play. It would be less noticeable if it was just running the whole time. (It's not really loud, but when it keeps starting and stopping it is more noticeable.)*My Samsung netbook's track-pad has a spot on the right side that you can run your finger on to scroll up & down. Very handy. I was a little disappointed to see that this laptop doesn't have the exact same track-pad & is missing that feature. The features it does have work properly, but I will really miss having the scroll function.***Overall I definitely recommend to give it a try. Just order from best buy to save some $. Just hang onto your receipt so you can return it for a refund by mail or in-store, within 14 days if you are not happy.EDIT 2/6/12---i just a rec'd a 12.5\" samsung laptop that i ordered, it came with info on the trackpad, states that if you drag two fingers up or down on the trackpad it scrolls. So i tried that on this laptop and it works but it is not sensitive to always work if you go too fast. It may take some getting used to but at least it has a scroll function :)", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Unbeatable performance for the price, the more I use it the more I love it...", "body": "==== UPDATE October 2, 2007 ====I bought aNav-Mat Portable GPS Dash Mountfor use in trips to California, where it is illegal to attach a GPS to your windshield. The Nav-Mat bean bag mount simply works great with the Mio C520 and is very stable. Check out the picture under customer images.==== UPDATE August 21, 2007 ====The following statement was in my original review and has been removed: \"If you plan to use it in Europe, just Google \"MioMap V3.3 Western Europe for Mio C220 - C320 - C520\" and you should find some UK vendors who sell the SD card.\"The fact is that although there are vendors in UK who sell the Europe map, the current Europe maps cannot be used in US/Canada models of C520 due to a license issue. Sorry if this caused confusion. Please read the forums at mionav dot com for updates on this issue.==== UPDATE August 16, 2007 ====I updated MioMap to the July 5, 2007 version, still v3.3, following the directions in MioNav dot com, which is linked to the Mio topics in the gpspassion dot com forums. (Search for the topic \"Updates for miomap V3.3 are available\" and you will find a link to download \"MioMap V3 Updater for C320 and C520\" from Mio's European website).This update cures the stuttering problem reported in some earlier versions of MioMap. It also adds a Mute button on the map screen under the Bluetooth button. It does not update the maps or POI data, and leaves the History intact.==== END UPDATES ====OVERVIEW:After doing tons of research to find a competent GPS navigation system under $350, I narrowed down my choice to two models - the Magellan Maestro 3140 and the Mio Digiwalker C520. I would have also considered the Garmin Nuvi 250, but it lacks both text-to-speech and Bluetooth capability which I wanted. If ease of use is most important, I would say the Magellan Maestro 3140, which is a huge improvement over its predecessor, the Maestro 3100, would have been an excellent choice. But since I was not gadget shy, the Mio Digiwalker C520, with its widescreen form factor and advanced capabilities was the unit for me.The Mio C520 packs in US and Canadian maps with text-to-speech routing instructions, Bluetooth, an MP3 player, a video player, a picture viewer and a contact manager that synchronizes with MS Outlook. The installation is pretty painless. The suction cup holder, which is precision made in Germany, works very well and easily installs onto the windscreen of any car (contrary to what the previous reviewer claims). The Mio works right out of the box with instructions in the tiny manual. If you are willing read the full manual located in the supplied CDROM, and go through a very minor learning curve, you will find the user interface most satisfying and will profit from its awesome capabilities.It has some cool features, like the ability to display map coordinates and altitude, and has the ability to automatically synchronize time and date with the satellite. It's signal pickup is lightening fast due to the state-of-the-art 20-channel SirfStarIII receiver. It actually picks up the satellite signal from inside my house. If you are further geek-inclined, visit the forums in gpspassion dot com - which show you how to unlock the GPS operating system (Windows CE 5.0) and install custom applications and utilities.Now consider that the street price of the equivalent widescreen Garmin (the Nuvi 660) is $300 more than the Mio C520, and you can understand why the Mio tops MobilePlanet dot com's current popularity list. The Mio is perhaps among the best GPS' out there at any price!EXPERIENCE:On a recent trip to San Francisco with my wife, the Mio turned out to be a real trip saver. It listed our hotel in its point of interest (POI) database and got us to all our destinations without ever getting us lost. Needless to say, it saved us about a couple of hours each day on the trip, even though we were pretty familiar with the Bay Area. Not once did we have to stop for (or argue over) directions! The POI database listed all the major and minor points of interest, including museums, concert halls, gas stations, car rental agencies, seven-elevens, hospitals, etc. It also included hard to find, hole-in-the-wall restaurants. It has restaurants categorized by cuisine, which includes \"Japanese\", \"Greek\", \"Indian\" and so on.While the routing capability is excellent, it is not 100% perfect. (None of the portable GPS models are perfect). While driving on 101 southbound to SFO airport, it asked us to \"bear left on Bayshore freeway southbound\" seconds before asking us to take the San Bruno exit to the airport on the right. While this was not a navigational glitch per se, it did have the potential for causing confusion. (Of course, I later understood that \"bear left\" meant the freeway bears left, not \"get on the left lane\", duh!). A couple of times it asked us to take left turns in downtown San Francisco that were not allowed. When we ignored it, it recalculated the routes in a matter of seconds, without forcing us to take U turns (which some other GPS models make you do).Now lets put that in perspective and take, for example, a day trip to Monterey, Pebble Beach, Carmel and back to San Francisco (consisting of, say, 100 routing manoeuvers). On such a trip, the Mio would give confusing instructions perhaps two or three times in total, which meant it was perfect approximately 97% of the time. This is excellent performance in my book. I am perhaps looking at this with a more critical eye than warranted. The important thing is that Mio C520 recalculated the route the moment it realized we were off route, and always got us to our destination quickly.By considerably reducing the planning chores, the Mio immensely improved the satisfaction of our holiday. We will never go on another trip without it!TEXT TO SPEECHThe text-to-speech (TTS) feature, which causes the Mio to speak the street names, turns out to be valuable, especially when there are a lot of quick turns to make. The TTS (\"Samantha\") voice on the Mio C520 is perhaps a bit brusque but pleasant enough. There is a chime before each voice instruction, which alerts you to an upcoming manoeuver. (The TTS voice is in no way \"HORRIBLE\" or \"VERY\" chatty as described in the previous review. With all due respect to the previous reviewer, his review is pretty opinionated and unfair). The TTS voice did not stutter even once. The version of Mio Map on my unit is dated May 18, 2007. Note that some earlier versions are reported to have a TTS voice stuttering problem.SCREEN:The the 4.3-inch touch screen with 480x272-pixel resolution is vivid and sharp. (The screen is not washed out, as the previous reviewer claims). And it goes without saying you can easily adjust the brightness to your desired level. The touch-screen keyboard is in QUERTY format and has a predictive function, making it easy to enter an address quickly. The automatic night mode feature is pretty neat and wow inducing. It switches to night mode based on time of sunset for the current date, time zone, latitude and logitude!NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE:On the subject of navigation mapping data, the conventional wisdom is that in North America, Navteq data is more accurate than Tele Atlas - which the Mio uses. However, the recent buzz is that Tele Atlas has significantly narrowed the gap with Navteq, especially with its latest map versions released after the fall of 2006. A recent comparison of Navteq versus Tele Atlas in gpsreview dot net actually shows the Tele Atlas' mapping data to be slightly more accurate than Navteq's, while another study in gpsmagazine dot com has the results the other way around.In my own tests, which included comparing the Mio C520's routing with online maps by Yahoo, Google and Mapquest, showed that none of the routing engines were perfect, with Google coming out perhaps slightly better than the others. To my delight, I found that the routes chosen by the Mio C520, which uses the latest Tele Atlas data, is pretty close to those chosen by Yahoo. Rest assured, the navigation performace of the Mio C520 is indeed excellent.ROUTING FEATURES:Typically you would enter an address or POI around the current city. Or you can change the destination city, state or country and enter an address or select a POI for that destination. The Mio also has the ability to route to a contact (an address you entered in the contact manager, under Tools->Contacts).There is a peculiar way you need to enter North American addresses into the contact manager in order for the \"Route to Contact\" feature to work. For example, consider the address: 111 FIRST STREET, APT# 101, FREMONT, CA 94533. You have to enter 'CA, 94533' in the 'State:' field, 'FREMONT' in the 'City/Postcode:', 'FIRST STREET' in the 'Street:' field and 'Apt 101, 111' in the 'House number:' field. (Note that you need to enter the state and zip code separated by a comma in the 'State:' field). Once you enter the contact address as the Mio expects it, it creates the route to the contact address super fast (usually in less than 10 seconds).The Mio has a decent job of position error filtering, which attempts to accurately estimate your car's position on the map. Even when driving at 70MPH on a freeway, the Mio is off by no more than 10 yards. It also estimates the car's speed within 2MPH of my car's odometer reading. When driving on regular streets at around 30MPH, the display of the car position is spot on. There are several split-screen views which you can cycle through, giving you the distance to the next manoeuver, the current time, the estimated time of arrival, etc. If you find the display too busy, you can turn off the panel, giving you a full widescreen routing map.FINAL NOTES:While I have not tried the MP3 or the video player, the Mio has no problem pairing with my Nokia E61 phone with Bluetooth for placing and receiving handsfree calls. There's a whole lot of features I am yet to try out. But I must say that this is a really powerful, well designed GPS Navigation system. There are no gimmicks. So, in conclusion, I highly recommend the Mio C520!!PROS:* Excellent routing engine* Excellent, bright and vivid display* Great, satisfying user interface. (After you get past the initial learning curve).* Huge, well categorized POI database. (6.5 million points of interest!)* Accurate display of current speed, map position and coordinates* 20-channel SirfStarIII receiver which can receive a satellite fix from indoors* QUERTY touch-screen keyboard* Fast text entry by graying out keyboard characters as you type* Text-to-Speech voice that does not stutter (MioMap v3.3, dated May 18, 2007)* Automatic night mode based on current time zone, latitude and longitude* Can be unlocked and tweaked (read the user forums in gpspassion dot com)* Split screen display of itinerary, estimated time, arrival time, next move, current speed, etc.* Track logs* Ability to add via points* Automatic and fast route recalculation* Automatic time and date settings (through the satellite Time Sync feature).* Graphically displays neat info like altitude, GPS signal strength, etc.* Pedestrian mode* 2D & 3D views with flyover and other modesCONS:* There is a slight learning curve to learn the advanced features* Does not include carrying case. (I use a Sony Vaio power supply case for mine)* Needs reboot after days of heavy use* Does not tell you which side of the street your destination is on* Delete History feature does not allow you to selectively delete an address* \"Route to contact\" feature requires peculiar way of entering the contact address.* Only one TTS voice", "rating": "pos"}

Of course this isn't L glass, nor is it L construction or feel. Check the MTF charts, it's not going to be as sharp or have as much contrast, but let me say that it is a great lens for the kit-lens-owning photographer looking for a bump up.The focus on this lens is fast and accurate, and image quality is delicious, and you never have to fight with it to fix it on a focus point unlike a few other \"all-purpose walkabout\" lenses that I've used. Colors are vibrant and it's stellar throughout pretty much all of its range. The spinny-uppy IS is nice to grab a few extra stops when shooting in available light, too. I'm able to pull off shots that wouldn't be possible without a *pod or pushing up the ISO.

{"title": "Amazon \"Frustration-Free\" Packaging: Yeah, right.", "body": "I bought this because my LG Xenon (GR 500) was in dire need of more space.

Plug-n-Play.  Was perfect for my cellphone, a LG Xenon.  Just popped the little sucker in and away I go.  Phone automatically formats it appropriately for use in both the cellphone and the computer, and can easily switch between the two.3.  Shipping time.  Depending on where you live, Amazon has GREAT shipping time.  This product is no exception. Amazon shipping is an A+!CONS --1. Amazon frustration-free packaging is the goofiest thing I have ever heard of.  Not only did I need scissors to get into the packaging still, but the packaging was still TIGHTLY wrapped around the memory card.  I thought part of frustration-free was so that one did not have to actually CUT on/near the card to get the damn thing out.  Just go with the regular packaging.2.  Getting the mini card in and out of the adapter.  Even though I'm a woman and I have fingernails, it is really hard to easily switch this thing in and out of the adapter.  The mini is (obviously) tiny to begin with, but you put it into a slightly larger card and then insert into your computer, it makes it kinda difficult.  Also, the mini slides into the MIDDLE of the 'larger' SD card, making it harder to get it back out.", "rating": "pos"}

After 3 weeks I've determined this hasn't made any significant improvement.  Zero improvement in signal strength, connectivity, range, or bandwidth compared to the stock antenna.  Obviously the best solution for my situation would be a router upgrade to N or AC but for $8 I figured this was worth a shot.  There are 4 walls between my router and my living room recliner, maybe 35 feet.  This antenna didn't improve any aspect of my wifi coverage.EDIT: Changing Review to 4 StarAfter returning this antenna and going back to the OEM one and using it for a few weeks I did in fact find much less signal strength than with the TP-Link and more dropped connections.  I think my expectations were not quite up to what this type of router modification could accomplish.  I tried another brand antenna and found it to work as well as this one did.  I don't see any reason why you wouldn't want some extra coverage and signal strength.  Even in a wifi crowded location having a more powerful signal could theoretically help.  But it's best to use a WiFi Explorer and find out what channels your neighbors are using and try to pick one with the least amount of noise.If you can't afford to upgrade to a newer router with N or AC, this inexpensive antenna will be a benefit.  If you're using B or G, you still won't have the coverage you'll get with a N router but it will help.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "For me, a near-perfect audio player", "body": "I have used the same player (Creative Zen Nano Plus) for several years and have been very happy with it.  Still, this player offers SO many advantages at a low price that getting one was a no-brainer.  This is not an exhaustive list of what it can do, but it is the features that I wanted that got me to buy a new Clip+.  On top of all of these features, it SOUNDS GREAT!Aside from a review, you'll also find ideas for getting more out of your player, Clip+ or other kinds.UPDATE 3/19/2012Lately the sound of one channel has been intermittent, and this happens with most earphones I have tried.  It is better with some than others.  The earphones work properly with other devices, so I am certain it is not a problem with the plugs.  I have found a way of turning the plug and applying pressure in a certain way that makes it work right, but it looks like I will have to replace it soon.  I took a star off, and may take another.  This is a critical failure on an otherwise 100% wonderful unit.BUILT-IN RECHARGEABLE BATTERYThis is the real reason I bought the new unit.  My old player is great, but needs a new AAA battery on a regular basis.  The cost of these batteries quickly adds up to the cost of a new Clip+, and dead batteries add to landfill.  The Clip+ can be recharged with a computer via USB cable, or you can buy a very inexpensive USB power adapter (often under $2 with shipping).I have seen some complaints that in practice, the player does not achieve the full 15 hours of playback said to be available on one charge.  There's a reason for this.  The 15 hours is the maximum, based on mp3 files created with 128k bps, probably with the display as dim as it will go, and with no keys pressed to light it up again.  Many of us use higher quality bit rates, up to 320k bps.  Higher quality bit rates require more processing, which in turn consumes more electricity.  Since 320k is 2.5 times the rated 128k rate, it would not surprise me if the battery life with those tracks was more like 15 hours / 2.5 = 6 hours.Even rechargeable batteries do not last forever, and I think it would be very hard to replace the battery in this device, so it won't last forever either, but it should last some years.GAPLESS PLAYBACKSome albums have tracks that move from one to the other without silence between - Beatles Abbey Road, Radiohead OK Computer, many others.  Others are designed to have a brief silence at the end of the track (which can be removed while ripping).  The Clip+ plays either one correctly: it plays music uninterrupted from one track to the next if they are set up that way.  My old player had a brief silence while it loaded the next track.  My mobile phone makes a loud click then fades into the next track, missing the first half second or so.  I no longer have to rip contiuous albums as a single mp3 to be played correctly on my player.AUTO VOLUME ADJUSTMENT / REPLAYGAIN SUPPORTMusic is recorded at many volume levels.  You might turn up the player to listen to a quiet track, then get blasted by a loud track.  A technology called Replaygain is available to help normalize track volume to avoid this problem, and this player supports it.EXPANDABLE MEMORYThere's a slot on the side into which you can plug a MicroSD or MicroSDHC chip, which can bring between 1 GB to 32 GB of additional storage to your Clip+.  As I write, the price difference between a 2GB Clip+ and a 8GB Clip+ is more than $26 for 6 GB additional built-in memory.  For that much money, you can buy almost 24 GB memory via 4GB or 8GB chips, and the price of the chips is dropping.  For that reason, I suggest buying a 2GB or 4GB player and spending the savings on expansion chips.These expansion chips weigh very little and you can potentially carry a lot of music around with you without noticing the extra weight.  The chips can have customized music programs to make portable playback very flexible.With an SD adapter sleeve (that usually comes with the micro chips), the same chip can be played on my n&uuml;vi GPS, with the music and driving directions alternating as needed.  Your memory chip will probably work with other music devices that have a socket, too.  With the adapter you can also use these chips in your camera or other SD devices, handy if you run out of space for pictures.PLAYLISTSStandard M3U playlists can be used to set up lists of tracks you want to hear, in the order you want to hear them.  You can set the play mode to shuffle so the order is not always the same, if you want.  My old player played tracks only in alphanumeric sort order, so I had to insert numbers on tracks to get them to come out in a particular order.  M3U is perhaps the most common type of playlist, and is widely supported.UPDATEABLE, REPLACEABLE FIRMWAREI am reasonably satisified with the Sansa firmware (see Cons below for a minor issue), and they have updated it to add new features (like the ability to play files by browsing directories, without a playlist).The Clip+ is also supported by the open-source Rockbox firmware, which improves on the Sansa firmware in many useful ways.  It is fairly easy to install, and once it's there, you can switch between the original and the Rockbox firmware as you like.  Because Rockbox is open source, you could customize the way your player works.NO REMOVABLE / BREAKABLE PARTSMy old player has a plastic battery cover that broke, so it does not stay in place very well.  Removable or moving parts are the first thing to break on these devices.  Aside from the buttons and connectors, this player has none.  And it is so light that even dropping it is unlikely to break it.TRACK RATINGI love this feature!  It means that while I do my exercise walking, I can rate a track on the player, and when I get home, transfer the ratings to my music database, so that in the future I can select tracks by my own rating.USES STANDARD CONNECTORSThe Sansa Fuze, any Apple player, and many others tend to have proprietary connectors, especially for the computer connection, which require expensive adapters and limit your flexibility to connect to whatever you want.  The Clip+ accepts a standard mini-B USB plug, which is commonly used for many small USB devices from many vendors.  The headphone jack is the same as all players: the 1/8\" (3.5mm) stereo plug is accepted.WORKS WITH STANDARD SOFTWAREThe Clip+, like many other players, allows you to use iTunes or any other software you might prefer - MediaMonkey, WinAmp, Windows Media Player, drag-and-drop from your file list, or your own custom-written software.  Apple requires iTunes for loading and playing tracks on its players, because there is a proprietary database on the player that is used for playing (I have heard that some people have figured out how the database works and written alternatives; also, some mp3 management software does support the Apple proprietary database).COMPACT, AND NOT TOO SMALLThe problem with really small players is they are easy to lose.  To me, this one is as small as I would want.COLORSI prefer brightly colored players, because they are easier to find in my bag (which is black inside), and because I like bright colors.  The colors for Clip+ are a bit dark, but are otherwise pleasing, and there are a few choices.NO VIDEO PLAYBACK / PICTURESPlayers that show video and pictures require larger, more expensive displays which also shorten the battery life, are bigger and heavier, and of course are more expensive.  Obviously the need to show video and pictures is a personal thing, and if you need it, don't choose the Clip+, which only plays music.  With Rockbox, there are actually a few small apps and games that work on Clip+.BOOKMARK / RESUMEIf you are listening to an mp3 book, it is very convenient to have the player remember where you were when you stopped, and resume there.  This player supports that.RADIOThis player includes an FM radio, as many do.  The autoscan missed some of the weaker stations, such as the college stations, when I tried it indoors, but it receives the other local stations very well.  You can record from radio, too.CONS(Warning, geek talk follows.)  The player requires that playlists use relative pathnames only, not absolute pathnames.  When the mp3 file location starts with a slash, it is absolute, and the player won't find it.  This defect limits the flexibility of using playlists, and causes problems for some mp3 organizers (such as MediaMonkey, though there could be a solution).  But if you install Rockbox, this problem goes away.TIPS FOR USING ANY PORTABLE AUDIO PLAYERTo keep costs down, player manufacturers provide a very cheap headphone.  Don't judge the player by the quality of this headphone.  You can get headphones that sound great for cheap money these days; for example, I like Koss \"The Plug,\" which seals out noise around me; these days, there are many other good choices at all price ranges and qualities.I recommend one accessory: a cable that has a 1/8\" plug on one end (plugs into the player) and a pair of RCA plugs on the other (plugs into your home stereo or other audio players around the home).  I have a few of these cables, and connected them to every device with speakers in the house.  So when I'm in the kitchen, I can easily listen to the Clip+ through the radio, when the radio isn't what I want to hear.Don't limit yourself to music.  Podcasts are a great way to learn.  Books on tape can be very entertaining while walking or driving.  One of my favorite: learning foreign languages during my daily exercise walk.  I sometimes even listen to recorded presentations for my job to expand my expertise.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Classic Style Still The Best...", "body": "I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the \"better mousetrap\" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic.

{"title": "Excellence in the palm of your hand.", "body": "For the longest time I was using a Logitech wireless mouse for my netbook (when using it in a place where I have the space to be able to use a mouse). My original choice was based on the idea that I wanted a small mouse that was easy to transport, but not those comically small ones that are both easy to lose and difficult to use. It had to be wireless and it had to be cheap. On all counts, Logitech scores pretty well, and I know they continue to make quality mice.This little mouse showed up in Amazon's Gold Box one day and I couldn't resist. Its amazing what an extra $5 off will get you to buy, but I am so happy with the result. First off, the wireless USB plug is tiny. This is good, provided you don't drop it somewhere. This should allow you to plug into just about any USB port on your computer, whether its on the same side as your mouse hand or the opposite, or even the front or back, without creating an obstruction. Obviously, if you want to use this for a desktop--by no means would this be a bad desktop mouse--this doesn't really apply to you. The USB plug should be pretty difficult to lose because it should either be in your computer or plugged into the undercarriage of the mouse.This is actually ideal for a few reasons. I know plugging the USB jack into the mouse for storage is an idea only 5 minutes newer than the idea of wireless mice, but the way this mouse stores the USB jack is second-to-none. It may not be able to be done better. It plugs in so that its flush with the rest of the bottom of the mouse, and then you can press a button and it will spit it out a few millimeters so you can grab it. Excellent. This is a small thing, but it is superior to a lot of other mice out there that store it either internally by flipping up the back of the mouse--inconvenient, albeit minimal--or housing it externally where it could be easily knocked loose.Likewise, the battery is replaced on the bottom of the mouse. I know I have owned a few mice that were difficult to pry open. This is not the case here. While I'm on the subject of battery, though, I have only owned this for about 3 months. THe longest I've had a mouse last was about 4-6 months on one battery. I can't speak about the 10 month advertised time yet, whether thats realistic or not, but this does, thankfully, have an on/off switch. I find it remarkable the number of wireless mice that don't have this option. Even using this a little will obviously help the battery life.When I bought this, I thought the whole Bluetrack technology thing was just silly. I happened to like the idea, but this is based on a very superficial preference towards blue and away from red. Now I am sure they could have made it whatever color they wanted, more than likely, but what is more important is that the technology actually works. I have used this on bedsheets, both granite and laminate covers, paper, glossy book covers, carpet, wood, and even glass. This has worked perfectly on all of them. Yes, surprisingly, it worked on glass. It wasn't the cleanest glass ever, but it was transparent and it wasn't that dirty. I was amazed. I've had various optical/laser mice before, and they have each failed at one or the other thing, either by not picking up the motion at all or just acting kind of buggy/random. I haven't had this experience yet with this mouse.On the subject of durability, I have dropped this mouse numerous times on carpeted and tiled surfaces. So far it is not showing any signs of my abuse.The last factor people usually use when buying a mouse is the comfort factor. This is probably one of the most subjective things. I have read reviews from people who do not like mice that are symmetrical. I find it funny that they'd write a negative review based on this when they can see from the product that it is symmetrical, but if you like mice that tapered buttons, this is not for you. The mouse is not ergonomically shaped. It does curve inward on the sides, and there is a rubberized surface there, so you get a good grip on it effortlessly. This is a plus in my book. It is not terribly large, and is not diminutive either.I have read other reviews where people have been unhappy with the scroll wheel because it doesn't click. This seems to be pretty common among newer MicroSoft mice. I've actually written a not-so-great review for a mouse based on this functionality, but I feel this mouse pulls it off a lot better. The wheel, like so many other things about this product, moves effortlessly and is not sluggish at all. I don't feel that I have lost any precision. I just feel that it is more effectively executed with this mouse than with others that I have tried.Basically, I think this is a great little product. More than just recommending it to others, I have actually bought additional mice of this kind so that I can use it with other computers I own. I'm voting with my dollar here, and the Mobile Wireless Mouse 6000 is a great little piece of technology.----------Update regarding the battery life: About or 3 weeks after writing this review, the battery died in my mouse. This would seem to confirm the assumption I made in this review that its probably not actually going to last as long as the product placement says under normal circumstances. Now this mouse does have an on/off switch on the bottom. If you actually use this, I'm sure you'd get better time out of each battery. I do sometimes, but I won't pretend like its more than half the time I walk away from the mouse. I'm not at all disappointed by this development--in part because I expected it--and have subsequently purchased another mouse for one of my other computers. I am very happy with this product.", "rating": "pos"}

Another nice touch is that it comes with a tray to allow you to install it in a standard hard drive slot, something other companies might make you buy separately.Why didn't I give it 5 stars?  Well, to be honest, it doesn't really differentiate (to me) from other offerings.  It like the speed, I like the brand, I like the price and the fact that it shipped Prime.

{"title": "Awesome Pocket Camcorder", "body": "I was considering purchasing either this Camileo S20 or the Flip 2nd Gen Brushed Metal model. Obviously I ended up choosing the Camileo S20, and here is why:**I looked at the many reviews of the Flip model, and didn't like what people had to say. Many reviews complained about the bulit-in USB connector not fitting any of their USB ports for uploading or charging to the PC. Eventually Flip finally responded to this major concern, after denying the issue for a long time, leaving their early customers out to dry according to the reviews. Not great customer service in my opinion, and others that had their FLip break down had much trouble with customer service in getting it fixed. Read the reviews for yourself. There are many complaints BEYOND the supposedly resolved USB issue. The Camileo doesn't have many reviews, but the ones it has are good.**Even if the Flip's USB arm is truly fixed, I prefer connecting my camcorder with a USB WIRE. It sounds much better than expecting your Flip to float in the air while connected to your PC. Using a wired connection you can set the Camileo camera in the floor, on top of your PC tower, on your desk, ect.**The Camileo can shoot in 1080p (without zoom or stabilization) or 720p with these features enabled. The Flip max resolution is 720p only. (And now that I have the Camileo for myself, both of the higher resolutions look absolutely brillant in bright outdoor environments. As others have stated, the low-light indoor video looks OK at best. This is how all pocket cams are apparently though, and reviews of the Flip's low light video doesn't sound any better.)**Camileo has a 3-inch LCD screen, the Flip is only 2-inches.**Camileo has a much greater value. As of this review, the Camileo is $50 dollars cheaper than the Flip. The Camileo does not have the built-in 8GB storage like the Flip. Once could buy a 8GB HDCP card for $15 dollars here on Amazon, equaling this Flips spec. Even better, you could expand the storage all the way to 32 GB if you want, while the Flip is locked-in at only 8GB forever. Let's say you buy the 8GB card for the Camileo. You are still saving $35 dollars in comparison, and we haven't even got to the other great things packed in the Camileo box....**Superior Accessories. The Camileo comes packed with an AC adapter, perfect for when you don't want to lug around your computer to charge up the power. The Flip not only does not come with an AC adapter, the official model costs $13 dollars, and multiple reviews of it say it is faulty, and causes the Flip to shut down because of overheating, defeating the point of this accessory altogether. The Camileo also comes with a free tripod. Flip owners have to pony up an extra $9 dollars for one. HDMI cables for direct HDTV viewing? Free with the Camileo, $14 dollars for the Flip. USB cables are also free with the Camileo, and $14 dollars for the Flip if you are like me and don't like the idea of the built-in arm attatchment on the Flip. I am not sure if the Flip comes with a standard AV cord for older TVs, as it isn't a listed accessory, but the Camileo DOES come with one free as well. You also get a free travel case with the Camileo, the FLip cases start at $7 dollars and up. Doing the math, the Flip costs $86 dollars more, and you are still stuck with a faulty AC adapter and may not even have standard AV cables.**I cannot speak to the video files on the Flip, but the Camileo videos save to the PC in AVI files, which can be edited either with the included software, or better yet, Windows Movie Maker easily and immediately after upload with no conversion needed. Maybe the Flip does too, I don't know. Both have instant Youtube uploads, so that one is a wash.**CONCLUSION: The Camileo has better specs with the larger LCD screen, and higher 1080P video resolution.The Camileo is $86 dollars cheaper after considering the need to purchase an 8GB card for Camileo and purchasing a boatload of accessories for Flip.Camileo can be expanded to 32GB, the Flip is locked in at 8GB. The Camileo USB connection is superior and more accessible than the FLip IMO. Flip has a spotty customer service department, Toshiba has always been good to me in the past, and I haven't even needed them with the Camileo. This Camileo model does not have the massive advertising campaign that the Flip does, so Toshiba is able to pass the saving on to consumers. Flip might have the \"coolness\" factor due to being all over television, but I would rather have a superior camera at a cheaper cost, so I went with the Camileo.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Fantastic", "body": "Metra 95-7320 Double DIN Installation Dash Kit for 2006-2008 Hyundai Sonata (Black) fits fantastic in my 2008 Hyundai Sonata. I gave it 4 stars because it only comes in black and I have a blue dash. But I'm changing out the side fascia panels with hazard switch to black panels also (ordered from Hyundai).I paired this with the Pioneer AVH-P3200BT stereo. One thing people should be aware of....but not the fault of Metra:Once you remove the original factory unit you will see a flange sticking up from the floor of the radio compartment. If like me you just put in the new stereo along with the metra 7320 you may find there is a big gap where the top of the metra face plate meets the dash....NOT A PROBLEM because - That metal flange sticking up from the radio compartment has two divots for the placement of a screw drive....place a big screw driver in the divot and hit the top of the screw driver with your palm and the metal will bend down. Keep knocking it down until your stereo with faceplate fits like a glove. The metal flange is made to bend and allow the stereo bottom to rest against it.The metra faceplate looks really, really good...I would highly recommend it if you want to replace your factory installed stereo unit.One additional thing - the metra directions have a wire color and function code for the wiring of the hyundai wiring harness....wire coloring listed was wrong! So don't rely on the metra directions for the wire info. Instead, go to [...](Hyundai online shop/electrical/parts manual provided by hyundai to hyundai owners). You can get all the information you need from that site....very extensive. Basically the entire repair manual online.Best of luck all!", "rating": "pos"}

I have taken about 300 pictures with it so far and have found it to be a terrific lens.  It is very solidly built and doesn't slip, as some zooms do, when aimed down at a subject.  The manual focus feature is good, especially if you have your camera on a tripod.  At the telephoto focal lengths manual focusing can be a bit dauting, but it works (it automatically enlarges a portion of the image for you to focus on, then returns to your picture as zoomed).  Image Stabilization is built in the lens and seems very good. I am amazed at the lower shutter speeds I can use and still get a sharp image.  I know this lens will provide me with a lot of picture taking fun for years to come.

My bad sorry, but I did purcase this card as you can see with the verified purchaser tag.I have an Nikon D90. I purchased the 8G San Disc Extreme III card 30MB/S and a Transcend 16G class 6 card at the same time. The San Disc Extreme 3 card is incredibly fast. I get 100 pictures (4.5 frames per second) at fine resolution before the camera stops to buffer in 24 seconds. The Transcend card gets 17 photos on the same settings then pauses to buffer. If you have the camera that can take full advantage of this write speed this fast card is worth the investment. No more cringing while I wait for my camera to clear its buffer so I can take more pictures.I like to shoot at 4.5 frames. It gives me a lot to pick through when I edit, but a lot can happen in a fraction of a second that can make a photo good or bad. Having the capability to hold down the shutter release and rattle off large bursts of photos is important to me.I have found that 8G is a good size for SLR Photography. In my opinion bigger cards are putting a lot of eggs in one basket.I posted a video test demonstrating this products incredible write speed.  You can find it by clicking on my name and searching for this product.  I'd repost it here but I deleted from my computer.I have been using the card for several months.  I have about 10 different cards that I use and I can honestly say that this is my favorite.

{"title": "Almost perfect... 4-1/2 stars", "body": "The big problem with using LED lights for photo and video work is color fidelity.  Almost all of them have some sort of nasty color cast that remains on the image after it has been color corrected.  This is due to the non-linearity in which it emits its color spectrum.  This &#34;quality&#34; of light is reflected in the CRI - or &#34;color rendering index&#34;.  Sunlight is a perfect 100, and most other forms of light are lower than this.  Any LED light which does not advertise a CRI is probably a pretty bad light, so buyer beware.  This light claims a CRI of over 92, which is impressively good.A few years back I bought a $40 LED light here off Amazon and it was just terrible.  It left a nasty green cast to the images which made them only good for black and white. I literally used it once, then sold it - swearing off LED lights for serious photo work for nearly three years.  Since then I've been using incandescent video lights for low-light photo work and have generally been happy.  The issue with these, however, is that they are limited in output, have a fixed color temperature, and are power hungry.  They were relatively inexpensive, very portable, and had decent (but not perfect) color - so they were good enough.With the impressive specs of this light, I decided to venture back into LED lighting.  After a couple wedding shoots with this, I am impressed with the light.  They get fairly bright, use very little power, and have lots of great features such as a dimmer, color temperature variability (3200k to 5600k), and battery meter (YES! Finally).I am also happy to report that unlike cheap LED lights of yesteryear, these have decent color.  After some investigation, I suspect the &#62;92 CRI rating is for the 5600k setting, not the 3200k setting, though.  The color quality at 5600k seems to be quite good, while I can report a noticeable - though not terrible - red color cast at the 3200k setting.  Keep in mind that this is going to result in a green tint to the backgrounds when color correcting this light at 3200k.  Depending on the nature of what you photography, this might or might not be an issue for you.  For me, it's not ideal, but not a deal-breaker either.Given the features, versatility, and quality of the light, I'm willing to let the slight red cast at 3200k slide with a 1/2 star deduction.  I'm definitely keeping the light and even thinking about picking up another one.  For me, this light is a game-changer for low-light events and portraiture.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Nice Video Recorder", "body": "I recently purchased the Philips Hard Disk/DVD Recorder with a 160 gig hard drive, model DVDR3576H/37. The unit performs well and the convenience of the hard drive is really nice. This enables someone to record to the hard drive and then record from the hard drive to a DVD if so desired. You can also record directly to a DVD if you want. The DVDs are upgraded giving a great picture. There is no Blueray, but personally I am not interested in that right now. I have my television hooked up through a cable system so the big complaint I have really has nothing to do with the Philips unit. I can not use the timed recording function because the unit has to be kept on the same channel all the time and the cable box is used to change the channels. Therefore you can only record whatever comes on the channel you have the box set to. Aside from this annoyance that someone not using a set top box would not have, I love the unit. I use the cable guide to decide what I am going to record.Ken McCormickWebmasterAbout Facts Net", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Nice and Simple!", "body": "OK, here are the facts: my other (similar) camera developed a glitch -- it will not allow me to delete photos without loooooong delays. So I went in search of an inexpensive replacement camera. I settled on this Canon.I did so with trepidation because some of the reviews were lukewarm at best. Yet other reviewers loved it. (This, by the way, is what makes horse races!) So I thought I would take a chance.Here is why I am happy with my choice: (1) the viewer seems larger than its dimensions suggest; (2) the camera fits in my shirt pocket; (3) the pics are crisp indoors and out; (4) the on-off button is clearly marked and the shot button is nice and robust. For me, these features are all I need. To be sure, the camera has a few video bells and whistles -- I'll try those one of these days. No rush.A Con: the shot button takes a little getting used to, since it appears to have two stages to it. If you just press and disengage, nothing will happen. It requires a little patience and then it will take the picture. I can live with that idiosyncrasy.Another Con: no internal memory. You must purchase an SD card before you can use the camera. This too I have accepted, because having pics on cards does make it easy to load them into PCs and laptops.If you are looking for a simple \"point-and-shoot\" camera that will also perform other tricks if you are of a mind, go for it!", "rating": "pos"}

I had used a different model from this company for a HTC Flyer tablet I had previously, so when I bought my new tablet, I went with this.  Delivery from Amazon was quick.The BlackBerry PlayBook easily clips into this case.  It has two grooves in the lid so that you can use it as a stand for your tablet also.  The quality is good and the stitching looks professional.  I have to admit that this is a very good looking case and so much cheaper than the official cases from BlackBerry.  It's very slim and when it's closed, I could still place my PlayBook in my pocket.  Also being able to use it as a stand is a added feature.  One of the primary reasons I had bought a PlayBook was to watch movies and this makes it easy for you.  There are cutouts on this case so that you can get access to your ports even when the case is closed.  You can plug in your your charger, but you can't place this in that Quick Charge stand while it's still in the case.  So if you want to use a Quick Charger, choose the one with the cord that you can connect to the three pronged charge port instead of that stand unit.Unfortunately, the PlayBook I purchased had a battery problem. I could not get the device to charge.  After searching around on the net and trying all the tips like doing a \"stacked charge\", I decided to get rid of my PlayBook when I could not get it to work.However, I do recommend this case for anyone looking for a slim case for their BlackBerry PlayBook.

{"title": "Best screen protector I have every used!", "body": "I have had 10-12 touch screen devices, including older Palms, etc., that use a hard stylus.  I have always put on a screen protector as soon as I could get my hands on one.  This is probably the best I have every used.I like the fact that it is not cut EXACTLY to fit.  An EXACT fit sounds like a great idea and to some may suggest better quality, but in practice it makes it EXTREMELY tedious to get it applied without an edge somewhere not quite aligned and therefore lifted slightly from the screen surface.  This HHI seems to be about a millimeter or so smaller in length and width which makes no difference in the protection, but allows that TINY bit of misalignment and still lay flat with full contact on the screen.  Either that or I got it perfectly aligned after just two or three tries this time.  I usually quit after about three tries because the protectors start to collect dust or kinks.This protector installed as easily as any have used.  I have developed a technique that seems to work for me.  I peel the first protective layer back enough to get one corner aligned and started then start slowly peeling the protector back while sliding my finger back and forth to gradually press down the part of the protector that is coming in contact with the screen.  This way I am trying to make sure no bubbles form.  If a bubble does form it is easy to back up a bit and re-apply that part.  Sometimes I get half way and realize my alignment is not quite right so I back up and try again.  The protective film over the adhesive side of most protectors is usually stiff enough that it wants to spring back into place over the protector so backing is pretty easy.  I had to re-start three times, but I got it down with only one stubborn tiny bubble.  It is close enough to a corner that I could probably lift the corner and get rid of it, but I also might introduce more.  It is completely away from the work area so I have not even noticed it.  Oh, if you ever do need to lift a corner of a screen protector after it is down, just stick a piece of regular office tap to the corner to make a little tab.  Works great.The anti-glare feature of this protector is fantastic.  It is as if there is nothing there.  It is not overly aggressive the way some are with some kind of hatching pattern that winds up looking grainy.  It seems just slightly frosted.  It is also either very thin or designed to be sensitive because it doesn't seem to have affected touchscreen sensitivity at all.  I am able to use both a regular rubber-tipped capacitive stylus and one of the Adonit Jot styli available here on Amazon.  Even the little stylus that came free with the screen protector worked fine, but not as well as the better ones I have.I highly recommend this Handheld Items screen protector.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Works with Yamaha Clavinova CVP-509", "body": "The TRENDnet Wireless N Gaming Adapter TEW-647GA allows you to connect devices with an ethernet plug to a wireless connection on your own wireless network or wireless internet router/modem.  Typically, this is not used for laptops or desktops (for which you would use a USB or other wireless adapter that you can configure from the laptop/desktop).  Instead it is used to connect \"dumb\" devices, like some game systems, other hardware, or in my case, a Yamaha CVP-509 digital piano.Because \"dumb\" devices don't have a way to configure a wireless connection, you first have to set up the TRENDnet Wireless N Gaming Adapter TEW-647GA on your desktop or laptop using the downloadable or CD-ROM based configurator wizard.  A warning to Windows users: when you first run the wizard, some Windows configurations will pop up a warning that asks how you would like the wizard to connect to the network.  If you do not choose the least restrictive option, you will be unable to configure the adapter.  The configurator will lead you through several steps.  The exact series will depend on how you want to connect to your network.  After it has finished configuring the adapter, it will instruct you to unplug the adapter from the desktop or laptop and plug it into the \"dumb\" device.  If you were successful, your device will now be connected to the internet, so that you can download games or connect to other players online (or, so that you can download music, piano radio, or piano lessons as in my case).I had some problems in getting the configurator to work.  Each time, the configuration failed, without any advice on how to fix it.

{"title": "Great Alternative To Toshiba Replacement Part", "body": "After having my Toshiba laptop for two years, the power cord started to malfunction. I think the issue was the point where the cord plugs into the laptop. That connection seemed to be loose to me. I couldn't believe that thing only lasted two years. I only use my laptop at home, and ninety percent of the time its just used in one room of my house, so it doesn't get moved around much. I went online to Toshiba and this part was going to cost me $70 plus! Then I started reading horror stories of other Toshiba owners, who while happy with their laptops, HATED the original power cord/adapter. Some were on their FIFTH replacement! The Toshiba power cord/adapter received horrible reviews and I decided no way was I going to purchase one, just to have it break down in another year or two. This adapter is a blessing and the price point is fantastic. It even has a blue indicator light on the adapter so you know that it is plugged in and charging. The section of the cord that plugs into the laptop is shaped like an L, and it swivels so when you change positions or move the laptop, the cord just rotates. The original Toshiba adapter was a straight plug, it had no curve, so when you moved the laptop, the cord would get caught or just come unplugged. The only reason I didn't give this particular product five stars is the cord that goes from the laptop to the adapter needs to be somewhat longer. The cord that goes from the adapter to the wall is fine in length though.

I tested with Speed Test before and after the swap and I see virtually no difference whatsoever.  I was getting around 21 Mbps down and 4 Mbps up before and after. I was using a Motorola SB5120 and thought the newer technology in the device and firmware might boost it a bit, as others have experienced by the reviews.  I can tell you that I have not seen it. I guess Comcast has it clamped pretty good. Am I upset? No, it won't be the first time I threw money at my computer for little to no improvement.

{"title": "Much easier, cheaper and more options than the apple tv", "body": "Chances are you want this to save money, such as in place of cable or paying to rent TV shows. If so, this really is the cheapest and easiest option. I have an Apple TV which I am going to sell now, as this is much easier to use and has more to offer. Hulu, Crackle, Amazon, and Netflix are the big 4 I think all of these TV boxes should offer, Apple TV only does Netflix as of right now. The Pandora access is nice to as it integrates with your online .account. I really liked being able to buy an iPhone app to control this via my phone, a nice option in case you misplace the remote. Also, it is nice to be able to add channels online and they will magically appear on your device. Updates are automatic, too. Can't wait to see what other things are released.I went with the cheapest one as my internet is not fast enough to be really playing 1080p and I doubt more free services are offering that much streaming in 1080p, I'm just happy to get free TV and movies.

The accessories that come with it was average because I had bought other headphones before and those came with a richer set of accessories.

It was slightly above average and the bass could be further improved. There was no noise isolation and hence one had to pump up the volume to achieve the same isolation from outside world noises. Nevertheless, it was a value for money at this price range (I paid about $60) and hence I would still recommend this to others.The negative side has to be the headband. Anything running across the headband would carry the sound to the buds and hence it was not recommended for listening while lying on the bed. Dun say I never warn you!

{"title": "Very nice for AVCHD DVD-R video creation. Simple and fast.", "body": "Got it for my father (78) who does not have a computer and likes a lot quality of video of my Sony CX100 AVCHD camcorder. Very soon this camcorder will be his... (I'm thinking about upgrade) For him this is the simplest way to get AVCHD disks playable on his Sony S360 blue ray player. MC6 looks like great investment!Makes AVCHD disk with one push of the button![Turn it ON, insert blank DVD-R, Push that big button (make sure you are recording in AVCHD!) -- that's it!]My observations:1. Default settings 'out of the box' are the highest quality for AVCHD. This is great news, nothing to adjust!2. It will record ONLY directly from the camera/camcorder, OR - memory card taken straight out of the camera/camcorder (if you were recoding your video's on flash card, instead of internal memory). I tried to copy video's files from my computer to Memory Stick Pro and make a disk - it did not worked. So this device is not THAT flexible. Please keep this in mind, if you want to be \"creative\".  :)3. This thing will NOT copy disk it just created. So, if you need more than one disk, keep camcorder connected and make several disks while still connected to recorder. That's, I think is odd... why this device not capable to make copies/duplicates of it's own disks? Sure, on any computer you can easily make as many copies of these disks to pass your vacation video to your friends. But for people without computer - what they should do? I think, this is pretty big bu-bu made by Sony... and you need to be aware of it. It introduces some inconveniences, but it is not fatal for this device. This thing still delivering great quality.Giving 4 stars for this blah... Sony, are you listening? Fix it now!4. Yes, AVCHD disks with HD video are played ONLY on Blue Ray players. Whattt? you don't have one? So, buy it! You will be happy (Check out [...], you can get  it for ~125 or less [Sony BDPS360]), you will be VERY happy. It will upgrade video playback of your existing analog DVD's too. Just please, connect it to your 1080 HDTV by HDMI cable. Do NOT use any other cables...Yeah, I guess, I would buy it again. There is virtually, no other device like this on the market. On second thought, how about adding 300 bucks more and get my father simple desktop/laptop, then teach him how to use Sony PMB software for CX100 camcorder. :)PS: I only care about creation of AVCHD disks.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "It works, its good.", "body": "Just got it, some observations:1. They are quite comfortable, thats the first thing you notice. There are little soft rubber boots you slip onto the part that goes into the ear canal (it goes in just slightly). The boots come in 3 sizes and you can choose whats good for you.2. There are 2 reasons why the bass is boosted, as others have noted. a) It goes into your ear canal by a quarter inch or so, unlike other earbuds. If they slip out of your ear canal a bit, the bass noticably goes down. To get the full bass boost effect, you need to pick the rubber boot size that keeps them firmly in your ear. b) The second reason the bass is boosted, is because the rubber boot has a partial noise-reducing isolating effect (you can still hear outside noises, but it cuts it out more than normal earbuds).3. Overall the sound is good, not tinny, the highs arent too shrill as in normal earbuds, there is a nice 'balance' to the sound. That actually took some getting used to, since I was mostly used to the tinnier, shriller earbuds that one usually gets with mp3 players. After a while tho i appreciated the difference, and I think I had less 'listening fatigue' too while listening for long periods of time.4. Now some caveats. First off, if your ear canal is full of wax, you'll find the earbuds have a tendency to slip out over time. That'll teach you not to clean your ears.5. If you dont stick them in all the way, you lose the bass boost effect and its advantages.6. If you pick the rubber boot that gives a tight fit in your ear canal, you may experience a 'ear pop' effect when you initially first stick them in your ear. Its not exactly pleasant. Sometimes my eyes water when i do it too fast. Its only at the very beginning tho; the air pressure in your ear equalizes after a moment. (Thank goodness for the eustacian tube). (look it up).7. If you pick the smaller size rubber boot to minimize that air pressure effect, then over time they tend to slip out of your ear. (I opted for this rather cuz i really dont like that air pressure feeling in my ear). So I periodically have to adjust them to get the best sound by squishing them back into my ear after they've slipped out. No biggie tho, the comfort and sound quality make up for that.8. Lastly, note that CNET reviewed these as being almost on par with earbuds costing 4 times as much. Also, note that the LP designation in the name indicates a long 4 foot cord (the other designation, the S or SL, indicates the shorter 1.5 foot cord which most reviewers found too short and had to use an extension.) Note lastly, that this model has one earbud on a shorter cord than the other (so it hangs off to one side next to your shoulder rather than coming down the middle of your body). Some people dont like this. Supposedly Sony has this pair of earbuds with that other, middle-of-body style cord (and it also comes in two cord lengths, 1.5 and 4 foot). I actually thought i was ordering the middle-of-body version, but I got the side-of-body version. Whatever, i'm not going to go thru the trouble of exchanging it, since I think its good enough, but basically be careful what you order if those differences mean a lot to you!In sum: They beat regular earbuds by allowing you to listen to music for long periods of time without discomfort, and by boosting bass levels. Be careful of cord arrangement (side body or middle body; and cord length) confusions that Sony unfortunately created with this otherwise excellent set of earbuds. And clean up that earwax in your ear.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Great Cans/marrage savers", "body": "I recently purchased the sennheiser 130 model. Let me first start by saying that I am 46 years old and suffer from tinnitus in both ears. In my case my Tinnitus is accompanied by hearing loss. The reason I wanted a set of wireless headphones is that I did not want to disturb my wife in the early morning or if I am up late watching TV. I wanted wireless because I didn't want a cord of 25-50 feet and wanted the freedom to move around the apartment (this ruled all line of sight headsets out). I read all the reviews on this unit as well as the 140's and I was also considering the AR (acoustic research) model as well. In fact a few years ago I bought the AR's from Best Buy for my mother in law who as far as I know enjoys them. You may be asking why if I bought my mother in law the Ar's (acoustic research) why I didn't buy those for myself?  The current reviews on those headphones were not that positive and there seems to be a lot of issues with the charging of the batteries. One review I read somewhere even said the headset melted in the charging cradle!After I purchased the 130's from Amazon I did have a bit of buyers remorse because I felt because of my hearing loss maybe I should have bought the 140s. The reason I bought the 130's over the 140's was price. I had some gift certificates and I really didn't want to spend a lot on a set of headphones. With my gift certificates the cost for the 130's came out to be $30 bucks versus $89 if I bought the 140s. I felt if I really didn't like them I could always try to return them (see return section of my review)Open ear design:Let me first discuss the open ear design, you will either like it or hate it no real in betweens here. With the open ear system other people can hear what you are listening to especially if it is set loud, which depending on your hearing loss may or may not be an issue. It may also be a distraction for others in the room if they need complete quite to read and you are listing to them really loud.  For me it really isn't since most of the time no one is in the room when I am using them. I was able to hear my wife in the kitchen one evening washing dishes and talking on the phone, so it doesn't block out background noise, if that is an issue to you then consider the 140's. Even with a closed system I don't know how much noise it will really block (dogs barking, fire trucks, neighbors, dishes, kids playing, etc). I think you would really need noise canceling headphones for that which I don't believe the 140's are.Set up:Very easy to set up. First you charge it up for 16 hours as instructed in the manual and then connected the audio connections and hook the power up to the power strip. I have the audio connected via my cable box rather then the TV connections. The reason I did this was some people had said that if they have it connected to the TV and turn on the headphones the TV volume turns off. I haven't tried it the other way yet to find out if this is true. The written Manuel is very poor and frankly not worth the paper it is written on. My only complaint about the base unit is I wish that it had an on off switch for the base unit power. This way I could keep the unit off and not continue to charge the headset after it has a full charge. The unit will continue to charge when the headset is placed on top of the base and it has power.  I would rather have it discharge fully before recharging.Sound:I think the sound quality is very good, some people say in their reviews that the surround sound feature doesn't work. I tried it and when watching a TV show I could hear dialog in one of the ears and the street noise of the scene in the other so I think it does work. If you have the 140's there is also supposed to be a dialog enhancer and you can control the level of each the volume on each side of the headset, which if the price was lower on the 140's would make it much more worth while for me. Also. I read one review that said the 130's sound was \"muddied\" I really didn't find the sound to be bad at all, in fact I heard some things in the background that I would have missed if I wasn't using headphones, but with a closed system like the 140's you will probably get a deeper sound.  Even without the dialog enhancer I have not had a problem hearing the dialog in a movie, at times you might have to turn the volume up but it really hasn't been an issue for me.I have even used these when my wife and I were both watching TV. My wife likes to watch at low volume (she doesn't have a hearing loss problem) and I had the headset on. I don't recommend this because to me it sounded like you are in a tunnel since you hear the sound in the headset as well as through the headset. If you are buying these with that function in mind you might be better off with a closed system like the 140's.HissI have it hooked up to my cable box audio connections and I really have not noticed any hiss, I did notice some distortion one day but I just changed the channel on the headset and that cleared it up. But again please remember I have a hearing loss and tinnitus, so I constantly have a ringing in my ears.RangeI live in an apartment it close to 1,000 square feet.  I can go anywhere in my apartment with the headset on with no problem. I have also walked out of my unit to the laundry room down the hall and again no distortion in the sound.ComfortI have no complaints they are very comfortable. I have no problem keeping these things on for a couple of hours while I watch a show or movie.  Some people have also complained about the switch locations being in the back. I agree with that complaint. This is an awkward location, it would have been better if these were on the sides of the headphones or the front, but when I leaned back in my recliner it hasn't turned off the set yet or changed the volume but I can see this happening. I just tilt the headset a bit so that these controls are not hitting the back of the pillow. I think it really is the only downside to these headphones but it's no different on the 140's.Return policyIt seems most of these units are not sold by Amazon directly, so read the return policy carefully before you buy.

{"title": "You get a lot", "body": "For someone with little experience buying these, you get a lot for what you pay for.  You get the kitchen sink basically.  The only weakness, in my experience, is that the search database is limited, like you can't search for businesses out the database which is limited to shopping, fuel, logding and that stuff.  Like a lot of things, it won't know what you're talking about, like the IRS locations for tax returns.  So.. just don't think it knows where everything is, IT IS NOT LIKE GOOGLE.  You have to use your internet at home and write down an address you are trying to get to, then type in the address or crossstreets to the device.Gripe aside, this one of the most amazing inventions.  Switching from a stupid iphone which cost a fortune to this little machine and it's one time cost has been amazing, like life became easier.

{"title": "Great Speakers", "body": "I have these speakers hooked up to my Samsung Smart TV.I'm happy with them.I imagined them being full of water with streams of bubbles colored by lights.  However, the clear plastic part on top is empty and when the music/sound plays jets of water shoot up illuminated by colored LEDs.  It's nice and I like it.  It's just different from what I imagined.Like most sound activated devices the jets of water are in relation to the level of sound or the change in the level of sound.My speakers are being powered off one of the USB ports on my TV.  When I turn the TV off the speakers go off -- nice.  In order to put the speakers on the fireplace I had to use a USB extension/repeater (Alfa USB 2.0 Active Extension Cable - Repeater Cable - High Speed 480Mbps - A Male to A Female - 10 Meters / 32.8 feet Long) which works fine.  I noticed no different in performance when I used it.One speakers has a green tint to the light and the other had a blue tint.  If I have the TV on and no sound is coming out when you look at the ceiling you can see the green light from one and the blue light from the other.My one complaint which really has NOTHING to do with the speakers is that the audio output from my TV is at a fixed level.  So if I'm listening to Pandora on my TV (which for some reason is insanely loud) and I turn the TV down (usually almost all the way) there is still allot of sound coming out of these speakers and in my configuration, I have no way to turn it down.I notice similar speakers for $29 (Wet Wild Water Show SpeakersI tried to put the \"Insert a product link\" and it's not working.

{"title": "Good for what it's good for", "body": "Make sure you know why you are buying this device. The stand built into the tablet makes this the most convenient media consumption device on the market, hands down. It is incredibly easy to adjust the tablet to the viewing angle you desire. You don't need to mess with a kickstand, or put it in a folio case to get the thing to stand securely in landscape mode for watching video, or in &#34;keyboard&#34; mode for email and other text intensive tasks. The design is awesome. In addition, the battery life is epic. It lasts forever. I've dispensed with any kind of battery saving settings on the tablet because these are never necessary. I have a very long inactivity time-out, and I keep the screen at max brightness. I never turn off Bluetooth or WiFi or any other battery sucking component. There's no need. The battery on this thing is peerless. So, if you're looking for a media consumption device for watching movies, playing music, reading, surfing, light gaming, etc., then pull the trigger now. This is the best device at the best price for those kinds of activities. Some people have criticized the 1280x800 resolution on this tablet because it isn't full 1080p. I don't have any problem with the screen. I think it looks terrific and the resolution is plenty high for a tablet this size. Viewing angles and colors are very good. It is bright and sharp.Others have griped about the processor, which admittedly isn't state of the art. However, it does a fine job streaming hi-res video, which is the reason you want to buy this device. If you want to play the most demanding games, you'll need something with the latest and greatest processor. Of course, you'll be paying for that.Nevertheless, there are cons. While the battery lasts forever, it also takes forever to charge. But the worst thing is the HORRIBLE Android skin that Lenovo is using for this thing. It does not use an app drawer, and instead icons are lined up &#34;iPad&#34; style in a grid on the various home screens. Organizing them around is a pain in the butt and if you have a lot of apps, prepare to do a lot of hunting for the ones you need. I'm pretty sure the idea here was to mimic the iPad, but it is easily the worst Android launcher I've ever seen. Yuck.Still ... I'm glad I bought it and I would buy it again. Just keep in mind, if the battery life and stand aren't the reasons you're looking into this device, then buy something else.", "rating": "pos"}

I have no problem with the velcro on my SB-600 or SB-900 flashes like some others do (no idea why that bothers some people; it looks fine and works perfectly), and the softbox stays on well. I do use a thick elastic band that came with a Gary Fong diffuser to help hold the softbox tightly on the velcro just to keep it from shifting, since the softbox is a little heavy for the velcro and tugs on the attachment points a little. Light is diffused very well. I use it mainly with D7oo, SB-900 flash, and a stroboframe flash bracket. Portraits turn out nice when used this way, and the set-up is reasonably portable.

They worked just as well on my iPod Classic, my Kindle Fire, my Dell Desktop PC (Windows 7) and with my laptop which is a HP Pavillion DV900 entertainment laptop.  At school, I did use them on an iMac editing bay and again, they work equally well.Since I edit film as part of my work, and because sound is one of the major components of any media piece, especially in film, I tend to be extremely picky about sound quality for my headsets. In both Final Cut 7 and in Adobe Premiere Pro 7 and using a Mac, I did not find the bass strong enough on these earbuds to suit me.  I don't believe it was intended to be used in such a situation, either. That is the only reason I held back on the extra star. Otherwise,  I have used similarly priced Skull Candy headsets and found them very \"tinny\" by comparison to this set by Maxell.

In fact, that's with the legs up and laid flat it is only 0.64\" thick, so that was a pleasant surprise.As for it's feel, it feels very similar to a high end laptop keyboard.  The keys are similarly shaped with a narrow depth.  The throw is similar too.  But of course, it has the full compliment of keys that a full keyboard has.  I find the combination of the nice laptop feel and the full layout to be very nice.Since I type on a laptop keyboard a lot, it feels very natural and I won't deal with the slight typing speed losses of transitioning between one and the other.

But it is a less efficient design, meaning that the card temps tend to be a little higher, and it is also a fairly noisy design.This dual fan design, on the other hand, is more efficient and quieter, with the downside that overall case temps can be a little higher. If your cpu is well cooled, and you have good ventilation in your build, that is an easy choice to make!I put this card on a mini-itx motherboard, so there is only room for one graphics card.

{"title": "Logitech Gaming Keyboard G510", "body": "Just got this in the mail and been waiting, albeit a couple of days, seemed like an eternity...Amazing keyboard -- some might say, either thee, or one of the, best keyboards on the market!!! I have used Logitech numerous times in the past, and never had any problems with Logitech as I have with Microsoft products...I have had Logitech Wave (USB Wired), S510 (Wireless Mouse-Keyboard Combo), Logitech MX3000 (Wireless Keyboard-Mouse Combo), etc, and some others...With the G15, 1st and 2nd Version's, now obsolete and no longer in production: I was contemplating for literally a month between this (G510) for $95, or the [MX5500 Revolution] for $135...Since I wanted to purchase a separate 'non-Logitech' mouse @ the [Cobra E-3lue High Precision Gaming Mouse with Side Control 1600dpi]: I then went with this -- and am glad I did!!! I have literally owned about 30+ keyboards now from many manufacturers, both gaming and multi-media, over the past 8-10 years...This is about my 5th keyboard purchased in the last 2 months, alone...However, this is my first time owning a keyboard like this from Logitech... So I cannot give you any information/specs/stats, and personal experience with the previous two @ G15's, that this replaced...And I am not a gamer into gaming, except for a few games here-and-there that I play on single-player campaign...That is to say, that I am not into the whole LAN online multi-player server-network gaming... So therefor again, I cannot also give you any personal-experience and data/info into the matters at hand for that...That being said... The Keyboard itself is superb!!! The only thing keeping this from being \"Flawless\", is the fact that there is no way to adjust the brightness of the Illuminated LED back-lit colors physically on the keyboard, but only through Logitech's software manual color-pallet/profiling/selecting...and when you use Logitech's built-in color-profile software, to set your own keyboard LED back-light coloring and brightness -- the keyboard doesn't/won't recognize the colors you manually set through the color-profile software, and puts the keyboard back-light to \"White\" or shuts off lighting altogether...This happens when You/I try changing colors other than the listed 16 automatic/standard colors given/listed...There is 16 auto-standard color palettes to choose from, and those like @ Blue, Purple, etc, don't appear the color they're supposed to be -- but near \"White\" as well...One of the major factors that drew me to this keyboard was -- was the backlighting...Not having the colors to work properly as they should, and listed, is upsetting: but then again, maybe I am missing something, since this is my first time!?The Keyboard comes packaged with the Install CD [Always Update via Website, but nice to have in case you don't have Internet access and something happens, etc, and you need to uninstall-reinstall, etc!]..As well, as the palm-wrest [another critical feature/must-have for me that drew me to this keyboard, because of problems with my nerve-damage/muscle-spasms, etc!]...And then the keyboard itself...The keyboard is your basic keyboard, constructed for gamers with Macro keys...This is not specifically a \"Multi-Media\" defined/built keyboard...You do however, have your media controls such as @ Volume, Play-Pause, Stop, Backward-Forwards, Mute, etc...You have your @ ON-Off switch for the backlighting... You have your @ LCD command screen with menu controls/buttons...You have your @ headset mic-speaker ports with mute/on-off buttons...You have your @ joystick slide button; of which enables you to switch between using your keyboard, or that of a car-wheel, flight-control stick, game controller, etc, at any given time...You have your 3 @ instant switchable profile (M) buttons; and your @ 18 Macro programmable (G) keys; of which can instantly be programmed using the @ (MR) button... Then of course -- you also have your normal standard keyboard keys...The palm-wrest is removable if one wishes too not use it, which is a nice feature to have for whatever reason [i.e. space-conservation, bothers your hands, etc]... And what I do like most since I am not into gaming and a gamer, and will not be using the (G) macro keys for gaming reasons: is that Logitech's software lets you program the (G) keys for your personal programs/software -- such as your Internet, Email, Messenger, Photshop, etc, or whatever you favorite and use regularly...So why this is not particularly a @ \"Multi-Media\" keyboard -- you do get the option, if not using this for Gaming purposes, of turning this keyboard for multi-media purposes with the (G) keys...This is what I'll be personally doing!!!Also, unlike (some) or (most) keyboards, of which uses (single) or (multiple) LED's underneath the keyboard layout similar to how a lamp works, to try and give light by poking up the light through the crevices in-between the keys and actually don't light-up the keys themselves to see what you're doing: this keyboard's keys actually have separate LED's underneath every key/button that light up the keys -- so you can actually see the letter's, etc...The keys are simply plastic clear see-through Acrylic, coated with a Black paint/finish, except for the lettering/symbols which are left clear/see-through...This keyboard, in my opinion, is one of the best on the market!!! Even with the palm-rest used: it's still compact enough as not to take up hardly any room and interfere with stuff around you...It's also as \"Slim\" as one could get with such a keyboard, of which is about the thickness of a mere writing-pad/book for school...The keyboard itself is simplistic; and albeit may seem complicated too some -- it really isn't...I mastered the keyboard features/menus/buttons and software almost instantly, and this from a first-time user of it...Whether you're a hardcore gamer, or someone who just wants a stylish keyboard to (s)punk-up your PC/Desktop or Laptop, like me -- than this is the one for you... There is some keyboards out there, that some would say are probably better, more stylish, and has more features/keys, etc, but this is all I will need and ever use is on this keyboard...The keyboard is of excellent quality all around; outside the bottom legs/pegs/feet for support of which could be better quality and designed; and one has to be careful as not to put heavy pressure on the keyboard with the legs/feet/pegs extended...Other than that??? It's a keyboard, and does what's supposed to do...This is used on a Vista X64 Home Premium OS-OEM, and installed instantly...It's 'Plug and Play' out of the box, that is to say: \"plug it into the machine, and you're ready to go\"...So you don't technically need to install drivers -- unless you want to use its features for backlighting, key-programming, etc...The keyboard is easy to use, easy to read, etc...However, if you're like me and not fully used to it, since it's a new keyboard and design/set-up/lay-out, then it'll take time for your hands to adjust to this layout/design, and remember where the keys are, etc, as such when you're typing...All-and-All??? I love it, and will be my keyboard for long periods of time to come...This replaces my new(er) recent gaming-illuminated @ (Microsoft Reclusa),(Blue - Apevia Aspire Multimedia),(Microsoft Wireless Natural Ergonomic 7000), and vast array of others, keyboards...Well worth the price!!!Pro's)+ Sleek and Slim Design+ Lightweight+ Excellent Quality+ Easy to Operate+ No Physical Defects+ Removable Palm-Rest+ Multi-Color Illumination+ Programmable, Profile Switchable, etc+ Able to Turn Off LED Lighting+ Nice LED back-light readable Screen+ Volume, Play-Pause, Stop, Mute, Backwards/Forwards (and-or) Next-Song/Previous-Song+ Mic-Speaker ports for Gaming, VOIP, Skype, Dragon Talk to Text, etc, headsets+ Compact+ The Features, and Quantity-Quality There-of+ Price$Con's)- Bottom support feet/pegs/legs could use better designing and quality- LED's don't work [i.e. change/recognize-colors] like they should, when manually adjusting the color-palletes and turns white when not using the standard pre-set of automated selected/given colors, and claim [But I might also be missing something!]I still it give it 5 Stars...UPDATE!!! NEW UPDATE!!! I have found the reason why my LED color's were not working, lol, and learned how to properly change the colors and get them all to work...You have to simply restart your computer, lol, after each profile change -- should've thought of that in the first place, ahahaha...Once you restart your PC, it's all good to go and the colors work, according to which (M) profile you have chosen your color to be on... The colors are amazing!!! The LED colors, are nice and vibrant and definitely visible -- and literally light-up my desk in the dark...I Repeat!!! The manual selected colors do work, with simple restart, and can be dimmed or brightened with the software!!! The LCD screen, also helps when selecting colors...When using the software color-palette: simply look at the LCD keyboard screen, and the color on the LCD monitor will be exactly the color your Keyboard will back-light as, after system restart...The keyboard will go completely blank and shutoff after you select your color and then click Done/OK/Finish, as the OS restarts and logs back into Windows-Explorer, it will turn on again as it adjusts to your new colors settings -- and badda-bing, badda-boom, badda-bang, you're finished!!!I am extremely happy now, thanks Logitech!!!", "rating": "pos"}

I just wanted to comment on some of the negatives that others have mentioned and I have read prior to purchasing these.  I'm glad I didn't let some of the negative comments sway my decision to purchase.  Isolation headphones take a bit of adaptation but are well worth the initial adjustment period.  Yes, isolation style buds do amplify your breathing. Yes, if you don't clip the cord to your shirt to allow some slack in the cord, you will hear cord rubbing noises through the buds.  And if you wear for more than an hour at a time, they can feel irritating in the ear canal.  These are just a few minor things that you can work around.  Nothing is perfect.What I like about these, is that they keep engine noise out when I use them with my iPod shuffle on the motorcycle and they fit nicely inside a full face style helmet.Regarding the bass response.  You have to keep in mind that a shuffle doesn't have any bass boost like the old style walkmans or other large player. I a/b'd these with my old sony walkman muff style head phones and they definitely beat out the sonys when listening to a home stereo which offers bass adjustment. So I could really see that the Klipsch do measure up when using something with better sound quality than a tiny apple product.I was a little leery of getting this product and now I'm glad I took the plunge.

{"title": "Perfect!", "body": "This little FM transmitter has shocked me completely. There is minimal static that comes through in certain areas but for the most part I play my music loud through my 15\" subs so I can't really hear the static until I turn it down some and even then it's very minimal.  I play the music through my iPhone 3gs' iPod and also from the Pandora app.  You simply have to find the right station on you radio that has no reception what so ever and dial that station into the transmitter and when you do, it's on! One thing that I don't like about it though is the short cord b/c when I have to use my phone I have to unplug it from the charger. Either that or damn near put my head in the ashtray to talk. LOL! I guess this is where bluetooth comes in handy. I've read other comments about having to place the transmitter close to the radio and it's true.  You will get much better reception this way. But, I don't have a problem with that because I just sit my phone in the cupholder right beside the radio and it's fine.  Oh, the charger works great also!", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Worth the money", "body": "Having a local Staples store around the corner, I've been able to test out all the latest iPad keyboards, cases, and most of them I've brought back for a refund. This was not one of them.The case's magnetic case turns the iPad 4 off (which I have), so that's a plus. The keyboard is a bit cramped but it's a qwerty keyboard with NO function keys  separately above the numbers. The function keys are combined with the numbers so most number keys have three functions: The numbers, special symbols above them, and fn keys (music loud, etc...)It fits perfectly in landscape and portrait mode and my only CON is that after waking up from sleep, the iPad can take up to 30 seconds to find the keyboard. Especially if it's been asleep for a while. I REALLY like the cursor keys and so will you.The only other gripe and it's not he keyboard's fault is a way to switch between open applications other than tapping the home button twice.

{"title": "Low-cost life extender for older systems", "body": "Don't think you're going to play any modern games with this card - I had a system with motherboard integrated graphics that maxed out at 1280x1024, and NO PCI-E slot. (ARGH!) so buying a new widescreen HD monitor was a problem - this card was inexpensive, and the ATi 9XXX series cards had always done well for me in the past, so I popped this card in, went to AMD.COM (AMD owns ATi now, so that's where you go for drivers) and found the driver package I needed.About 5 minutes later, I was running at 1920x1080 and image quality is excellent.This technology was released in 2003, so you can expect good performance for games from that era.  I can't answer the question of \"will it play Crysis?\"; because quite frankly, If I wanted to even try to play something newer, I would have picked up a Radeon 4650 or 3850 instead, which do have AGP versions available, but are kinda pricey given what they are - you start to pay a premium for AGP with later cards because they aren't all that common (i.e., not mass-produced).

{"title": "A keeper.  Good instructions, great graphics, very responsive.", "body": "I've returned every GPS in the past 10 years. Regardless of price, I hated them all.This is the first GPS that I'm keeping. This is a great unit for reducing traveling stress.The 5\" size is perfect. Just like Goldilocks, a smaller screen would be more difficult to see, any larger would block vision and wouldn't fit into my pocket. This is just the right size.I considered an iPad3 with the navigation app but I felt it was too large and I'd have to mount the iPad below the windshield making driving more dangerous.Installation and updates took me about 70 minutes from the time I opened the box to the time I downloaded all the maps for North America and updated the unit.*** What I really like about the unit ***All major exits have actual photographs so you know exactly what lies ahead of you. As an example, the photo of an exit showed two big electric towers and trees which was exactly what I was looking at.Lane assist. The unit tells you which lane you need to be in. Some exits on interstates are on the left.  When I was driving in the far right lane in heavy traffic I wasn't able to change lanes fast enough so I had to drive miles before I could turn around.Voice command: I've had units with voice command in the past and the responsiveness in noisy vehicles were awful.  This one works extremely well.I say \"Voice command.  Home\" and it works.  \"Home\" and \"Go home\" works but \"Go Home\" is more reliable. When entering an address, speaking in a normal conversational voice works much better than trying to speak robotically.More reliable maps. When I received the unit, the year old Whole Foods store wasn't listed. After the map update, the store was listed. My old Garmins didn't list major locations that were 5 or 10 years old.Free lifetime map, 4 times/year!  My Garmin from many years ago was a money pit due to the expensive yearly map updates.Screen is very responsive to touch. Probably on par with an iPad.If you put your finger on the satellite bars for several seconds, a screen with all of the satellites and their reception strength appears.  I found this by experimenting. I didn't find this feature in the documentation. The most accuracy possible is 10 feet. If you're obtaining a much weaker signal and accuracy reduced to 100 feet, then don't expect timely instructions.POIs have the phone numbers so I can call to see if they're open or make reservations.Display and speaker volume are automatically adjusted depending upon the ambient light and noise level.Variety of dashboards. Choose the dashboard style that suits your need. I chose the non-default dashboard since I prefer more information.*** What I don't like ***I have no idea why the unit will not provide an audible sound if you're speeding in North America. The European versions do warn you if you're speeding.  I don't know if the lack of an audible alarm is due to American law or Garmin's policy but the omission of a major safety feature is very disappointing.The voice assist gives misleading instructions. For example, it'll say \"turn right then turn left.\" But there might be a few intermediate streets before you need to turn left.Lack of consistency. Sometimes the unit won't warn you in advance when you need to make a turn.I wish the unit would give a bit more warning to make a turn, maybe 20% more time so that I could slow down a bit. Yes, you could look at the screen for the turn information but I'd like to be able to view the screen as little as possible.No red-light camera alert in this model unless you have a Smartphone (I don't) and the information is paid subscription.Voice quality is poor but volume control is great. Garmin needs to use better speakers.In practice, the 3-D buildings are useless. In my city, only some building are shown. I've turned it off.Pedestrian mode is awful. Trying to find my car in a parking lot was a chore. My very old Garmin units would lead me exactly to my car; this gets me only somewhat close even with 10 foot satellite accuracy.  I'll try Setting->Navigation->Calculation Mode->Off Road and see if that helps. Finding a location in the city was a chore. Fortunately, the restaurant was only several blocks away so I only had to walk back and forth a few blocks until I found the restaurant. Even then, the GPS depicted me as being fairly far away. I'm in a small city so I don't have the satellite \"canyon\" effect like NYC.trafficTrends:  No thank you. I'm not giving Garmin my data of when and where I drive, how fast I drive. And Garmin, please stop asking me to share data with you on the map updates. Sharing data with you doesn't help me and probably slows the device down.Sometimes the behavior is strange. I gave instructions for a particular address. The business was in one of the buildings across the street that had a concrete divider so I couldn't make an immediate left turn. The unit didn't tell me that I passed the business or to turn around; total silence and no screen alerts. To make matters worse, the GPS lost the destination location altogether.  This has happened several times.Another example of weirdness is the unit gave me totally bogus instructions when I needed to make a left turn on a major road. The directions told me to turn into a residential neighborhood and drive in a complete circle and come back to the main road.  I saw this same behavior in the Nuvi 50LM.*** What I would like ***The ability to have the Faster/Less Mileage option button at more locations such as on the map without having to drill down. Sometimes Less Mileage is faster in the city.Expanded mileage searching. When I'm looking for POIs or business types, the unit sometimes will only return results within 3 miles or so. Other times, I get results up to 40 miles.Having an option to allows the unit count down the number of feet before making a turn.  The unit will say \"Turn left on Maple Street\".  Problem is that there are a number of streets that are fairly close to each other and no street signs.  So that I don't have to look the GPS screen, the unit should say something like \"500 feet, 400 feet and so on\".  I think this would be a great convenience and especially a major safety feature especially on very busy road.*** SUMMARY ***While I haven't tried all the features out yet, like Traffic, and I don't have the unit connected to a Smartphone, the unit does a very good job of confidently getting me where I need to go which is the sole reason why I bought a GPS. The voice command typically provides enough information so that you don't need to keep looking at the screen.", "rating": "pos"}

It worked well for my wife and I, but after many years of service it finally failed.I purchased this unit as a replacement.

The microphone booms are now moldable so that you can adjust the microphone to fit next to your mouth exactly as you want.  The foam that covers the mouthpiece has been enlarged for even better wind-noise suppression.This unit continues to use replaceable, long lasting AAA alkaline batteries rather than a non-replaceable rechargeable battery.  This way, you don't find yourself with a unit that is inoperable due to a battery that needs recharging.  Just toss the old alkalines in the trash and replace with fresh batteries for continued operation.My wife and I use closed-face helmets which work great with this unit.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Love them!!", "body": "The search for speakers for my new home theater setup was not easy. I was unwilling to compromise audio quality but, at the same time, wanted the speakers to be small and unassuming.I looked at a range of options including Bose (horridly overpriced for the sound they put out, but quite small), Anthony Gallo (wonderful, but pricy) and Orb. I was about to purchase the Orb system, but came across a review of the KEF speakers that made me think they would be worth a look.So very glad I did! While the Orbs are pretty good speakers, the KEF just blew them away. Crisp highs, solid bass. Dialog is clear even when watching a poorly mastered DVD.While I put looks secondary to sound, the KEFs are winners in the looks department as well. Beautifully finished, and can be table or wall mounted without having to buy anything else. (They also sell floor stands - got a pair of those for the surround speakers. Very nicely made, although rather pricy for stands.) The subwoofer in particular is stunning - not boxy like most, but a donut shaped piece that can be placed upright or face down. Bass is plentiful but not boomy or harsh.Granted, you need a decent receiver to drive these - any speaker will sound crapy if it is hooked to a low-end receiver. I'm using a Denon 1909 and the KEFs (in a 7.1 configuration) and the system works very well.The people at KEF did a great job packaging the system as well. Each box is solidly built, with molded foam to keep the speakers intact while they are in shipment. Each piece also comes wrapped in a cloth pouch, which adds to the presentation. You know if they take this much care with packing their speakers, they probably took as much care in building them.Highly, highly recommended!!", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Simply one of the best IEM's I have heard in this price range and beyond", "body": "OK, I have owned so many IEM's I have lost count of them all but many of them have been top tier expensive models from Monster like the Monster Turbine Copper and other brands and models like the Sennheiser IE8, and more.This headphone competes with pretty much any of them. It has it's own unique sound which I will get to but the bottom line is this IEM is an unbelievable bargain for it's price.To start this is the first tangle free cabled IEM that I have found I like the cable. It's flat which will help make it tangle free but it's not heavy or rubbery and has some of the least microphonics I have heard and that while wearing the IEM straight down from the ear versus looping the cable over ear which always helps remove microphonics. This is good though because the talk control button make this IEM unable to be looped over ear. From a comfort perspective these are also very comfortable ranking up their with the best IEM's I have used.From a sound perspective here is my take:Bass - The bass on these will be to light for some people as it is the least bass oriented Monster headphone I have heard. Having said that I find the bass to be perfect for the genres I listen to which are classic rock, accoustical music like folk and country, Celtic, Jazz, classical orchestral music, choral, New Age. I suspect people who like genre's like dubstep may not be happy with the bass. The bass that is there is controlled and textured with good sub-bass and a very slightly elevated mid-bass.Midrange - Out of the box the mdrange felt slightly recessed but after a day or two the midrange shifts to being slightly forward. The midrange balances a fine line between transparency and sibilance and wins(singers S sounds can have a bit of ssss to them if the original recording had this captured, I don't think the IEM causes this sound, just reveals it it). This IEM has an excellent level of detail allowing the emotion of singers to be fully portrayed.Treble - The treble on these again rides the fine line between sparkle and sibilance and wins. I love how cymbals sound, they have sparkle and decay without sounding tinny or static like.Sound stage - the sound stage on this IEM is quite large with good width and depth. I have heard better but not without spending hundreds of dollars.This IEM is one of the best bargains of 2012 in my opinion and should be tried by any serious music lover looking for an upgrade to their current IEM.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Marantz moves into the forefront of providing quality high-end audio products", "body": "Let me first say, that I have had a nightmare with receivers particularly 2 Onyko's which were good sound-wise but simply wouldn't switch anything through the HDMI.  This Marantz changes everything, from the moment I got this I can tell the difference in class.  The video switching is perfection and the sound quality is excellent.The great thing too about this receiver is that it is easy to connect up, I have the full 7.1 speaker set up plus a Blu-Ray Player, an HD-DVD Player, a 5 Disc DVD Player, a Multi-region/Multi-system DVD Player and a Playstation 3 plus my daughter uses a VSmile Console.  I also have a Laserdisc Player but I haven't connected this yet but this receiver has plenty of options.  With the help of the on-screen menus, you can easily set up and assign everything plus you can ensure that all your speakers are connected correctly by testing everything with the sound check.I have tested this receiver with everything including Super Audio CD's, DVD Audio CD's and 7.1 DTS Master Audio Blu-Rays.  The sound quality is sensational and the receiver just likes to perform and will handle anything.  The remarkable thing too is that the video quality matches the sound quality.  I haven't had a receiver perform better overall.  The other thing I like is that everything is kept basic, there isn't 10 different buttons, you just rotate a control to select your choice of device and turn up the volume.  This is the essence of true audio, a good receiver doesn't need a bass or treble control etc, if it is truly great then the sound will not need adjusting to compensate for this or that.  I have it set to direct audio and I am away.  Don't get me wrong this receiver has multiple options to embrace all the current technologies so it will suit both the techies and people who just want to keep things basic.  My one concession is to use the standby feature which will turn the receiver off if I am not using it.  This is a nice option.Truly this receiver is a delight especially after my previous experiences with Onkyo and it brings Marantz back to the forefront of providing quality high-end audio products.", "rating": "pos"}

LG tech support was very helpful but not sure why they didn't suggest that in the first place.  Netflix works like a charm now.This TV has a fantastic picture and the sound is MORE than adequate for my bedroom.  The magic remote controls the cable box too and can control other devices.  It really is a neat remote especially if you like playing around with the smart features.LG also has a really neat smart remote app for my android phone.  I love it...because when my kids misplace my remote, i can use the one on my phone.  Using my phone, I can hear the tv on my headphones so my wife doesn't get disturbed.  That itself is an awesome feature......you can also switch video between the phone and the tv.I like this so much more than  the M series tv from Vizio.

Nice layout but just not the nicest remote to use.Haven't tried the 3D on this tv, will eventually get around to it.  I do have a LG 60LA7400 and the 3D on that is outstanding!!!

{"title": "Built like a brick!", "body": "I've always been impressed with APC's build quality, and when I had the opportunity to test out this model in my home office I jumped at the chance. This device will protect your computer and related accessories from inadvertent shutdown, or from getting fried in a power surge. They aren't cheap, but it is a very solid and sophisticated (and HEAVY) device. I suggest that if you want to rack-mount this, only do so in a floor standing unit - and near the bottom of the cabinet. I'd be very hesitant to mount this on a wall-mounted rack. It weighs around 75 pounds and is difficult to move around, but once it's set up you can use it quickly. It took about 15 minutes to set up, including installing and running the control software. You can configure this device to shut down items in sequence, or all at once - fully - or a restart. In the event of a power failure, you can configure it to automatically shut down your PC and then the peripherals.  I wish the installation instructions focused a bit more on configuring the software, and the connection instructions are mostly pictures - not very helpful, but I feel much better with this battery backup system safeguarding my computer setup in my home office. Everyone (especially us New Englanders) who gets power failures regularly should add this important device to their computing infrastructure.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Slick looking cover, lacks extras", "body": "This is a beautiful Kindle cover. My mother was quite impressed when I took it out of it's package and showed it off. But even the candy red artificial croc, can't hide the fact that inside, it is lacking in basic extras, like a stylus loop, clasp, and more secure corner elastic. I am picky about the corner elastic/securing mechanism for holding my kindle safely... This is very basic. 4 loops of elastic which don't go very far around the corners. We shall see how long it remains firmly attached and secure.Installing the kindle was easy. Just fit the kindle in behind the elastic, and stretch the final one around the remaining corner and it is secured. Make sure the corners are up as far as possible so that your kindle will not become loose.The cover is pretty, but you can't judge a bookcover by the way it looks alone. It should secure your kindle properly, inspire confidance in it's ability to hold, and also have some nice extras which it lacks. In spite of it's attractive design this is a very basic product which could be improved with a bit more attention to detail.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Nice display but horrable camera wires", "body": "The camera wire is so chintzy and thin and trying to splice with out breaking and solder it is more or less impossible and is more like soldering no more then 5 fine human hairs together. Finally after having my system professionally hook up the technician found that car the camera was defective. The wire having been so thin going into the camera defective or lose was the problem. After spending the money on installation and having it sent back for a replacement and then reinstalling it would be ridiculous so I decided to get another replacement camera. I have purchased and ordered many other Pyle products before and they preformed satisfactory. I can not understand why Pyle would cut corners on there camera. I am sure that if they spent a few more pennies on upgrading the wires from five tinny hairs to a much better wire they would have better customer relations and every one would profit!In my conclusion to this product I would not recommend this unit unless you order another separate camera better and quality that works with this unit. Pyle took a very bad short cut and was real chintzy with the camera wire to cut corners. After putting in another new camera, this system worked like it should. I wanted this unit because the monitor is a nice big and turns on quick and has a separate off and on switch on the display which is real handy for a second optional video RC input source with multiple angles.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Works exactly as advertised for my setup", "body": "I purchased the Harmony 900 to simplify the control of my home theater system.  It replaces 4 remotes, one of them being very complex in terms of having to change inputs and outputs - my Yamaha receiver.I picked the 900 over the Harmony One because I wanted to use closed cabinets, and I have a Samsung DVD player that has the IR receiver on top of the unit, and it has always been very difficult for it to receive commands.  That player happens to be on the top shelf of my cabinet, and its remote was driving me crazy, only working reliably within a few feet of the unit.  I figured that having an IR repeater close to it would solve the problem, which it did with amazing results.The 900 also lets me control the components behind closed cabinet doors, which works well for me because it reduces the noise created by my cooling fans.The remote came with two boxes, one holding the remote and its cradle, the other, the remote's rechargeable battery (looks like a phone battery), the power supplies (2), two IR extenders and the IR receiver and a USB cable.  The CD had the old version of the Harmony software, the Logitech web site had a newer version used instead.  The manual is in PDF form and again, a trip to the Logitech web site gets you the most current version.I had read the first thing to do with these rechargeable remotes is to charge the unit for a few hours before attempting the setup which I did.  This prevents the unit from quitting on you while it's being programmed, and also gives it enough juice to work with the RF unit that processes radio signals into IR commands.The software setup was very simple - I was asked to create an account with Logitech directly in the software, and it asked me to connect the remote.  It picked up the remote type and then asked me which devices I had by type, brand name and model number.  It found all my devices, old and new, except that my Roku was under the DVD section.  In fact, I found out where it was by doing a web search on the subject because I couldn't find it.  I wish the software would let you pick a brand and model, then confirm the device type based on that, as opposed to first selecting a type, then hoping you made the right selection.The software then helped me setup two basic activities, watch TV and watch DVD.  I used all defaults.After the remote was programmed, I checked for a firmware update, which was found and applied.I setup the RF receiver so that the IR transmitters are in front of the components, a tip garnered from other postings, as the transmitter is actually on the side of the wire going into the repeater, so it's easy to point them the wrong way.  If that happens, the component may not see the IR signal at all so positioning is very important.When disconnected from the USB, the remote's screen asked me for the language to use, then went through a diagnostics process to verify connectivity using a wizard - everything worked the first time and it was quite fun to experience.  The wizard checked a couple of things, first that the IR functionality was working (cabinets open), then that the RF was also working (cabinets closed).  It also told me it needed to update the RF receiver, which it did wireless directly from the remote - that took a couple of minutes.I didn't have to do any custom programming - all the functions were mapped to the appropriate buttons on the remote, and made sense.I don't care for the volume controls and the channel selector to be on the left and right respectively, most remotes I'm used to have the volume on the right.  Other than that, the spacing of the remote buttons is very good and the buttons are sculptured based on what they do, so tactile feedback is good.The remote's backlighting and screen turns on when the remote is picked up, although I found that it goes to sleep quickly using defaults and it takes a bit of shaking to rouse it again once it's picked up.The screen on the unit works really well, and is similar to what you'd find on a small smart phone.  The resolution is good, touch sensitivity is good, and does its job well noting that my setup is \"simple\" with only four components to manage given what this remote can do.  The fact you can add text to buttons on top of icons is helpful too as some of the icons are not self explanatory.The software aims at being simple and tries too hard to anticipate what you want to do, and it often fails or has you go through four steps when one would be enough. As such, it can be frustrating after you have a hang of it because it's limiting.  Example: renaming a device takes five clicks, three screens. A rename button, text entry and press enter would be simpler no?Also, the software doesn't work unless you have an internet connection (at least, it wouldn't let me get past the login prompt).  Let's hope the Logitech web site and my ISP don't go down as I'm not sure I could change settings on the remote if that was to happen.This is my first Harmony remote, so I can't judge on the speed of the screen or the lack of sequences or issues programming from the Apple platform - these have apparently been hot button issues.  So far, I'm not experiencing any problems and the Harmony 900 is doing everything I need it to do with ease.  It works just as well, and in most cases, better than other remotes I have, in particular my receiver, thanks to a good layout and design that feels comfortable and simple.I'm operating the remote in the room where my equipment is, so I really have no RF range issues either.  I also use IR for the TV, and RF for the components inside the cabinets.Beyond the basic setup, I have setup favorite channels using custom icons, and changed default timings (my TV power on feature was set at 8.5 seconds delay for some reason).  I found that it's not currently possible to change icons for activities, the custom icons only work for favorite channels right now.  Not a biggie as all buttons can always be labeled with text.All in all, I find the 900 easy to use, and it works flawlessly thus far for me with four activities.  Getting a hang of how it works is necessary because there are many tricks to use to work around what the software won't let you do directly, such as, learning sequences from another remote using the learn function or using dummy devices to introduce delays.  I wish the software had an \"I know what I'm doing and accept the consequences\" mode, but it insists on leading me by the hand.I now have a drawer full of remotes I no longer need, my cabinets are closed, everything works, and my DVD player now understands commands the first time, so mission accomplished.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Shiny Green case fits Kindle Fire and Kindle Keyboard among others", "body": "This is a bright shiny green case. Some of the product pages make it look more dark leafy green, but if you look at more of its pictures, you will notice that some of them are more shiny bright green. It is shiny bright green. The surface looks like a cross between duct tape and a really sloppy paint job (which reminds me of my painting skills). But if you like unconventional colors and designs, this certainly fits the bill.And while it is unconventional on the outside, on the inside, it is a very good case. On the left side, there is a pocket for storing flat things (notes, business cards and the like) that runs from top to bottom. The case has four straps at the four corners, so it gives you some flexibility on the type of devices it can fit. The original Kindle Fire (2011 model) along with the beloved among hardcore readers Kindle Keyboard (third generation) fit well. Also fitting are the 6-inch Kobo Touch and Kindle Basic (buttons only). I don't have access to any of the touchscreen e-ink Kindles or the newer HD color Kindles, so I don't know how well they fit. The Nook Simple Touch is too square and too short to fit. Anything wider, longer or thicker than the Kindle Fire or Kindle Keyboard will probably not be a good fit.There is no loop inside for a pen or a touch screen stylus. There is no strap to keep the case closed and no magnetic clasp.This is not a feature but a hack, but if you are using it with a lightweight e-reader (the Kindle Fire is too heavy for this to work reliably), and if you are on a surface with strong texture, you could open it up as a tent and use it as a poor man's stand. However, this may slip easily if the surface is not textured enough. So don't do this unless you are going to be extra careful and a potential fall from the table would not be catastrophic (eg fall on a thick rich carpet versus a concrete floor). And there are no kids or pets running around.The inside color pattern, black with bright green stitches, could actually make a nice color scheme for the exterior as well.", "rating": "pos"}

The Kinivo switch works exactly as advertised - it allows multiple HDMI components to connect through one cable to the TV and switches automatically to a component when it is switched on and passes a signal to the switch. The included remote is generally unnecessary, but it's nice to have - especially since my daughter can play with it. The switch itself is compact and very lightweight, which is a problem only because stiff cables (such as the 3' BlueRigger HDMI cables with the braided sheath) need to be positioned carefully or they will make the switch slide or lift up. The power supply is the typical wall-wart variety. I do find it a bit odd that Kinivo chose to put the power port on the side of the unit (rather than the back) and the output port on the opposite side so that cables are sprouting out of it in three directions, but I can live with that given the price and the fact that the switch is hidden in a cabinet. Those without A/V cabinets will either have to hide the switch (which is entirely possible given the auto-switching capability) or live with the sight of cables running all over the place. Overall, the Kinivo HDMI switch is a great product and tremendous value.", "rating": "pos"}

What I initially thought was purely video editing software has proven to be a pretty deep package of video AND audio software that's easy and fun to use.  The tutorials are simple and intuitive, and it's extremely easy to get up and running.The meat of this software is Movie Studio Platinum 13, and it couldn't be simpler for a novice to use, but it's also sophisticated enough to keep the advanced user's attention.  The biggest bonus for me is that 13 is enabled for touch screen computers, and makes this software all the more interesting and fun to use.  I use this program with a Sony Vaio 20-Tap Touchscreen computer, so coupling this software with another Sony product is probably best, but regardless of this fact, the program runs flawlessly.  It responds to touches and commands just as any other program would.Another great perk is this new version supports 4K technology, so if you're looking to upgrade, Studio 13 will be a great option for you.  It also comes with DVD Architect Studio 5.0 which allows you to make DVD's and Blu-ray discs as well.  I've tested this program with Blu-ray discs and had no problems, but I will say the sound seems to suffer a bit.  I'll update this review as I use this feature more.What I especially love about Studio 13 is it comes with Sound Forge.

Sound Forge is a much better program with more options and a friendlier interface, and I've been ripping records with a lot more joy than I used to!  The sound itself never suffers, and the editing features are deep even for a sound program you typically pay a lot of money for.  It contains all the usual tricks like fade out, click removal, noise removal, etc.  If you're looking to rip your vinyl collection, this is a great bonus.All in all, I'm extremely happy with this software, and use it on a daily basis.

I got the C550 because of the built in BlueTooth connection to her cell phone. She keeps the phone in her purse sitting on the floor of the truck and when a call comes in or she wants to make a call, she just pushes a button on the C550 and it brings up her address book. She can touch the screen when the correct name appears and the system does the rest. The day after we got the GPS we went on a 1300 mile trip and it never missed a beat. The lady that speaks to you seems to get irritated if you don't turn when she tells you too. Example, we were in Williamsburg, Va. looking for a place to eat. We punched up fast food and saw a McDonald's and told Millie (that's the name of the GPS - you gota name her!) but just before we were supposed to turn on the street for the McDonald's we saw a Chick-Filet and kept going, boy did she get mad she kept saying \"Re-calculating turn around in 500 feet) - Great product - good price if you look around the internet.", "rating": "pos"}

The sound quality is fantastic. I still have to play with the EQ and other audio settings to probably fine tune the audio quality, but so far it has been fabulous with the sound!! The light was too bright for night, but the \"dark blue\" color minimized it pretty OK. Still have to play with this unit a lot, but I am loving it so much.

The only very minor complaint is that it's a little difficult to slide the lock switch at the top. It sometimes takes a little more effort to move the switch, but isn't really all that inconvenient.

{"title": "Best Golf GPS I Have Owned", "body": "This is my third Golf GPS and is by far the best. The watch format keeps the GPS with you at all times. The downside is that the battery life is not infinite but neither am I.I don't understand all of the complaints in the review section. Like most electronic devices there are periodic updates to resolve issues that have come up. When you first get your S3 you should connect it to your computer to get the current software updates and latest course maps. If you don't do this your S3 will always have these old (resolved) software issues and poor course mapping.The accuracy of any GPS Golf device is a function of the electronics and the course mapping. The best the electronics can do is about 10 feet which is fine for my golf. I don't know how well the S3 electronics actually do on the course because the course mapping comes into play. I also use a laser range finder for when I am close to the hole (within about 200 yards). I have seen the S3 agree with the laser (if the pin is actually centered) and I have seen them disagree by 10 yards. This disagreement is on a hole by hole basis so it leads me to believe that mapping is the issue. Most holes on most courses I play are reasonably close. If they were always close I would not use the laser. Other GPS brands may have better or worse electronics and course mapping. It is very hard to tell. I have the most confidence in Garmin.Bottom line is that I highly recommend the S3. It may not be quite perfect but it is very, very good. It will give you reasonably accurate distances and speed up your play. If you need more accurate distances then pair it with a laser.", "rating": "pos"}

It prevented the end user to have to incorporate an additional combiner when coupling two antennas together. However, the amplifier does make the difference in receiving a number of digital over the air channels or not. Great product .

Picture qualities are very similar between plasmas and the LED with plasma getting slight edge in deeper blacks which is a big part of the picture quality.  now why my title says great picture most of the time could very well be due to the camera angle.  i watch a lot of hockey (go wings!) and notice that the picture isn't even as good as my lcd at this particular camera view.  the problem occurs where you spend most of the time watching, and that is at the farthest camera from the action. im thinking thats the issue because when they show close ups the picture is absolutely perfect.  tomorrow is sunday so im excited to see if i experience any imperfections in football, if so im thinking ill spend the extra 300 bucks and get an led..ill update at some other point.for those who wants other details about the tv read on:it does not have wireless internet capabilities, needs a hard line connection.  the apps are great; netflix, cinemanow, pandora, facebook, etc...was told it had a web browser but can not find that, thinking the salesmen screwed up that tid bit.i do hear a very faint buzzing but believe that is quite normal with plasmas, barely noticeable muted, certainly not a big issue.stand is very stable.overall im happy but hockey is an 82 game schedule and is watched mostly from that one angle i spoke of, if football has any problems i will probably return it for an led which i would rather not since theyre so expensive.  hope i helped.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Dell Venue 8 Pro 32 GB Tablet (Windows 8.1)", "body": "First off I can't believe how this tablet is boxed.  When you open the box make sure you don't have it tilted.  The tablet sits right at the top of the box and you could possible drop it on the floor.  That's the first thing I thought when I pulled it open.  The tablet itself is nice and works fairly well.The biggest thing I don't like is the WiFi will partially disconnect.  After using the tablet for several hours the internet will stop working.  The WiFi is still connected but with a yellow triangle and an ! in it.  I then have to disconnect and reconnect to the WiFi.Another thing that I don't like is Dell has this software running on the tablet that is supposed to help keep your tablet running.  When you check for updates this software doesn't help let you know what is already up to date on your tablet.  It just recommends everything that is new on the list.  Even if it is already installed.  Why doesn't it just scan my tablet and tell me what updates are available.Not the tablets fault but Windows 8.1 sucks.  If it did everything from the desktop it wouldn't be so bad.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Great Sound", "body": "I am very impressed with this soundbar, it has exceeded my hopes.  I purchased it for our bedroom and have it running through a 47&#34; LED 3D HDTV.  We have a large bedroom and it fills the room with ease.  The sub is just ok, nothing to write home about, but it does the job.  I have not had any issues with it interfering with our Wi-Fi or any lag in it from sync issues.  I have it hidden behind a recliner and it is not in the line of sight of the soundbar like the instructions tell you and it still works fine.  The sync with our Time Warner Cable remote was a snap, it couldn't have been easier and works from a long way away.  I did not mount it on the wall but I have it set to wall on the back instead of the shelf setting, it sounds better.  I have my IPod connected as well and it sounds very good.  One neat thing it does is remember the settings for each mode you have it in and reverts to it when you are in that mode.  It switched to music for the IPod and movie mode for the TV.  It also comes on by itself when you turn on the TV. That can be a minus if you don't want to use it all the time and just want your TV speakers on.  If that's the case you can always turn the main power off on the back and turn your TV speakers back on.  I would buy this again and recommend it if your in the market for a quality, simple to use sound upgrade.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "The perfect case for the Canon G11!", "body": "I bought the new Canon G11 shortly after it came out and the first thing I wanted to do was to buy a case to keep it looking like new. I settled on this one and I'm really glad I did. The G11 fits in this case like a glove! I was afraid that it might not because it may have been originally designed for the G9 or G10. I didn't want one of those cheap looking nylon zippered cases because they're ugly and don't usually offer any real protection.

{"title": "Five-star performance at a three-star price", "body": "Yes, it really is as good as all the reviews say.Although to my ears, most quality digital media products sound more alike than different, the Oppo stands out in overall performance. It sounds as good as anything out there, limited only by the quality of the rest of your system and by the bitstream the producers put on the disc. It has an amazingly quiet noise floor...totally dead and silent when there's no content with no sign whatsoever of hum, noise or those annoying little clicks you sometimes hear on other equipment. Unlike a few other players I've auditioned, it seems to handle dirty, scratched and finger-printed disks well, and so far I've never had one fail to play.I find audio, video and 3D performance to all be topnotch, although so far, I'm only using the HDMI outputs and not the analog ones at all. The HDMI implementation is quite good, and I've tried it on a few of my systems without problem. Whether fed direct to a TV/projector or routed through other components, it just seems to work. Video on my plasma and projection units are vivid and rock-steady, and although I don't do lots of 3D, what I've seen so far is quite impressive.I'd say the Oppo is so good, it's a no-brainer - just go out and buy one, and put the thought, energy and money you save into other parts of your system.

Cross street names were easier to read on the older unit, but the street name navigation more than makes up for it.  I am not in a traffic service area so I cannot comment on that.

THIS CASE IS NOT ATX SIZED! From the documents included with the case it is designed for either microATX or miniITX form factor motherboards. The ONLY thing that is ATX sized is power supply opening. Again, Amazon is not the only company to make this mistake as I checked out the same case on other websites and they too list this as an ATX case.

{"title": "Excellent price for sound quality", "body": "I upgraded/replaced the speakers in all 4 doors of my Mazda3. The front doors were upgraded to some Pioneer 3 way 6x8 speakers when I first got the car. They provided a noticeable improvement over stock, but these Infinity's provide an even more noticeable improvement over the Pioneers. The rear doors still had stock paper speakers from the factory. Installing these Infinity's in all the doors really improved the sound. Cleaner, clearer, crisper highs and more filling mids. I get by with their lacking (still good) low range by running a 10\" sub at 200W. I tried the speakers out with my factory radio and it was better, but once I upgraded to an aftermarket head unit with more power, these speakers really came to life. I also turned on the 3db tweeter boost, and angled the tweeter up at the occupants location, very nice sounding. I'm not a crazy audiophile, car stereo junkie... but these offer some really great performance and sound for an exceptional price.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Same as Patriot Box Office", "body": "I got this box when it was on sale. It is basically identical to the early batch of Patriot Box Office (Patriot Box Office 1080p High-Definition Media Player PCMPBO25 (Black)) and is very similar to a bunch of other network media players using the same RealTek 1073DD chip like Brite-view CinemaTube, ASUS O!Play, ACRayn PlayON!HD, etc. It comes with bootcode 16 and firmware 02 (or 01?), but it can be easily updated using Patriot's firmwares (and even other firmwires after patched). I had it flashed to FW053 after initial testing. It plays the mkv, rmvb, and other file types as described that has a better compatibility than the WD LiveHD. I hooked it up to a router set as WDS bridge. It can stream video files (even 720p) from my network drives or share folders connected to a separated wireless router smoothly. Once I put in a 2.5\" SATA2 drive, I can enable the BT client and SAMBA server function. The BT client works as describe but it has very primitive settings or functions. The BT performance is comparable to my laptop, while file transfer to or from the box (and connected HD) is rather slow. It would be much better to transfer files to another NAS drive and stream to the box. The subtitle support is very good. It decode embedded as well as external subtitle files in multiple languages (including Asian languages) with the options to change color, size, and position.If you get this box, make sure you go to Patriot's support forum to learn updated information.

Lower frequencies are again, MUCH more prominent. I haven't really had a chance to play music through it but I can safely assume that the lower frequencies will be exceptional given the price of this sub.

{"title": "Excellent addition to the TF700t, but mine was defective", "body": "The dock is a super addition to the tablet. Note that I have not yet rooted the tablet (and won't until day 31), so certain things that various root packages may address, are not listed here.The good:* This keyboard / dock combination, though a little pricey, provides the bridge between having a tablet only, and being able to choose at will between tablet-only and small laptop* Joining or separating the tablet to/from the dock is simple and nondestructive (no data-loss, unexpected shut-downs, etc.)* Additional weight isn't a big factor* All connections are located on the sides, which avoids the tablet's poor placement of the only data/charging port at the bottom (where it must be consciously protected from flexing and such)* Adds ports for full-size SD and USB2.0 (type A, host-mode), which greatly and importantly expands the tablet's usefulness* Adds at least four hours of battery life to the unit* Provides a nice keyboard with several Android-specific function keys and a few hardware-specific function keys. For those curious about the keypress feel, it is what I would call \"medium spring\" in terms of its compliance. It is very similar to my Microsoft Natural Ergo 4000 concerning pressure necessary. The keys all spring back properly into place, and it has an overall good quality feel. No keys are ridiculously out of place from how most keyboards are arranged.* Adds a trackpad, if you're into those (but see cons), which has a left-click and right-click portion in addition to the tracking / mousing part* Permits the tablet to be handsfree, avoiding the purchase of a dedicated stand* USB host mode support is one of the most important benefits of this dock. It provides the ability to hook up a broad array of devices, including hard drives, mice, even cameras, which you can then not only read, but in the case of a dSLR, even control. Unfortunately this dock only offers USB2.0, though I've seen that the next version will have USB3.0 -- perhaps it will be compatible, much like the 201 is sort of compatible with the TF700t.* The SD slot provides support for at least up to 64GB cards formatted exFAT; I don't have anything larger, but can confirm it works with this and smaller ones formatted with both NTFS and FAT32* Physically, the hinge seems strong and well-made. It requires a decent amount of force to change the angle, slightly more than the laptops I have owned, but not excessive. It cradles the tablet nicely in a deep groove, and provides alignment tabs to assist with proper placement of the tablet. Upon completion of the placement, a lock slider gives a gentle clickCons:* The first one arrived defective; everything worked except the USB port and the SD slot. Nothing would fix them. I did the full Linux cold boot sequence, which didn't work. I then contacted Asus support and per their instructions did the system reset and user data wipe on the tablet, to no avail. That is now a return for refund, and because I'm impatient, I purchased a second dock locally on condition of testing it first. I'm listing this as the first con of an otherwise excellent device, because this defect is not limited to mine; many people on several forums have experienced the same thing with theirs. Asus isn't doing enough quality-testing, perhaps. Test all functions of yours upon receipt.* Most apps, including the OS, are stuck in landscape mode when the tablet is docked, with no system-wide override* Balance is apparently improved over the prior dock, but the tablet still can tip over easily when docked; be aware of this when using it, since it can tumble off your lap* The trackpoint does unpredictable things if you rest your wrists on it while typing. I have ended up disabling it (a simple keypress is all it takes) so that I don't have e-mails being sent mid-sentence, random apps opening, and so on* No &lt;del> key is on the keyboard, which stinks (unnecessarily, there are two Fn keys and the one close to the arrow keys should have been &lt;del> -- a dumb design oversight, I think)* The dock does not ship with a charger; it's expected that one would use the charger supplied with the tablet, but still, there are situations where charging both separately would be useful or necessary. Further, it cannot charge via USB; only the 40-pin proprietary charging plug does it* No user override for the special Android keys that toggle several important functions like screen brightness, wifi, bluetooth, mute and so on. It's nice that these are there, but a misplaced keystroke above the numbers row will result in unexpected behavior including interrupted downloads (miss the 1 key), presentations muting (miss the - key) and so on. I am having to slow my typing speed due to being more careful.Other thoughts:* Inserting the tablet into the dock is easy, and I have found it to be most foolproof when this is done with the tablet laying flat on the keyboard (sandwich-style). Attempting to align the tablet when perpendicular to the dock does work, but it's easier to make a mistake. I think of those tiny connectors becoming damaged over time, and quickly stop trying, and just do it my 'right' way (flat)* Not listing this a con, since I think this is a Jelly Bean thing, not a dock issue: the Ctrl, Alt and several other keys do nothing in most apps* The manual states that the dock will not charge the tablet. This is a silly oversight, since it *must* charge the tablet, since that's its function. I believe they meant, the tablet will not charge the dock. In a 10-hour long battery-only session, I watched the dock and tablet charge state go from 100% and 100% to dock at 0% and tablet at 100%, which is perfect. The tablet provides enough voltage to the dock to keep it working, even if the dock battery is reported to be 0%. Plugging in the dock does charge both halves of the device when they are connected. Obviously, plugging in only the tablet charges only the tablet, since its charging port is only available for charging when it is not attached to the dock.* Another non-con for the dock, but something for your awareness: the mouse wheel scrolls backwards in several apps. This too is a driver issue or something app-related, but is worth a note here since without the dock, there is no mouse compatibility.* This is not a surprise, but the dock heats up during charging. I'm not listing this a con, since this is normal for rechargeable batteries and can't be avoided; nonetheless the user should take care to not overheat it", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Have cell phone reception where we didn't before", "body": "When you first see the product, it resembles 2 silver wireless routers. One part is the outside receiver, the second part is the indoor one.You set up the indoor part where ever you want to have your cell phones signal amplified at. An office or living room makes a good location since you want to use a place where your okay with anyone going there to make cell phone calls, and also you want to use a room with a coax cable. If you set it up in a bedroom, you'll find everyone (including guests) will have to go in there just to use the phone.The outdoor receiver can be set up in 3 different ways:GOOD RECEPTION: You can mount it near or on a window to get what the company calls \"good\" reception. This is what I did. We live in Northern Minnesota and I was concerned with how the adverse cold weather here (ice storms, hail, snow and below zero temps) would damage the casing of the receiver. Also if I was to mount it outside, the signal might be affected if layers of ice and snow gathered on top of it. This also kept me from having to run a coax cable outside.BETTER RECEPTION: The next best option is mounting the receiver outside your location on a wall. This would work well if you were to mount it near where your cable box is on your home, since you probably already have a location near there drilled through your walls/foundation for your TV cables to go through. It also may have a kind of shelter built onto your home to shield your cable box from the elements, so if you were to place your receiver box there as well, it may provide it some shelter as well.BEST RECEPTION: Mounting your receiver on a pole mount above your home. The higher you can get it into the air, the better your signal will be. Mounting it on some kind of poll or antenna above your home would help get you the most bang for your buck (but there will be little shelter from the elements.) I suppose you could also mount this onto the outside of a brick chimney (depending on if your chimney gets warm or not or if you even use it).You are given 50 feet of coax cable to use for mounting. If you end up mounting this inside your home, you may want to use your own (shorter) cable or else you will have a bunch extra just stuffed somewhere.Overall this works just like they explain. The closer you are to your indoor receiver using your cell phone, the better your signal will be. Your not tethered to the receiver with any kind of cables, so you don't need to worry about having a cell phone with any special connections. This also works with data cards for computers as well, which could make this product very helpful if wireless data is the only way you can get internet access. Very good investment for anyone who needs good, reliable cell phone reception.", "rating": "pos"}

I LOVE the wedge shape! Having a nerve issue in my right hand, the textured wedge shape makes holding this tablet far more comfortable than the iPad clones. Full size SD card is also nice, since it allows the use of very cheap memory cards. Major drawback is that the memory card can only be used to transfer files, or to play media files.

That means you will get about 50% more battery life with this attached. And it is not that uncomfortable to talk with it on although I do prefer to only use it on occasions when you would normally take a camera. With this everyone will think you have a point and shoot camera and will probably be thinking &#34;why doesn't he just use his phone to take pictures?&#34; Then if you take a call they might say &#34;geeee, you see that dear?

{"title": "Good deal for the money.", "body": "I bought 4 pairs of these in Jun, 2011 (two for friends and one for my wife as well) and have used them for over two years now.  My pair just broke last night; a small plastic hook that keeps the spring-loaded clip in place broke and the whole thing just fell apart.  The other three pairs are still going strong.Note that these work with RealD presentations in theaters, but not IMAX or Dolby3D, so check the type of 3D the movies you're going to is being presented in;  this can vary from screen to screen, even within the same cineplex.  I've used them for Pacific Rim at one theater, but when I went to see it again at another theater, they used Dolby3D, and I couldn't use these.My recommendation:  Since these are fairly fragile - there's no frame around the lenses, and no protective case that comes with them (I used the plastic bag they came in to carry them around) - they are very susceptible to damage, so consider getting an extra pair.  I wrapped mine in a microfiber cloth and then stored them in the original plastic bag.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "good device, need to be knowledgeable to use all functions", "body": "The DIR-506L is a useful device with some great features. Once you learn how to set things up and put it into use it performs very well. However, there are some set up functions and things that might be a bit much for someone who is used to plug and play devices that require little more than removing it from the box and turning it on.Whether on an Android or IO6 device you are required to download 2 apps. One is to set it up as a wireless and the other is for media sharing. In order to access the files, it requires you to go into your browser and enter an IP address in order to connect to your shared media files. Without the manual, setting up and using this device would be near impossible. The installing of the battery and physical connections to devices is easy, but the configuration is not. As a charging device it works fine and is the simplest function. Recharging a device is the one thing you could probably do without the manual. If you connect it to an wired internet connection it is fairly simple to use as a wireless hot spot, as is broadcasts its SSID, but as a media server it is a bit complicated to set up.Once you do get it set up as an interface and a server, it does perform well.

{"title": "Great unit overall but \"not so great\" Bluetooth", "body": "Reviewing the JVC KW-NX7000BT head unit. I installed this unit into my 2009 Honda Accord sedan using the Scosche kit.Cosmetic Features: This unit looks great. The screen resolution is more than acceptable but it wasn't as \"tight\" as my Garmin Nuvi 755T. That has a really sharp display. This is by no means crap though. You can adjust the brightness, color, etc. on the unit so you can change it to your tastes. The unit has a detachable face which is great when you have an aftermarket unit with a big screen sitting in your car. I paid $699 for this unit and don't intend on having it stolen so this is a plus (although the unit does NOT come with a backstrap for securing it to the vehicle). Detaching the face is easy...there is a button labeled \"Open\" which allows you to open the face to insert a disc or SD card, tilt the face up or back down or detach the face. When detaching the face, the unit has a motorized face that slides the face down and out at a 45 degree angle which makes it very easy to remove from its backing plate. A padded neoprene case is provided for the face. What I liked about this unit is the \"screen real estate\". It's a full 7 inch touchscreen display with a few buttons on the bottom of the unit. When listening to the radio or using the nav, certain functions disappear from the touchscreen after a few seconds. To make them reappear, the unit senses your hand approaching via two sensors flanking the JVC logo on the bottom of the display. Pretty cool. You can adjust the proximity sensor to turn it off or make it so that you have to actually touch the screen to get them to appear. As other reviewers stated, you can't change the background display to your own JPEG. There are 4 types of backgrounds to use and then you can change the color of those backgrounds (red, purple, blue, etc.). The included backgrounds are acceptable. I usually have the nav map on anyway. You can dim the screen 3 levels or wire it to your illumination control so whenever your lights are on, the unit will dim. I chose to not wire it to the illumination wire because you can set a dimmer \"time\" on the unit. So at 4pm each day the unit will automatically dim to my preset level and then at 7am the next day, the display will be on in full brightness. There is an on-screen clock too. While on the nav, it's in the lower left corner. On the standard screens, it's in a box in the lower left corner. If you want the clock on while playing a DVD, you can do that by turning the option on in the settings menu. The startup time of this unit is VERY quick too. You get that stupid warning screen about keeping your eyes on the road each time but within 10 seconds, the OK button will illuminate and you're up and running. The volume function can be done in two ways. There are hard buttons for volume on the lower left part of the face (one button for up, one button for down) or you can just use your finger on the screen and draw a clockwise circle to turn the volume up for a counter-clockwise circle to turn the volume down. Pretty neat.DVD Features: Nothing standing out too much here. The movies look great and sound great, you can 16:9 or 4:3 movies, subtitles, etc. The remote works the functions well too.iPod Control: I purchased the JVC KS-U30 iPod A/V Cable and plainly said, it sucks. Other reviews talked about the iPod function being slow and boy is it ever. When I had my Honda factory radio installed, I had a Peripheral iPod interface that was very fast when going from one song to the next and to the next. Searching the phone book was very bad (I have about 6500 songs in my iPod) but as long as I loaded a few playlists for the music I wanted to hear, it was perfect so that's actually how I use my iPod to this date. With the JVC unit, when you start playing a song, you need to wait for the song data to load before you can go to the next song so you can't just click forward, forward, forward to skip a few songs. You'll actually have about an 8 to 10 second wait before you can do that. Searching the entire iPod isn't so bad because there is a scrollbar on the touchscreen that allows you to get through your iPod database without too much pain. The best thing you can do is set up a few playlists and access your music from there. Album art is horrible. I was actually excited about this part but after installing the unit, I'm grossly disappointed. After the song starts playing, you're not supposed to touch any controls for at least 30 seconds while the data loads. You then press the display button and the album art is displayed but it looks horrible. Album art is usually a perfect square. They've taken that perfect square and centered it on a small 16x9 shaped box. The detail isn't good enough to look at. All in all, I would not recommend using an iPod with this unit.SD Card: Instead of using my iPod, I loaded up some music on a 2GB SD card and it's awesome. You lose the ability to do repeat and random but it's FAST. Music loads within 1 second and as long as your song's ID3 tag is up to date, you can still get the artist, song name and album name on the screen (the other item that shows is the actual file name of the track so you may want to rename the files before loading them on the SD card). I'm not regretting the purchase of the KS-U30 cable because I'm sure there will be a day when a friend wants to load their iPod in my car or maybe I don't have time to load music onto my SD card so I'm glad it's there. The JVC unit has SO many features that for $39.99, you might as well get the cable so it's there when you need it for your iPod in the future. Install everything in one shot if possible.Bluetooth: Now maybe I'm a little spoiled because I had a Parrot MKi9200 Bluetooth kit before this unit but in my opinion, the Bluetooth add-in is pure crap. Installation was easy. Plug in a DIN cable and microphone...done. The sound quality seemed as if it hurt my ears. Think of a walkie-talkie. It's something like that. Callers complained of echoing on every single call. The microphone is pretty small I guess (barrel style about an inch long) but it's holder is HUGE. It's meant to be clipped onto a visor. I have my microphone mounted on the top of my steering column away from any windows so it looked huge there. In the end, I reinstalled my Parrot Bluetooth kit and I have my good sound quality back. This actually ended up being a good thing when you mix the iPod into play. There are various sources within the unit: DVD/CD, Satellite, iPod, Bluetooth, etc. I would be listening to my iPod (and remember how slow it is) and then a call would come through. The unit would completely switch sources from iPod to Bluetooth to take the call. Once the call was done, it would switch back to the iPod but now it has to do that whole reloading thing again. HORRIBLE. It doesn't just mute the music...it completely disconnects the iPod source from play. Now that I have my Parrot kit installed, it simply mutes the music and when my call is done, there is no wait to start jamming again. I would highly recommend the Parrot kit or another external kit to be used with this unit.XM Satellite Radio: I just installed the CNP2000UC and JVC CNPJVC1 connector cable. I read some mixed reviews of this unit online and I gotta say that I didn't have ANY negative experience with it. Got both items from Amazon in-stock when just about everyone else is out of stock. Since the CNP2000UC is a universal unit, you need to program it first with a computer. It comes with a proprietary USB cable. The directions did not spell out anything about the process really but luckily other people left reviews about what to do. Here it is...go to [...] and download the XM Direct 2 application. The instructions on this website said to plug in the USB cable first and install the drivers and THEN install the XM Direct 2 application. You need to install the XM Direct 2 application first which loads the driver files into a folder on your computer. When you plug in the USB cable to the unit, it won't be able to find the drivers until you point it to the C > Program Files > XM Direct 2 folder. Once I did that, the install went fine (it does flag you that it is an unsigned driver but you can install it anyway). The specs state that you have to have Windows XP but it installed perfectly on my Vista Home Premium laptop. Also, you HAVE to use Internet Explorer. It will NOT work with Firefox. Once the program and drivers are installed, just double-click the XM Direct 2 icon on your desktop and it will open an Internet Explorer webpage to download the correct firmware. Choose your manufacturer and model number and click the \"Run Firmware Loader\" button to begin. The entire process took less than 10 seconds. Installation into the car was simple too. The JVC CNPJVC1 connector cable requires a +12V constant and ground to be connected. The DIN cable is plugged into the head unit and there is a female DIN connector tied into the harness in case you have other things like a Bluetooth kit or CD changer...it's a pass-through cable. Install the antenna and plug it into the mini-tuner kit, then plug the mini-tuner kit into the main module. I contacted XM and had them swap my new unit in place of the Honda factory XM kit and I was up and running in about 10 minutes. What I love about this kit is that it's FAST just like the SD card. I listen to XM and my iPod a lot. The iPod part sucks but the SD card takes it's place so I'm very, very happy with this unit. When you have a unit with this many features like the NX7000 does, you don't want anything to run slow.Navigation: The unit uses Navteq maps which is fine. The layout is nice, screen looks nice and the overall function of the nav is good. Comparing it to the Garmin Nuvi 755T though, there are pros and cons. The Nuvi had A LOT of speed limit indicators that would show up on the screen. I live in a medium-sized town and most of the roads were labeled with their speed limit. I've only seen the speed limit pop up once on the JVC nav and it was on the highway which the speed limit is almost a no-brainer (most areas are 65mph but there are some 55 and 50mph areas). The best thing I like about the nav is the turn by turn audible cues. With the Garmin unit, it had a speaker but if you're playing music and traveling on the highway, you can't hear the updates. You can set the JVC to give you a pleasant tone, a quick 2-burst tone or no tone...then you can set the volume of a very smooth female voice to come on and provide the directions or turn the volume all the way down to zero so you can just follow the screen. I took a road trip with people to a place I had never been to and it worked like a charm. While the other 3 people were talking loudly, I was able to hear my turn cues and get to the destination easily. This is nice too when you're on a long road trip and get in the \"zone\"...the audible cues ensure that you don't miss your turn. This one feature...the audible cues over my car's speakers...makes the change from Garmin to the JVC nav all worth it. Your current speed is a function in the nav but not on the main screen like the Nuvi. No big deal...that's what the speedometer on the dash is for so I really don't think it needs to be there. You can save a bunch of favorite locations in the nav, choose from previous ones, rename them, set a home location, etc. The standard set of GPS functions are included in the unit. Searching the POIs was easy too but my only gripe is that the search comes back with the alphabetical listing which could mean that the first option at the top of the list is 300 miles away. You need to press a button on the screen for Distance and then you can find what is close to you. No huge deal but I would hope that could be changed in the future. JVC has a Nav Update website available ([...]) and the 2009 map update was released on 12/22/09. What's nice about Navteq is that they tell you what's included in the update. I didn't see anything for my area so I won't buy it. What's bad is the the map updates are expensive at $139 a piece. Garmin map updates are around $70 but then again, they don't tell you what's included in the update so in the end, I guess I'd rather spend $139 knowing that the updates WILL make sense for me instead of paying $70 to Garmin not knowing what I am getting. I am still a huge Garmin fan (I've had the Nuvi 660 and Nuvi 755T) and I'm happy to say that this GPS in the JVC unit is great. I don't feel like I'm losing anything without the Garmin. I would definitely recommend this nav.Sound: I used a PAC OEM-2 factory sound system interface for my unit since I have the factory 275-watt stereo so I'm not really using the internal JVC amp. The sound is better then the Honda factory unit because a 7-band EQ is included. There are a number of standard EQ presets like Rock, Pop, etc. but you can also set 3 user presets. The EQ presets (including the user ones) are accessible from the main screen. Just press the square on the left side of the screen and there is an EQ icon. Each time you press the icon, it goes through the EQ preset list.Steering Wheel Control: I installed the PAC SWI-JACK steering wheel control unit and it works good. There is a slight delay when pressing the volume up or channel up buttons but it's no big deal. I wasn't able to program my Mode button to change the source but with so many sources, that could be the reason why I can't. Also, the Channel up and down button on my steering wheel will take you forward or back on tracks (no fast forward or rewind) while listening to the iPod or SD card, will take the XM station through its station presets up or down but when listening to the radio, it works like a Seek button. Again, no big big deal but it's a difference.Honda Accord Scosche Kit: This is a really nice kit. I bought this from Amazon for around $40 while Crutchfield was charging around $70 for the same kit. The texture of the kit is slightly \"rougher\" than the factory piece it replaced but it doesn't look out of place. The color (grey) is also just a touch lighter than the factory piece but since nothing else around it with the same color butts up to this unit, it's not bad. It's more of a complimentary color. The unit fills up the whole double-DIN opening. When mounted normally, the unit sticks out a little more than I like because of it's detachable face (about a 1/8th inch past the bezel). It definitely made it look like an aftermarket unit. I ended up moving the unit back in the brackets a bit and I had to cut out a little plastic on the front lip of the kit using a Dremel tool so that the motorized face would still work but in the end, it's recessed about a 1/8th inch and looks custom and integrated (aka - factory). When the face is installed, you can't see the part I cut but you can when I remove the face but if the face is removed, that means I'm not in the car so I don't care what that looks like.Backup Camera: I didn't get the JVC backup camera made for this unit (mainly because they were out of stock) so I went for an Advent license plate mountable unit. It works good. When you shift into reverse, the camera automatically comes onto the screen. For normal backing up I don't really look at it but if I'm backing into a parking spot, it's pretty nice to have and the 7\" screen gives me the best picture possible.All in all, it's a great unit. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the poor Bluetooth unit but everything else is great. You get a TON of features for such a low price point. Definitely a recommended unit.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "user friendly and excellent quality", "body": "I purchased this camera from amazon in May 2007 and have been very satisfied with the performance in terms of quality of videos, camera features and ease-of-use. I have not tried taking pictures from this camcorder as I believe that digital cameras do better job there and made for taking pictures only.Pros:- Small size, easy to carry and handle- High zoom which is very stable in terms of focus- Night shot is great for indoor videos with low light- The screen can be swiveled completely, which makes it easy to make your videos with camcorder in your hand. (Most fun is while recording kids and showing them themselves while recording)- Mini DVDs can be formatted in wide angle, which makes videos look great  on wide screen monitors and TVs.- Battery life very good and sufficient for people like me who are not in  making pro videos.- Software given by Sony is easy to use and transfer videos to computer.- Lot of otehr features in terms of light control and editing the videos are also very convenient to understand and use.Cons:- None yet.

{"title": "A power-hog that takes good pics", "body": "I bought this as my \"everyday carry camera\" to complement my DSLR.  I specifically wanted something that would take good pictures, use the same memory card format as my DSLR, uses AA batteries, and is inexpensive (so I don't have to worry about babying it).I was attracted by the combination of size, style, and features at this price.  The 5x optical zoom, 8MP resolution, and large LCD are all exceptional at this price.  And the picture quality is impressive.  The results are sharp with good color and exposure.  Focusing is fast and reliable.  And there are plenty of options, including full manual control over aperature / shutter / ISO, tweaks to sharpness and contrast, and the expected set of options for JPEG compression and resolution.  Using a 2GB card with highest resolution and lowest compression, it estimates it will hold about 400+ pics.The pictures I've taken thus far have turned out really well.  The movie mode works great too.  My only complaint is the power consumption.  I use two 2500mAh rechargeables, and I'll easily run through them in a single afternoon of walking around taking only a few dozen pictures.  There's no optical viewfinder and you can't take pictures with the LCD off, so I'm not sure how well you can tweak it to use less power.That said, I always take along spare batteries, and with the camera being relatively small, it's not a big problem.Overall, I'm very happy with this camera, especially at this price.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "The keyboard is fantastic, the mouse not so much", "body": "The idea of buying a keyboard and a mouse together as a combination deal sounds like it could be a money saver, and it is; buying the items separately would cost more for sure. But there are compromises.The MK270 provides a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse. They run off a single USB port using a typical USB receiver. This is both good and bad. It's good because you only take up one USB port, but it's bad because you can't use the keyboard in one location and the mouse in another.In my case, I ran out to Walmart to buy something on an emergency basis because the keyboard on my desktop failed. I figured fine, I didn't need the mouse but I can use it with a laptop. I should have looked more closely; you can't do that with only one USB receiver, and that's all you get in the package.The keyboard, though, lives up to Logitech's highest standards. It's built solidly without being heavy or bulky; the &#34;touch&#34; on the keys feels just right, and it's really quiet. The keyboard has a full compliment of keys; there's a numeric keypad, and a series of auxiliary buttons along the top for changing volume, playing media, launching email, etc. The manufacturer advertises a two-year battery life; given that the keyboard has autosleep and an easily accessible on-off switch on the top, I find this a credible claim.The mouse? Pretty average. It's ambidextrous--- you can use it with either hand. It's comfortable enough, it tracks well in ordinary use (although it's hardly a gaming mouse at this price), and it has a scroll wheel. The biggest issues? It's light and flimsy, and it only has two buttons. So this is a very basic, close to low-end mouse.There are the barest minimum of instructions, but really, how much of an instruction book do you need with a keyboard and mouse?What's my bottom line on the package? At the price you can get it for on Amazon, it's worth it for the keyboard alone and if you're not fussy about mice, the mouse is a usable extra. So I'd have to say that the package is an outstanding deal and I have no trouble recommending it. I completely love the keyboard.One thing to note: I'm in Honolulu, where prices are higher than on the mainland, and buying this at Walmart cost me TWICE what it would have cost to buy it from Amazon. That's what happens when you need a keyboard NOW and can't wait 10 days for shipping from the mainland.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "A Great Alternative to the OEM Grip", "body": "Some things for my camera *have* to be OEM -- certainly anything that affects image quality.  But let's face it -- this is a battery holder with a few buttons.  Why spend $150 (or more) for the OEM grip, when you could go through four of these for the same price?  And you get two batteries included with it, which you still have to buy if you get the Canon grip.  This is a steal of a deal.The fit and finish are as good as the camera, and the plastic finish on the grip matches the camera's perfectly.  I compared this grip to the original Canon, and other than a slight difference in the rubberized grip texture, you can't tell the two apart.  Function-wise, it works as it should, and just like the Canon model.The two included batteries have a slightly higher capacity than the OEM ones do, which gives you a bit more shooting time.  They'll charge in the Canon charger, and you can use them interchangeably.  It looks great, it works as it should, and it's dirt cheap.

{"title": "It's a Monster.", "body": "This guy is big. I use it in the shop and its great with the bluetooth connection. I can literally walk 30+ feet away with my phone and the system is still cranking. The sound is good but not what I would call high fidelity. The quoted 400+ watt output is a bit overrated. But don't get me wrong, this thing is loud but you really can't push it because of the increasing distortion. For a party system it is great. But don't compare it to the sound quality produced by a high end amplifier/speaker system. For the price it can't be beat. The Sony does outperform older inexpensive audio systems. So there are some enhancements in speaker technology for that price nitch. In a small space this thing will definitely wake up the neighbors. The main thing is you have an amp and speakers all in one. It is pretty portable. And it connects your storage device via bluetooth rather every time. I just click on the phone, hit the song and push a button on the Sony and I am connected. It is just as easy for your friends to connect and share the music.

{"title": "Well thought out and technically advanced with a few issues.", "body": "TL220 ReviewPROSMenu system is fast.  For a touchscreen i find it to be more than adequate. Response times don't keep you waiting.Very \"iphone-ish\" in the sense that its touch and has features like multi-delete (select as many pictures as you want to delta in one fatal swoop instead of deleting a single image at a time), accelerometer for browsing pictures and tap to focus, which is sweet.Sweet continuous shoot mode. Seems to capture fractions of a second at a time.HD Video is very nice. You can trim video on the device itself and select a frame from the video to save as a photo.Form factor is great. Not the smallest, but the size seems to fit the quality.5x Optical Zoom is a treat for a point and shoot.Fast boot to picture: It takes less than 3 seconds to power on the camera and snap your first photo.I like that it has distinctly different audible beeps for 1) a positive auto focus lock and 2) when its not able to autolock the focus on your subject. Even the front LCD displays a \"red Reticle\" for bad focus and a \"green reticule\" for perfect focus when doing self portraits.Smart Modes: In my low lit living room, the camera auto-detected that there was not adequate light and adjusted itself for the environment. The result, a nice picture with lightened features with no dark spots.Slide show mode: You can select exactly what pictures you want to play. You don't have to sit through all photos, including the bad ones. It has about 5 different preset audio tracks to play while watching the slide show. Nice touch.Image Stabilization works in both photo mode and video mode.Can record video without an audio track if no audio is needed.CONS:Front LCD Screen does not turn on when shooting in videoMicro SD a pain to deal with (adapters etc)When shooting video, when you zoom in or out, the audio cuts out while the lens is in motion. Once the lens stops moving, the audio kicks in again. very odd.When importing into iPhoto on Snow Leopard, the videos do not have thumbnails or video preview. They appear as black squares in the photo album until played.You have the ability to attach audio snippets to your pictures while they are in the camera. However, once you import all pictures, the wav file is separated from the picture and it becomes an orphaned file. IT doesn't stay embedded in the picture or data file. So you end up with an SD card full of wav files in your card unless you delete them.MINOR GRIPESBattery door seems flimsy. Since this is where the MicroSD card is I'm a bit nervous it may break in the coming months.Move the clown image for small kids to a more intuitive location in the software (like with the other front LCD settings).The camera does a nice job at recognizing faces then waiting for them to smile before taking a picture. Problem is that once you sync the pictures to your computer and empty the SD card to make room for the next round of photos, the face recognition goes away and you have to reset those faces you previously detected again. It memorizes up to 20 faces, but they don't stay in the camera permanently. That is unless, you leave the pictures on the camera after syncing them to your laptop.Only place i noticed some lag was in picture review (scrolling side to side to view pictures).No mac software included. Only Windows.Display brightness setting only affects rear LCD, not front facing LCD.Not intuitive how to set your own start up image when the camera powers on. I found the option but it's not as intuitive as the other menus and I have yet to figure it out.The camera is HD. Why not include an HD cable to connect to ones TVMAJOR GRIPESpeaking of TVs, this morning I hooked up the Samsung TL220 to my TV to play some video that I shot. Boy was that a mistake. Two concerns: One is that when connected to the TV the screen on the camera goes blank. Instead you navigate by looking at the TV where a small mouse cursor appears. This takes some getting used to. Two (and the largest issue here) is that it kills battery life. The camera charged over night, and by 11am (after shooting some baby videos and outputting them to the TV) the battery just died. You get a nice message saying battery is low, and then it shuts off. So, caution when connecting camera to a TV. It burns the battery at both ends!What I WOULD ADD IN THE NEXT VERSIONSD Card instead of MicroSD (eliminate need for adapters)Metal case for durabilityGPS taggingBlueTooth transferFront video screen enabled when shooting videoIN SUMMARYNice camera. I opted for the $299 job which has smaller pixel density on the rear LCD and is 3\" instead of 3.5\". In my opinion, the extra $50 is a nice option, but the innards are all the same. Plus, i like the ergo-grip that the extra space on the back of the camera offers when you opt for the 3\" screen. It inspires confidence that the total stranger i ask to snap my picture wont drop the camera.4 out of 5 stars.Well thought out device.Highly recommended.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Take great photos without any photography knowledge.  Comparison to S4500,  choose cost based on your photography needs.", "body": "We already owned a FinePIX S4500 and I will compare the SL1000 to this camera.  Currently the S4500 is about half the price of the SL1000. We love both of them, but the comparison below may help you make a choice between the cost/benefits for both cameras.These cameras are excellent choices for those who want more than a little point and shoot but less than a full fledge SLR.  They both offer the ability for the total photo novice to take excellent photos and as you learn more for you to take more control over the shots.  The size and weight are much lower than an SLR and the options much greater than a point and shoot.  If you are going to be taking photos of birthday parties, soccer games and vacation photos the lower end S4500 will serve you quite well, you can even move up to more complex photography by taking over some of the control from the camera as you learn.  If you want to move up to images you can really edit, higher optical zoom,  (want to be able to do extreme close ups) ,the ability to have different outputs,  to be able to add a fancier flash (perhaps use one you already have for an SLR) or video extreme close ups then you should chose the higher end SL1000.  You do need to manage battery use more with the SL1000, since it uses a rechargeable battery rather than standard AA.  For a more detailed comparison and more information continue reading.Weight and Size:The S4500 weighs about 19 oz (540g) with the AA batteries and the memory card) and the SL1000 about 23 oz (650g).  This would not seem like a lot, but held in your hand it does make the difference.  The longer optical zoom (50X on the SL1000 vs 30X on the S4500) means that the SL1000 is front heavy and it does feel heavier when you are holding it.  It is also physically larger although not a huge amount.  Carrying it in the case makes little difference.Image:The S4500 is 14 pixals while the SL1000 is 16.2.  When printing your average photos you will probably not notice the difference, we cannot tell which photos were from which camera.The S4500 has a focal Length of 24-720mm and the SL1000 from 24 to 1200mm (this is a big difference, you can take photos from MUCH farther away with the SL1000).  Full aperture is F3.1 (wide) to F5.9 (telephoto) on the S4500  and F2.9-6.5 on the SL1000.  The SL1000 can go up to the equivalent of ISO 12800 while the S4500 goes up to 6400, another big difference, meaning that the SL1000 can handle lower light levels.  Fuji is a leader here,  they get lower noise in high ISO shots without blurring detail (algorithms will decrease the image detail in some other camera brands).  There is some argument about how film ISO translates to digital ISO, but for comparison purposes across the same brand the SL1000 is much better here.JPEG  (Stills) and AVI (movies) are the only file outputs on the S4500 while the SL1000 can do JPEG, RAW (RAF format) and even MPO (Which is 3D) as well,  the movie output is in MOV form not AVI.The S4500 actually has more shooting modes (Zoom Bracketing, Natural Light, Natural Light & with Flash, Portrait, Baby, Smile, Landscape, Sport, Night, Night (Tripod), Fireworks, Sunset, Snow, Beach, Party, Flower, Text) than the SL100 which has (Portrait, Landscape, Sport, Night, Night (Tripod), Fireworks, Sunset, Snow, Beach, Party, Flower, Text).  They both have a Panorama mode as well.  The modes are actually pretty amazing, point the camera at a person and it knows the difference between that and a flower.The zoom on the S4500 is at the front while the SL1000 has both front zoom and a button on the side of the lens for zooming.  There is NO manual zoom on either, which those who previously use SLRs will find annoying.Both have a build in flash, but the SL1000 has a shoe (a place you can put a fancier flash, like for an SLR)Both have SR AUTO, Instant zoom, Face Detection, Auto red-eye removal, Framing guideline, blink detection, Frame No. memory, Histogram display, motion panorama, Face recognition, Date stamp and the SL1000 adds an advanced mode, zoom bracketing and a framing guideline.  The blink detection can be amusing, we have been told that the camera detected a blink in a tree....Video:The S4500 video quality is lower,  1280X270 (mono sound)  vs 1920X1080 (stereo sound).  This is noticeable when playing back on a TV both in image and sound quality.  However, the lower quality is perfectly acceptable, better than my Flip video and in both cameras you CAN use the optical zoom when recording video on both cameras which is really neat.Power:The S4500 uses AA batteries, and I would suggest the lithium ones.  In fact, with the lithium batteries the S4500 takes noticeably more photos that the SL1000 with its rechargeable NP85.  You need to buy another NP85 (two are less than 20 bucks on Amazon currently) so you can charge one while using the other.  The fact that you can buy AA anywhere makes the S4500 more versatile here.LCD:The LCD on the SL100 can fold out, should you want to hold the camera at a weird angle to take a photo and still see what you are doing.  This is nice, but adds to the cost.Summary:Either of these camera is an excellent choice taking your general photographs to another level beyond point and shoot but without the expense and weight of an SLR.  If you want to really get into photography or higher quality video is important to you, choose the higher end camera.  If you are not sure, you just want to take great photos without much effort,  go for the lower end,  you can still have some control as you learn to take better photos and if you decide later you need something fancier, cameras will have probably improved even more in the meanwhile.", "rating": "pos"}

This is not particularly high capacity by today's standards, but 8 GB is not that small either.  It's good for transporting a number of small files or a few larger ones or a backup of data if you don't have too much data.  Great for a key chain too, as it has a nice big loop on the end.  After I inserted it on a Windows 7 PC, it was up and ready to use in seconds.  On XP it wanted to reboot after it had been inserted, but I tried it without rebooting and it appeared to work fine.  Two minor issues with this drive.  It doesn't have a conventional USB plug.  Instead it looks like a little 3-contact connector.  At first I wondered how I would insert it into my USB port.  Believe me it does go in, but one problem I had was which direction to insert it.  It fits into one side of a USB connection in either direction.  In one direction it works of course and one it doesn't.  The other problem is that the connection hides under a little bendable rubber piece and my USB ports are recessed, so I couldn't bend the rubber enough to easily insert it.

{"title": "Nikon D90 Body", "body": "The D90 is a good camera that captures high resolution images as well as basic .MOV video files.  The D90 is essentially a maturing of the old D70/D70s line with 12 MP sensor vice 6 MP, and a 3\" LCD screen vice 2\" for the D70s.  The D90 has improved auto focus over the D70/D70s.  The live view is not what I anticipated in that prior to taking a still image the mirror has to be released to the down position before being retracted a second time and then exposing the sensor.  This obviously introduces delays and in some cases undesirable vibrations.  Missing on the D90, but present on the D200, is the two step mirror up option for taking photos where the mirror is first retracted, virbations are allowed to dampen, and a second command releases the electronic shutter to capture the image.  This is important for longer exposures and situations where a high magnification lens (e.g. 800-1200mm)is used on a tripod.  Also missing from the D90 is a user defined time-lapse video capture mode, similar to what the Nikon P6000 provides.  It would be a big benefit to include a 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 second user selectable inter-frame delay option for taking time lapse videos of flowers blossoming and other instances where time needs to be compressed.  Despite the missed engineering opportunities, the D90 is a good still image camera which should provide users with many years of capturing memorable moments in their lives.", "rating": "pos"}

If I was not so thrilled with the cases and only had the data cable I might have given this only 3 stars.  I am worried that the electrical components won't be good enough b/c they are not apple products and apple may actually have filters on what they sell.  I decided to try the wall charger and USB cable anyway and it seemed to charge just fine.  The only trouble is the hook on the right side of the part that slides into the iPod touch. Whereas Apple's data cable has a bump, this piece has a hook.  The hook gets caught and I'm afraid it may damage that port. Yes there are buttons on the sides to retract the hooks, but the button on the right side does not work. So I may have to find a file and file down the hook if I plan to use the data cable again.  At least all of the items in this package are for the iPod touch unlike the other bundle that I bought.  I also bought a different bundle and it had regular iPod accessories and iPod touch accessories- the regular iPod accessories will be useless for me at the moment.  This purchase was worth every penny- even the shipping.  Usually I only buy Prime stuff, but made an exception b/c the price + shipping seemed very reasonable.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Worth the price,  a Quality photo & camcorder in one package, with the backing of Sony's technology.", "body": "In a nutshell: This is a VERY nice camera AND video camera..yes it is expensive, but SONY technology has brought many innovations that really bring a \"bang for the buck\" on this camera. If you don't have an SLR or video camera, and want to get a very nice \"all in one\" camera you won't do wrong by getting this camera.Ok.. more details.. I use a Canon EOS Rebel T2i, that when I bought it through Amazon it came with both the standard lens and a zoom 55-250mm lens. I love my camera and basically I am \"used\" to it.When I opened this up, I noticed right away it is MUCH more compact, it has a nice weight to it and very balanced.I added some pictures to show you how it comes. You get the body, a 18-55mm lens ( pretty standard, nice..) a lens hood, strap,battery with wire free charger and CD's. No case, no memory card. I added some pictures of it in the product details (above)Ok.. What I LOVE .. it is easy to use.. charge up the battery up and start taking pictures..Other Pro's:1) It has ELEVEN filters... so you can get really \"artsy\" easily, with no outside software ( Photoshop, Corel etc...)2) VERY easy and reliable video.. this I knew would be a home run.. I have a SONY video cam, so I knew this would be a seamless no brainer.3) Battery Life.. for a tiny battery.. this sucker really holds a charge! I have not tested the battery life on video, but so far it really holds a nice charge taking photos.4) Lens Quality.. the included lens (18-55mm) is nice, capable, distortion free and a good basic lens.***** MAJOR PLUS *****5) NON-SONY lens adapter available!.. although I have not tried it, there IS an adapter (optional) that you can use your Canon, Nikon, Olympus etc..lenses on it..This is a MAJOR PLUS... Lenses are expensive.. several hundred dollars a pop at least! It is NICE to be able to use these on this camera! Again I have several Canon Lenses, and have not tried it with this camera, I am wondering if he auto-stabilize works with this camera - but I DO like the idea very much!6 & 7 ) \"Intelligent Auto Focus (..and iAUTO mode)\"these \"Pre-focus as you compose the shot, further reducing focusing time to a bare minimum.\".. in other words.. makes it a \"point and shoot camera..\" ( a high end one!) It is nice to just take a picture without worrying about speeds, exposures etc.. and a VERY nice picture which leads me to:8) A Whopping 24.3 Mega Pixels! I mean.. that is HUGE.. actually it is enormous!So what is the big deal? Well the big deal is Yes..if you are taking normal pics of the kids and the pets you don't \"need this\"..The big deal is that if you take a picture in this ultra high meg range, and you notice something you like that is smaller,you can zoom and crop and play with that section of the image *without* magnifying the image.For example I took a picture of a hawk.. it was very high up.. I took it in full resolution, then brought it to Photoshop, and was able to crop the hawk by itself, and it was still over 3000 x 3000 pixels and crystal clear.9) \"Auto tracking\" as perfected with their video cameras, you can lock onto a subject and the camera will stay focused on the subject.. great for kids & pets10) Compact! I can't believe they squeezed all this power into such a tiny package.11) A well made and printed manual, many camera ( and other things) come with CD or a link to the manual, the manual that comes with it, goes over everything in easy to use instructions.12) The \"Tru-Finder OLED electronic viewfinder\" It is incredibly sharp and detailed. The 3\" screen tilts and really fights glare very well .. but it leads me into the Cons:The Cons:1) No \"real\" viewfinder I like to look though the camera itself, not at a screen.. (This is just a personal preference.)2) Again this is nitpicking.. nothing to do with the camera, just an observation this is a fairly expensive camera it should of included:2a) A carrying case2b) A Memory card or stick.. come on SONY throw in a 4 gig card or stick!2c) No Zoom lens? (again I bought the Canon 2TI with the 15-55mm lens AND a 55-250mm lens for about 980 bucks)Maybe include a 30%-40% off coupon for one accessory ( case, Lens, memory  lens etc..) with the purchase of the camera?Again this is only nitpicking.. this is a really great camera!In a nutshell, this camera really does crank out stunning pictures, has a massive array of \"special affects\" built into it,and also shoots the best video I have seen on something that is a \"camera\" first.Throw in the fact that you can attach your other brand lenses to this.. and you know what?SONY may just have a real contender in the market here!Will it replace Canon. Nikon etc.. as a \"go to\" DSLR? I don't know, however I do know I could point & shoot this cam straight out of the box. I know there is sticker shock with the price, but if you don't have a quality camera and a quality video cam, this WILL do the job of *both* in my opinion, and therefore justify the price.I use this as a \"go-to camera\" when I just don't know what I am going to shoot, say at a party .. what am I going to take? pictures? videos? Bring this and I can do a quality job with both!Jim", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Works as expected, I think", "body": "I've never had another GPS device, so I can't compare the Magellan PCK to a TomTom or other standalone unit. I use it with the Navigon app; they work well together. I have used it in rural Maine and have gotten signal even when there was little voice/data coverage. In Boston Metro, it was very snappy, much faster than iPhone alone.Likes:- don't have to remove my iPhone case! Worked with both my 3G in a medium thick Contour, and the iPhone 4 in a slim iFrogz. Adjustments are pretty easy.- dash or window mounting. Mine's on the window and has stayed put. My Subaru has a textured surface on the dash; the suction cup will not work on that.- the voice is loud enough and pleasant. Volume is easily adjustable.- even if you're not using it for navigation, the mount can charge your phone. It also holds it in position so you can see who's calling when your driving; much better than fumbling through your purse or talking to someone you'd rather not (this is a benefit assuming you are using a hands free device when you drive).  Also, because it's just far enough away and visible to any passing cop, it takes away the temptation to check your mail, Facebook, text, etc while you're driving. (Hey, I'm a former road warrior who used to spend 2-4 hours a day in my car between appointments. If you need to text or FB or email, you need to pull over. End of.)Could use improvement:- wish it came with clips to keep the long USB charger cable secure against the car.- the charger light on the lighter plug end is very weak; don't always know if it's connecting. On the unit itself, it blinks intermittently, so you have to wait for it (you can check the iPhone, but if it's in the mount, the charging icon is small and hard to see while driving)- wish it came with a carrying case for travel/rental cars.Not sure if it's the MPCK or Navigon or User Error (probably the latter):- sometimes the voice guidance cuts out. You can still see the maps but for city driving, I prefer the voice.I don't need GPS very often, so buying an extra device seemed kinda silly. When I need it in the car, so far, the MPCK with the Navigon app has been a good solution with bonus benefits. Look for sales; I got the MPCK for $99 through Gold Box. Navigon goes on sales from time to time, too, on iTunes. Would recommend this combination to iPhone-toting friends with light to moderate needs. It may also be great for urbanites, too, but I haven't tried it in a city.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "So far so good.", "body": "Wow! This battery does exactly what it says. I would have given it 5 stars but had to knock one off only because you have to charge it separately and the camera does not read the batteries life.I have the Canon HF10 and there was no way I was going to spend $90 plus dollars on the 819 unless I had to. The battery comes by itself with no charger and almost worthless instructions. Example, one part says you cannot use the camera to charge nor the Canon power cord and suggests using one of theirs (Zeikos)purchased separately yet another section says to only use the original powercord. So, just as a goof I unplugged the Canon power cord from the camera and plugged it into the battery. Voila! It started charging. I gave it a good 3 hour charge before using.Next, I snapped it into my HF10 and it fits perfectly. I turned on the camera expecting a the \"battery not compatible\" error message everyone else has been talking about. But it didn't happen... the camera just powered on like normal. The only difference being the onscreen battery indicator is red and has a \"?\" inside the symbol. It cannot read the remaining battery life but happily uses it's battery juice as power anyway. The LED indicators on the side are great. Just one push and you know how much power you have left in 25% increments (25,50,75,100).Next I wanted to see how long the battery lasted on record. I set the camera to record in SP mode (7Mb/s), set the camera down and just let it go. I came back a few hours later and it had powered itself off. So I swapped the original batter in and turned it on. The Zeikos battery recorded for 2h:23m. Granted there was no starting and stopping nor zooming. I performed the same test again and got almost the same numbers. So I would say the battery lasts anywhere from 90 to 140 minutes depending on use (possibly longer in playback mode-but haven't tested that yet).All in all an awesome battery for the price. In fact you could buy 4 of these for about the same price as one Canon. Perhaps Zeikos has addressed those complaints from others about LED indicators backwards and onscreen message errors.

{"title": "Excellent feature set, and very reliable", "body": "I've been using the ReadyNAS series since before Netgear bought the company that started them: Infrant. My first ReadyNAS (NV+) failed once, corrupting all data. However, the corruption/failure never occurred again, not even with the successors, the ReadyNAS Ultra, and today's ReadyNAS 300 series.One thing I disliked about all the older ReadyNAS was their slow network transmission speed. Files took forever to copy from one location to another. When Netgear decided to revamp the ReadyNAS series from scratch, basing its processor on the Intel processor, the company has made great progress in the performance department.The ReadyNAS 300 with its dual Gigabit connections is quite speedy, though it is not a top-performer when compared to some other brands, such as Qnap, Synology, Drobo. What I do like about the ReadyNAS 300 are:1. X-RAID. Automatically expands your storage capacity as you add higher-capacity or additional drives without much user intervention. Traditionally, a RAID configuration requires you to back up the data, tear down the RAID, reconfigure it for the RAID protection you want, and restore the data onto it. X-RAID does away with that. For those who don't know what RAID is -- to put it simply, it provides storage protection. For example, if you have all 4 bays occupied with hard drives, you can lose 1 drive and still have your data in tact. Simply replace the bad drive with a new one, and your RAID is rebuilt, and you now have a redundant storage system again. Lose 2 or more drives, and the data is lost. The chances of 2 drives failing at the same time, however, is slim.2. RSync over SSH. RSync is one of the protocols this device supports, which allows you to quickly and efficiently synchronize one ReadyNAS with another, or any device that supports RSync. The SSH function adds encryption to your data transfer. So, what does all this mean? I set up one ReadyNAS to do a secure, nightly backup from one location to another over the Internet. This ensures that files at both locations are always synchronized. In older ReadyNAS models, only RSync without SSH was available (without doing any hacking of its underlying Linux/Unix OS.)3. WOL. Wake-On-Lan. I absolutely love this feature: you can remotely turn on your ReadyNAS over the internet or anywhere on your network. Configuration of your router is required, and I will share some of that at the end of the review. I also use the free &#34;NAS Utils&#34; app from the Google Play Store to send these WOL commands with my Android phone. This same utility can also be used to look at the ReadyNAS log files, power it down, reboot it, check storage, and more.4. Plex Media Server. The product supports PMS! It comes right-out-the-box by enabling its app through its web-based administration page. PMS can be configured to look at your file shares to compile a beautiful interface of your music, picture, and video collection. You can then watch your movies through the web browser, tablet, or smartphone, even over the internet! Take a look at the [plex (dot) tv] website for more information. Note, however, that the PMS version that comes with the ReadyNAS is old. I'll share some tips on upgrading it at the end of the review.5. DLNA. ReadyNAS 300 supports DLNA, allowing you to point your Playstation, XBox, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, WD TV, smartphones, tablets, Smart TVs, and more, to your movie/music collection for play over Wifi/your home network.6. Backup button. The physical backup button at the front of the device is convenient. You can configure backup jobs, and at the push of this button, it'll then run the jobs in sequence. I've configured each job to email me job results on error.7. Supports various authentication methods, including Active Directory. You can configure the device to precisely control who has access to what share, how, and through what protocol.Some things I don't like about the ReadyNAS 300:a. UI issue: Scrolling. The web interface is not touch friendly. To scroll up and down at some of the configuration pages, you have to use a mouse. The scroll bar won't show up until you mouse over it.b. UI issue: Backup button. The physical backup button is a great, convenient feature. For some reason, Netgear decided not to be able to initiate that button from the web interface. For example, if I wanted to remotely tell the ReadyNAS to start the backup jobs, I'd have to manually launch each job one-by-one.c. UI issue: Backup button jobs. In the past, one used to be able to re-arrange the order of the jobs. With OS6, jobs are run in the order they were added. Further, only 1 job is now run at a time. In the past, multiple jobs could be configured to run concurrently.d. UI Issue: when powering on the NAS, I would like the option to have an email alert sent to me.e. Backup: backup jobs are handled sequentially. You cannot run multiple jobs at the same time like with the older ReadyNAS Ultra series.f. Plex Media Server cannot be easily upgraded to the latest version. In fact, the version that comes with the ReadyNAS is many, many months behind.Now, on to some tips.1. Wake-On-LAN configuration. In the older ReadyNAS Ultra, WOL was very easy to configure. However, for some reason, with the ReadyNAS 300, I can only get WOL to work reliably by asking it to send the command as a Broadcast. This has to do with MAC address caching, but even with different switches/routers, I couldn't send the packet successfully with 100% certainty after 4 hours of waiting. As such, for issuing WOL commands over the Internet/WAN, I configured UDP 9 to point to the internal network's broadcast IP. In my case, it's 192.168.123.255 /24. WOL has worked every single time since.I also found that WOL only works over the Internet when the network cable is connected to the TOP network/ethernet port. If I remember right, that's Ethernet 1.2. RSync over SSH. WARNING: this is an ADVANCED configuration! If you don't know what you're doing, you could severely screw up your NAS! To do RSync over SSH, you first have to enable Rsync on the Target NAS. Then download the Certificate from the Source NAS, and add it to the Target NAS by pasting the SSH key (append) to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys (on the Target.) This tells the Target to trust the source's certificate. An example backup job can be configured as follows:Name: SOURCE copy to TARGETSource: Share | Name: share: sharename.Target: Remote | Name: remote:Rsync over Remote SSH | Host: addressofTarget | Path: /data. Advanced: Remove deleted files on sourceWARNING: be sure you test the backup job on dummy shares, not on production shares! This gives you the opportunity to ensure that the paths are all correct, and the job is configured the way you want it to behave.3. Plex Media Server: configure for playback over the Internet. I set up my router to point TCP 32400 to the ReadyNAS 300.4. Plex Media Server Upgrade. Before you can upgrade PMS, let me warn you first. DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! This is an ADVANCED configuration, and could void your warranty. Because this is advanced, I'm going to assume that you understand the technical terms described below. The instructions were taken from the Plex forums. Amazon unfortunately won't let me link directly to that page. I modified the original instructions, and the one below is what worked for me.Understand that the ReadyNAS 300 runs &#34;OS 6&#34;. First, TURN OFF your PMS app by going to the NAS' configuration page. Wait until it's confirmed to be turned off.a. Go to [Plex (dot) tv / downloads]. You will find a link there for &#34;NAS&#34;. Choose Netgear &#62; OS6 / Intel.b. Download the package -- it'll be a file called, &#34;plexmediaserver-ros6-binaries_versionnumber_amd64.deb&#34;c. Copy the download link of that file, and remove the &#34;-binaries&#34; part from the URL. The 2nd downloaded file should now be &#34;plexmediaserver-ros6_versionnumber_amd64.deb&#34;d. Copy the .deb packages via SSH/FileZilla to the NASe. From SSH, run the below command. Note that the &#34;-binaries&#34; file is the 2nd one:dpkg -i plexmediaserver-ros6_versionnumber_amd64.deb plexmediaserver-ros6-binaries_versionnumber_amd64.debIt will show you a few lines of output. You may see the activity light on your ReadyNAS start to flicker quite a bit, indicating that something is happening, especially when you already have PMS configured previously. On my ReadyNAS 300, it eventually appeared to freeze, but when I went back to the web configuration and checked the App version, it showed the new version that was just installed. I simply then SSH back into the NAS, re-ran the above dpkg -i command, and it completed this time (although with a couple errors.)Next, run the command:touch /apps/plexmediaserver/.localappVerify that the app version is the new one in the ReadyNAS administration page. You may now turn on the PMS app.Finally, launch Plex Media Server and configure the Transcode temporary folder to /apps/plexmediaserver/temp. You may have to turn on the Advanced Options to see the Transcode section.I have already performed 2 version upgrades with the above instructions without any problems. I also did this on the other ReadyNAS 300's.If all of this was useful for you, please be sure to click the &#34;Useful&#34; link on my review so that others can learn from this too.

{"title": "TV EARS works for me", "body": "Strengths:Easy to keep charged.Lets me compensate without turning the TV up loud.Convenient, as placing the device back in the charger keeps me from misplacing it.Replacement silicone earpieces are great.Easily lasts a listening day on single charge.Weaknesses:Earpieces it is supplied with made my ears sweat and were expensive to replace.When I eat or read or use laptop while listening, it is difficult to stay out of the way of the infrared beams that make the device work.The weight of the power and audio cords in the back of the little transmitter box tend to drag it back across the top of the TV set, making me have to reposition the box frequently.There is no balance control or mono switch for those who have lost hearing in one ear or who have large imbalance of hearing loss.Comments:The last weakness I've shown is actually the most important one. I lost hearing almost completely and suddenly from perfect hearing a few years ago. This device allows me to overcome the resulting tinnitus in that ear by supplying louder TV sound to the other ear, which still hears fine. My brain modulates the tinnitus when I hear sounds coming in the \"bad\" ear, so not having ability to make stereo into mono and channel all into the other ear is a weakness for me. For those with bilateral hearing loss, there is no difficulty with the device. I overcame this by wiring up an adapter sending both channels into my other ear and nothing into the \"bad\" one.The silicone earpieces are easily obtained and last for an indefinite period. I've already had mine almost a year. Do NOT remove the fiber ones until you are ready to replace them, as they are a one-use item. You cannot replace them on the earpieces once you pull them off.I liked the my first \"2.3 MHz\" unit so much that I obtained an additional one for my computer area, freeing me to move about while I listen to audio from the computer. I can listen late at night and not awaken my wife with the second unit.I noticed that the original (95 kHz) unit is still being sold by Amazon. But it mentions in the text: \"This system is not recommended for plasma or LCD screen televisions.\" AHA!

{"title": "Seems to hold stations better than others", "body": "Mounted on permanent site travel trailer approximately 70 miles from nearest TV station.  Original antenna worked but often could not hold stations in, especially during warmer weather.  First tried a Sensar IV head that was worse than the original antenna.  Jack antenna was easy to mount and seems to work better than original.  The only way to further improve the signal would be  to go with either satellite or a 5 foot TV antenna on a raised pole -- neither acceptable to me.  My one concern is the antenna seems to give better reception off the back end rather than the front end.  As I interpret the directions, the better signal seems to come off the back side.  Overall, the picture seems clearer and does hold longer into the day  than previous antennas -- but still not perfect and that I attribute to the distance from the TV stations", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Good sounding headphones with some design flaws", "body": "These are about the best \"in the ear\" headphones on the market right now from Sony. They sound pretty good but I used to have older sony \"fontopia\" headphones that sounded better with richer bass. My old ones costed $60 but are now discontinued. However, for the price, these are better bang for your buck. Here are the pros and cons:Pros: Good range of sound, especially for the price. Extra entension cord adapter is nice. 3 different ear adapters assure fit and comfort.Cons: The cord without the extender is a few inches too short. The cord with the extender is too long!Conclusion: For the price, these are worth every penny. They pretty much blow away other headphones in the same price/model range.However I wish they would make another model with even better audio range specs though... closer to the specs on DJ monitor type headphones. I wouldn't mind paying more to get better frequency range.  I would describe these as mid-range and NOT \"premium\" or high-end headphones. So true audiophiles may be disappointed.Note: The earphone cord design where one side is longer than the other is done on purpose. You are supposed to wear them with the cord behind your neck/head. Almost all of the Japanese headphones are now designed this way and it is not a design flaw.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Better than expected - WAYYYY better!", "body": "I was looking for a solution for a mid size living room without having to drill a lot of holes and/or having to run cables in visible areas. I saw this on sale, read the reviews and thought it was worth giving it a try. I put a high value on excellent quality, but with this purchase I was willing to compromise a lot for convenience (sound bar sitting right underneath the TV, connected with only the optical cable that is included in the box plus the cord from the power transformer - and the subwoofer is connected wirelessly). Delivery was very quick, setup very easy (actually so simple that I wasted most of the time to wonder about the \"missing\" remote control before I understood that I'm supposed to program my own to the device - this is actually a gain, seriously!!). Firing this system up for the first time really blew me away, and I'm picky. The sound is of course not equal to something balanced coming from a surround sound system in the four digit dollar area, but it sounds way way better than the price may suggest.After watching the first movie and enjoying clear and powerful sound, I decided to order the same set again for another room. Since the sets have a choice of four wireless channels for the sound bar to subwoofer connection, there's no danger that they might interfere with another. In the second room I even hid the subwoofer behind the sofa and it still sounds awesome. No problems whatsoever, I simply love it. And both systems even cost me less than what I spent for a single floor standing speaker.Now both systems are programmed to the remote controls that came with the TVs they are hooked up with. It's a matter of a minute to get this done, and it's so convenient. Couldn't be happier with a product that costs a fraction of what it sounds like.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Great for frequent flyers to keep your devices going, but missing some accessories", "body": "As a frequent flyer, I find my numerous battery powered devices need constant charge.  During connections in airports, I am always looking for the outlet (and often find myself working on the floor near the closest power outlet).  Thus, having a source of power to keep my iDevices running is essential.  I have been using the NewTrent PowerPack (5000mAH), but with only 1 USB port and limited current output, it wasn't able to charge my iPad, let alone multiple devices at once.  The EasyAcc 15000 mAh battery pack not only ups the power capability, but with 3 USB outputs, can charge my iPad, iPhone, and Bluetooth earpiece simultaneously.The EasyAcc battery weighs in at 13.3oz which is fine given the raw amount of charge it can store.  My existing 5000 mAh battery is 5 oz, so the weight is reasonable.  It is a nice shape - being relatively thin and vertical, it fits into a pocket in my travel bag quite easily.  with USB connectors on the top, I can route 3 charging cables directly out of the battery and into my devices.  The only port that could charge my iPad was the 2A port which was no surprise.  However, I used the other 2 ports to charge my iPhone 4 and my Plantronics Voyager Legend simultaneously.  All seemed to charge just fine, and I could even use my iPad while it charged.The battery comes with a huge number of adapter plugs.  I don't really have anything to take advantage of the 12V port, but there certainly are a bunch of small cables to use it with various devices as listed.  Not mentioned in the listing here is that there is also a 30-pin iPhone/iPad cable which worked just fine on my iPhone 4.  There is no lightning cable, so you will need to supply your own.A convenient 4 LED status bar shows you the amount of charge remaining.  The battery itself charges through a micro-USB port, but it does not include a wall outlet charging plug, so you will need to supply your own to charge the battery itself.So why 4 stars?  First, it works great and I do recommend it, but it does have some issues.  The included cases is only big enough to hold the accessories.  Given that there are 3 open USB ports on the device, I would have preferred it to ship with some sort of case to protect those ports from dust or debris while it is in my bag.  My other issue is that once the device you are charging is fully charged, the battery \"turns off\".  Then your device will start discharging normally, but the battery doesn't automatically turn back on.  If you use this to massively extend the charge life of a device by leaving it always connected, you could find your device totally discharged while the EasyAcc still has plenty of charge.  It would have been nice to have a manual \"keep this on\" switch.  I am also disappointed there is charging plug included for charging the battery.Otherwise, highly recommended and my new go-to device for charging my iPad on the go.Note: I was provided a free sample from the manufacturer for the purposes of review.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Very Cool MP3 Player - Highly recommended!!", "body": "After narrowing my choices down to the Zen Micro or IPod Mini, I read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding. I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings. When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro. The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player. After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened. I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'. One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly. A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device. However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already. After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation. I say get one today!!", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Simple Installation & Increased Signal Strength . . . .", "body": "Reading about all the features on this router makes me feel like it's wasted on my simple network--which consists of a laptop, a wired DVD player, and the Cisco RE1000 router extender.  But I'm very happy to have it, since I was using a g-router with more limited range.  I did have some fears about setting up the EA4500, since the Cox guy set up my network originally, and I know people who have Cox who have had trouble installing a new router.My fears were unfounded.  It could not have been easier installing this router with my Cisco modem.  I believe it took 15-20 minutes, and all I had to do was supply my network name and password.  Well, actually they give you a name and password you can use, and change at a later time, if you want.  You are also asked if you want to set up a second \"friend network\".  This is a network where people who come to your house, with their own Wi-Fi gadgets, can use like a public network.  They can't see your computer or access your files.  This friend network has a separate password, and you can choose the number of people who can be on it.  I thought that was interesting, so I created a friend network, but then saw it was an unsecure network, so I went back to turn it off.  Going back to change things with this router is easy, because a \"Cisco Connect\" program is created during installation, and it's right there from then on in your programs list.I was hoping the EA4500 would improve my signal strength upstairs in a room with poor reception, so I would not have to use the RE 1000 router extender, but it did not.  (In all the other rooms upstairs I did not need the extender, and got five bar signal strength, compared to three bars with the g-router.)  Using this N router with the router extender, however, increased the signal strength in the problem room from the two bars I got using the g-router to four bars.  It also made the router extender work every time, and much more quickly, with my wired Panasonic DVD player upstairs.  Thus, I'm happy with this new Linksys, and maybe I'll need some more of the many features of the EA4500 in the future.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Impressive Digital Picture Frame!", "body": "I&#8217;m writing this review about my new Nix X18B 18&#8221; digital photo frame.  I have had a lot of experience with digital picture frames (DPFs).  As I&#8217;m writing this, I&#8217;m looking at the remote controls of four DPFs that have failed over the years, and been replaced.  I&#8217;ve kept the remotes because I often replace a dead DPF by buying an identical new one.  Thus, the old remote will work on the new DPF - and is worth keeping.  I also threw out one more remote that failed.  So in total, I&#8217;ve bought at least five DPFs in the past.  It has been my experience that these things last about two years.  So, I probably have been buying these DPFs for about ten years.  That&#8217;s a long way of saying that I have a lot of experience with the hardware and software of these things.I was very impressed with the Nix DPF.  I looked at all of the parts, plugged everything in without reading the manual, plugged in my SD memory card, and turned it on.  Wow!  The device turned on, concluded that since I had plugged in an SD card filled with pictures (I took it out of my last, dead DPF), I probably wanted to display those pictures - and started displaying my pictures in a slide show.  Very nice!  This is the first DPF I&#8217;ve ever owned that made the radical assumption that I&#8217;d probably want to play all of the pictures on the SD card I inserted.  All of the other DPFs required me to go through a long process to teach them that fact - every morning.So far, I&#8217;ve only used the Nix X18B for one morning, but when I turned it on this morning, it again immediately started displaying my pictures.  Even better, it started displaying a different selection of my pictures then when I turned it on last night - so I don&#8217;t see the same pictures each time I turn it on.  Every other DPF had a &#8220;random&#8221; setting to shuffle my pictures, but they all displayed the same random selection of pictures every morning.  So each would start off by displaying, say, picture 100, 25, 300, 75, and 42 - every morning.  The Nix software doesn&#8217;t seem to do that.  &#8220;Random&#8221; really means &#8220;random&#8221;.  Wow!I did have one minor problem.  Nix gives you a four gig USB flash drive on which to store your pictures.  It didn&#8217;t register on my desktop when I plugged it into into one of the USB sockets in my Macintosh laptop computer.  I was trying to think of what could be wrong when I wondered if the flash drive was inserted upside down.  That turned out to be the problem.  When I reversed the drive and plugged it in again, it showed up - and I was able to copy my two gigs of pictures and video onto it.I had the same problem when I inserted this same USB flash drive into the Nix DPF.  It didn&#8217;t show up on the Nix&#8217;s desktop.  At first, I wondered if it was because the software wasn&#8217;t designed to have both a USB flash drive and an SD memory card inserted into the picture frame.  That wasn&#8217;t the case.  Again, it turned out that I had inserted the flash drive upside down.My complaint is that you should not be able to insert a USB flash drive into a computer - or DPF - upside down.  I&#8217;ve never had another USB drive or USB cable that I could insert upside down.I hang these DPFs onto the wall of my bathroom, and look at the pictures while I&#8217;m shaving each morning and brushing my teeth each night.  Thus, they are mounted about six feet up on the wall.  Many DPFs ago, I drilled holes in the wall, put plastic inserts and screws there, and tried to hang the DPF onto the screws by feel.  That&#8217;s surprisingly hard to do.  If your screws are off by even a fraction of an inch, you will find (as I did) that you can&#8217;t get the damn mounting holes on the frame to align with the screws.  It&#8217;s also very hard to even find the mounting holes on the back of the DPF when everything is out of sight and out of reach behind the thing.  I solved this problem by taking two wall-mounting picture hooks and connecting them with about a foot of picture-hanging wire.  I put the hooks in the mounting holes on the DPF, and hang the wire over the wall-mounted screws.  It allows me to hang one of these DPFs in seconds.  I&#8217;m surprised that a DPF manufacturer doesn&#8217;t include one with the product.Send me an e-mail (Moi@BobLeahy.com), and I&#8217;ll send you a picture of my setup.  It really will make your life a lot easier.I have found that these DPFs last about two years, so don&#8217;t think, &#8220;I won&#8217;t bother.  I&#8217;ll hang the blasted thing up on the wall screws and never have to think about it again.&#8221;  Wrong!  It will take you a lot of work (1) to drill the wall screws EXACTLY the RIGHT distance apart, (2) to try to get the wall screws to line up with the DPF mounting holes - when you can&#8217;t see or feel them, and (3) you&#8217;re probably going to have to do this again in two years.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Good sound, good design", "body": "Finally, a product that has what I'm looking for!!! This just arrived yesterday and I love it. Turned it on, paired with my phone in about 10 seconds, and started playing music right away!Pros1) The solar panel is pretty big and seems to work well for charging small devices. Gonna see how quickly it charges my iPad...a slightly bigger draw.2) I love that it has a USB port and not an iPod specific port like some iPod docks, so you can charge any low power USB device from it.3) You can turn charging on and off while a device is connected (so it won't charge if you don't want it to; and you can use the Bluetooth connected device while another device is plugged in and charging.4) It's pretty small, lightweight, and easy to carry (even though it comes in a box way too big for it's size).5) Some reviewers have said the speakers were weak. I haven't played it outside but in my house it was pretty darn loud and the base was decent. I will update when I come back from a beach trip next week.6) The Bluetooth range is about 40 feet or so line-of-sight, a little less with walls in the way, so you can keep your \"player\" in your pocket and use it as a remote.Cons1) The one thing I'd love for this to have is a water-resistant and dust-resistant design like the Eton Soulra.2) The design of the iPod compartment leaves a little to be desired; it is only a black elastic strap, not very secure especially for small iPods.3) Not sure how scratch resistant the solar panel is, I'm leaving the protective cover on for now. I might decide to put an iPad screen protector on it, trimmed to size.4) It doesn't have an AM/FM tuner. I'm really tired of companies not making products with tuners...the circuitry is so simple now...just put it in. That goes for Apple's products as well. I'm not going to \"stream\" everything over my data connections when the AM/FM airwaves are all around me.********* I will update with any new findings after my next 2 weeks of use. ***********Update 8/30/2012The sound is not LOUD, but it is definitely loud enough for it's purpose, which is a decent set of speakers that you can play in your vicinity and never run out of power (ahem...during the day). It was certainly loud enough for what I had it for, which was to play some tunes while sailing down the Chesapeake Bay and lounging on the beach. You will not be able to throw a party with just this little guy...but for two 2-inch speakers...it worked just fine.*********Update 9/17/2012I've discovered a few quirks that are worth sharing.1) It seems that you cannot turn off the Bluetooth. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, but it's constantly on when the unit is on. Update: I did figure out how to turn the Bluetooth off...it was just confusing me for a bit.2) The charging takes quite a long time. It has a fairly large battery so you can fully charge your phone and play for a few hours, but the solar panel takes a good bit of time to charge this battery back up. This is compounded by a quirk in the software that causes intermittent charging. When you place the unit in the sunlight, it doesn't automatically start charging; you have to push the power button to turn it on for it to start charging. This is a problem because if you're just charging it and not using it, you want to turn it off so that the system is not on draining your battery. When you push the power button again, it does indeed turn off and continue to charge UNTIL the sun fades for longer than about 1/2 a second, after which it does not continue charging. So, if a cloud rolls by or you cast your shadow over it by walking in front of it, it will stop charging and not come back on and you won't know it. You have to cycle the power button to get it to start charging again. This is a disappointing design to me; you would think that anytime it has light, it would attempt to capture that automatically by charging, but this is not what happens. This means unless you place the unit in direct cloudless sunlight, you have to nurse it the whole time.3) USB connection - This is a more minor one for me, but you cannot hook your device up to the unit with USB in order to play music. The USB is a CHARGE ONLY port, it does not do data transfer. This also means that either Bluetooth or analog stereo-mini jack is the only way to play audio.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Not Ready for Prime Time?", "body": "I bought the 2 GB model because the 4 GB version wasn't available yet and it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs. The 4 GB version is identical except for the amount of installed flash memory.Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called \"firmware\") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the \"safe disconnect\" icon is often times not even in the system tray.If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk (\"ripping the songs\"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or \"podcasts\" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Masterwork Keyboard of +2 to Intimidate", "body": "First and foremost, this is my first mechanical keyboard. I do not have experience with any other switches, though after significant amounts of research and such, I decided to go with a cherry mx brown switch.The keys on this keyboard do not audibly click when you press down on the keys, but if you &#34;bottom out&#34; (I do believe that's the term), then you can achieve a very &#34;clicky&#34; effect. As is noted above, the keys are unlabeled, but as a touch typist I actually like this format.While I cannot really vouch for the durability of this keyboard, having had it only for a few weeks, I can say that all of my keys still work wonderfully. Additionally, if it's really anything to note, the response time on this keyboard is simply astounding. Unlike even the pinnacle of laptop keyboards (Lenovo), it registers every keystroke I make. This essentially means that keysmashing in my skype IM chats turns out a block of text so incredibly quickly to emulate the frustrated or overly excited emotions I harbor at that moment.In the box with the keyboard comes a small black cloth which I assumed is to be used to clean off the keyboard. Even though it's very good for wiping down the exterior, a significant amount of dust has already accumulated underneath the keys or on the keys where it's difficult to wipe down. Also included is the keyboard itself, which is USB plug-in. The instructions for installation are more just a formality - it's all plug-and-play and comes with a USB to PS/2 adapter (Although to use Full n-key rollover, the PS/2 adapter must be used. I'll be honest - I have no idea what full n-key rollover really means).As for the form and function of the rest of the keyboard, it's really quite simplistic. One of my only complaints is that the keyboard's USB cable is split at the end into the cable for the keyboard, and the cable for the USB hub, which I imagine would likely be intended for if a person wanted to use the PS/2 adapter. The second of two complaints I have is that the &#34;lock&#34; lights (e.g. CAPS LOCK, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock, do not shut out light from the LED completely. As a result, the lights each are bright in the center with the symbol, with light radiating out from edges of what appears to be a sloppily placed black rectangle (These lights and &#34;rectangles&#34; are all below the surface of the keyboard, so you don't actually see them. The keyboard itself is very sleek). This is a very minor cosmetic complaint, but that's pretty much it.One possible thing people might not appreciate is the lack of a wrist-rest. I personally don't mind the lack of a place to rest my wrists while I'm typing, I'm sure if you're willing to shell out the money for a mechanical keyboard you can afford a decent wrist rest. Or just use a sock filled with rice.tl;dr: This keyboard is amazing, and I really only have two incredibly minor complaints about it that don't really even matter in the end. I'm definitely happy with this purchase and now cringe whenever using something other than a mechanical keyboard.", "rating": "pos"}

I think the Atlantic is a slightly better design than the 100 and, on a per disc cost basis, it is a much better value at Amazon.Functionally, there is nothing to choose between them. The Atlantic was better packed. I had one Selector 100 arrive damaged due to shoddy packing. Many people have had that experience.Buy the Atlantic DiscManager 80...better value and same function as Discgear 80S. Shorter warranty, though, 1 year vs. \"lifetime\".A tip on printing labels with the MyDiscGear web tool: select \"Selector 80S\" as your unit type and when you print make sure your print driver is set to \"actual size\". Otherwise, your print driver may blow up the label to full page size and it will, of course, be too big to fit.Great product and fantastic Amazon price.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "A Recovery Enclosure", "body": "I used this enclosure to recover files from a friend's seriously fragged HD. I already had Data Rescue 3 from when I had to recover files from my drive, so all I needed was a way to interface with their drive. This little gem was exactly what I needed: a fast, bus-powered connection at an relatively low price point.To install a SATA drive, there are two screws in back to take out, and then a slim sled pulls out of the enclosure. The product comes with four screws to affix your drive to sled, and slide it back in and attach the two outer screws. You may need a smaller set of phillips screw drivers, but you can pick those up at radio shack for less than $5.As I said before, the drive was really messed up mechanically, so recovery of just personal files took days. However, the fact that the drive has USB2, FW400, AND FW800 was a total plus. I did my first work with it using FW800 looking for the fastest speed possible. However, after it became apparent that due to the drive transfers would be slow, no matter what transfer method I used, I switched to 400.The only down side to the drive enclosure, I'll say, is that it sucks a *lot* of power. The recovery process was only pulling 25% of my available CPU, so I tried do other tasks with FireWire peripherals at the same time. Well, my FW400 optical drive kept loosing power and spinning down after an hour or so of use when used concurrently with this drive doing data recovery. I never had any problems with my FW400 Audio & MIDI I/O box, but that probably didn't require as much power. As a disclaimer, this may have been the function of my particular system setup.If you're looking for a cheap and effective SATA drive enclosure, specifically with FireWire connectivity, I'd recommend this to most anyone in a heartbeat.", "rating": "pos"}

I have 5 USB 3.0 external hard drives plugged into it. Some are 2 TB and some are 3 TB. If you are interested in the details, please read on.I have several USB 3.0 external hard drives (mainly for use with my video editing hobby).  I have long wanted a USB 3.0 hub because of only having two USB 3.0 ports available via a PCI Express card (my motherboard has no native 3.0 ports.)  I bought a 3.0 hub several months ago (not a Plugable brand) and found that the drives were being dropped frequently (i.e. Windows 7 could no longer see them.) I had to disconnect the drive's power plug and reconnect it so that Windows could re-discover the drive.  Then a day or two later, the problem would re-occur. Sometimes the problem would occur more than once per day.  Before buying that hub, I knew from reading reviews that dropped drives was a frequent complaint about 3.0 hubs, but decided to try my luck since some people had success with them. But no success for me, so I returned the hub to Amazon.Recently I started looking at hub reviews again to see if the state of the technology has improved.  I was encouraged by the mention of a new VIA chipset, which this hub and a few others have.  I saw the Plugable brand on Amazon and was drawn to it by two things:  1) excellent reviews  2) The Plugable name.  I had an experience with a Plugable product about a year ago. I was having a problem and Plugable provided outstanding support.  Plugable support answered my e-mails very quickly and worked hard to diagnose the problem.  After an exchange of e-mails for several days, it turned out that the problem was not caused by the Plugable product. It was caused by a flaky slot in my motherboard.  But their rapid response to my inquiries made a positive impression.  So I ordered this USB 3.0 hub.Upon arrival, I connected the hub to one of the ports of the USB 3.0 card and connected 5 USB 3.0 external hard drives to the hub.  Windows discovered all 5 drives.  It has been four days so far and none of the drives has been dropped.  I'll update this review if a problem develops, but so far, so good.  I am enjoying the increased speed that USB 3.0 provides compared to what I was getting when these drives were connected to a USB 2.0 hub.It's only been four days, but I am hopeful that I won't experience the dropped drive problem.  I am confident that if I do have a problem, I can count on outstanding support from Plugable. (Since I keep mentioning Plugable support, in case anyone wonders, I am not an employee of Plugable or connected with them in any way. I'm just a customer who had a very good experience with them. I find that good customer support is the exception these days, so I tend to be loyal to those few companies that do provide good support.)Pros:1) It works!  That should be a given with any product, but in the case of USB 3.0 hubs, it is not a given.2) 7 USB 3.0 ports.3) The supplied power supply has a long cord, which I needed because the closest electrical outlet is quite a long distance from my PC.4) A USB 3.0 cable is included.5) It's a nice looking unit. That's not particularly important to me, but it may be to some people.Cons:None that I have found so far.UPDATE on October 25, 2013:  I purchased another of these hubs.  Amazon doesn't provide a way to review the product a 2nd time so I am editing my original review.My original Plugable USB 3.0 hub continued to work well, but all 7 ports were in use and I needed more.  I checked with Plugable support to ask them if a 2nd hub would work when connected to the original hub.  They relied quickly saying it would work and recommended connecting the new hub to port 5, 6, or 7 of the original hub. So I ordered another of these hubs. After receiving it, I disconnected an external hard drive from port 7 of the original hub to free up a port.  I connected the new hub to port 7 and connected the external hard drive to a port on the new hub.  It worked fine at USB 3.0 speed.  So anyone wondering if you can plug a USB 3.0 hub into another USB 3.0 hub, it does work well.  At least it does with these Plugable hubs.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Fine Android speakers", "body": "This cute Android set of quality hi-fi external speakers on my desk tells colleagues and office visitors that Android has delivered me from Apple's proprietary clutches and its irritating itunes straitjacket. The only features that could be further improved on this fine set of speakers would be to make (a) the ON/OFF switch easier to reach and move and (b) make the 3.5mm audio plug cable longer. I would advise future buyers (and present users) to use a smartphone wall charger to power/charge these speakers to avoid blocking a valuable USB port on their laptops merely for powering/charging these speakers. Finally, to prevent needless frustration, please note that the included Micro-USB cable serves only to charge the speakers. As it looks similar to those sold with smartphones, (except that it's narrower), one may unknowingly try to use it to transfer data from device to device.

{"title": "Overall, a very good TN-type display, especially as a computer monitor", "body": "This is a long review, so I'll start with a summary:Pros:  Excellent as a general purpose computer monitor.  Built-in speakers are quite usable despite being very small and hidden.  Bright display.  A fair set of available adjustments to improve picture quality.  Good image uniformity for a TN panel.  Minimal gradient dithering.  No stuck pixels on mine.  Backlit remote control.  A good set of inputs for a small TV.Cons:  Only minor things.  As a TN panel, this display is best viewed from above center when you are sitting close to it.  The MagicAngle feature makes it possible to view the display correctly from lower angles, but alters gamma significantly and can adversely affect picture quality.  No DVI port.  No printed manual (digital copy only).  Input/output ports are on the back of the display and so can be hard to access.  Very high speaker volumes (tested in PC mode) communicate video or computer noise through the speakers.  LED-lit panel shows clouding except when viewed close up.Not tested by me:  The TV's handling of audio over HDMI.  (This TV might not pass it to its speakers.)  Some advanced image adjustments and other functions of this display such as the built-in TV tuner and the component video connections.  Input lag (I assume it's very low).I bought this monitor to be used mainly as a computer display at 1920x1080.  It's just the right size for me and produces a beautiful picture with crisp, clear text and good-looking, surprisingly uniform colors/whites.  The following picture settings work best for me:Mode:  StandardBacklight:  10Contrast:  82Brightness:  45Sharpness:  50Picture Options:  Color Tone = Warm1.A completely black screen shows little to no light bleed, but does show clouding at greater viewing distances.  Since this display uses a TN panel, black and white become gold-colored at off-center viewing angles.  I sit 34\" from the display, where this already begins to be noticeable on a black screen.  I find this perfectly acceptable, since uniformity looks great otherwise.  Fortunately, even at very steep horizontal viewing angles, normal images lose only a negligible amount of their vibrancy and purity. This is also the case when looking down at the monitor from above.  It is only when looking up at any part of the monitor that uniformity of color and brightness noticeably degrade.For best possible image quality, I either (a) lower the monitor 1 or 2 inches below eye level at a 34\" viewing distance, (b) raise the gamma (under Advanced picture options), or (c) set Samsung's MagicAngle feature to Lean Back Mode.  Option (c) goes beyond merely altering the gamma to lighten or darken the image.  Fortunately, in PC mode, adjusting the brightness can at least correct the black level.  Unfortunately, black levels can't be recovered when using HDMI.Calibrating the TV with a Blu-ray player over HDMI yields the following picture settings:Mode:  MovieBacklight:  10Contrast:  82Brightness:  45Sharpness:  0Color:  51Tint:  R48/G52Picture Options:  Color Tone = Warm1.To my eyes, the grayscale looks fantastic.  Raising the gamma setting can improve very light and dark image detail, since red and especially blue show some crushing in calibration test patterns.  Again, this also improves low vertical viewing angles without having to resort to MagicAngle.With MagicAngle off, black levels are OK for an LCD TV.  Image detail is decent.  As in PC mode, there is very little color distortion at extreme viewing angles except when looking up from below the screen.  As a further demonstration of how much better TN panels are these days, gradient test patterns show almost no dithering at all.  I don't have the means to test color accuracy, but can't find any reason to complain about it.The built-in speakers are very small but capable.  They are working surprisingly well for me in Movie mode.  I am happy having the volume set at just 10% most of the time.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test sound over HDMI.  I haven't browsed the manual to see how the TV handles it, if it handles it at all.Although it's a little expensive for my needs, I'm happy that I bought this display and am not bothered by its shortcomings.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Blu Ray player that works", "body": "I've had this unit a day or so, and watched 3 movies. So it's not a comprehensive review by any means but here's what I found.a) the picture is almost as good as the Toshiba HDA20 I have, but it seems the HD DVD has the edge on action scenes. The Blu Ray seems to have some artifacts, noticed this the most on \"Layer Cake\"I did try to switch to the 24 fps mode, but the player refused to do so, even though I have a 1080p Scepter TV. This might be the TV as it was their first 1080p set.b) the complaint about the missing ether net port holds no basis, in the manual they describe needing to download and burn a CD with the updates. Since you'd need internet either way and a CD costs a few cents.. not a problem.c) compared to the horror stories I've heard about the first couple of generations of sony machines this baby boots up almost right away, faster than the HDA20. It does seem to sit and think between menu selections, which the HD discs don't do.. but it's not really a problem.Price is high compared to other machines, but this one works fine.Right now it's 4 stars as I don't know if the 24fps is going to work and it's a bit pricey, other wise I'd say 5************************** some time later *****************************The 24fps works like a dream with the samsung tv. It's certainly the way to view Blu Ray that has this option. Once set up the TV automatically adjusts when 24fps is detected.

If you are looking for a sub to blow you away though, you need to buy yourself a dedicated sub.The headphone cable and a custom cable come out of the volume knob.  One plugs into your device, the other into the sub.  The sub then has an stereo jack for unamplified speakers.  You plug the satellites into that.

The smaller pocket is good for my extra battery, and you could probably fit another battery in there though I only have one.Even with all the zippers open, things don't fall out of this case when I have it hanging from a belt or beltloop, which is great cause I like to quickly take the camera out and put it back in without zipping it up all the way when walking around (I don't unzip it all the way though), or I'll completely forget that I've unzipped the front pocket.This comes with both a belt loop on the middle back and a carabiner on the smaller loop at the top. I don't really use the belt loop cause I like to be able to take the whole case off my hip, but it's better to use that if you don't want it swinging around while you walk.

{"title": "I'm very happy with my new case", "body": "I received the case and to my surprise the product looked better than in the pictures.The previous model that I had (NT31B) and the rubber case it came with for protection felt a bit loose for the case, however the protection was great. That was the first thing I liked about my new case. The protective &#34;rubber&#34; that goes on top of the plastic casing feels more robust and seems to be able to hold a bit more of abuse than the one on my older NT31B. Whatever the material is that was used I really like it.Weight wise, this does obviously make the iPad mini feel bulkier but for the extra protection that I am getting I think it's worth it, nevertheless, compared to the weight of the NT31B (without the keyboard) the feeling is that this Air Bender NT620GR is lighter.The leather strap is very useful for my work conditions as I have to carry the iPad mini almost everywhere I go and take small notes so it makes it easier to carry and pull up for typing a few words, the peace of mind is greater with the strap as it adds an additional sense of security because not only the case is sturdy but the risk of dropping it is way lesser with the strap. I liked also the little stand that allows the iPad to be put in either landscape or vertical mode. I haven't used that feature too much but it does feel like it could resist some good and tough use if needed (which normally it would not happen when you use a stand).The front cover is barely noticeable and it does not get too dirty with fingerprints -although that is something almost inevitable-.Overall I already like my previous case with the included Bluetooth keyboard, but for what I need to use my iPad for right now, this feels like an upgrade. I give this a 5 star rating based on the quality that it has, the nice and stylish feel and look, and the added convenience of the strap, the stand, and the peace of mind that my little iPad will be protected against a lot of dangers including spills, rain, dust, some kids and some adults as well. To make this an even greater product, it would be awesome that you could detach the leather strap and attach the Bluetooth from the other case seamlessly.The posted pictures don't allow to show the case in all its glory.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Working well, but missing some important niceties...", "body": "The unit has some weight to it, and the enclosure has a slight tacky touch, which prevents slipping out of your hand. It comes with a mesh pouch, nice touch there for us traveling folks. I am not so thrilled about the shaking function to activate the charger; I would rather just have a plain on-off switch. It holds charge very well and is capable of charging multiple products all at once. It cannot be charged while charging other devices, which I thought it's odd and not very convenient. The lack of this feature knocks a star out of the gate. I note that if I charge my Bose BT headset by alone, the charger would turn off after a while, even though the Bose has not been fully charged... I think that there must be is a minimum load on the charger to keep it up and running. The Bose really draws very little current, and unless I keep shaking the charger from time to time, I will not get my Bose to be fully charged. This goes away if I connect additional devices to the charger... then everything gets charged fully... the unit will eventually turns itself off, but at that point, I am not sure if the charger goes into trickle charge or it just turns off....What I like: multi-ports to charge multi devices; well built; carrying pouchWhat I don't like: shaking function to activate; different current rating for different ports (Anker should just use the IQ technology and distribute the power to the ports on demand and as needed, like all other products they make)", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Easy, sounds good, but make sure you understand what it is", "body": "I'm impressed with the Sonos system so far.What I like:- The system is wireless. Despite other reviewers' moans, having a Bridge attached to a router, and the rest of the system wireless, is extremely impressive to me.- The Play:5 has fine sound quality for casual listening or having a party.- Setup was easy.- The system syncs all speakers (HUGE selling point).- The system can play different sources on each speaker, with a central control interface (also a big selling point).- I can control the whole system, zone by zone or grouped into zones, via my iPad, iPhone, or laptop.The only disappointment is that dozens of users have written negative reviews claiming that Sonos is falsely advertising...the users clearly didn't take the time to research an expensive purchase.I did my research, and it was very clear that I needed a Bridge connected to my router. Amazon happened to be offering a free Bridge with a Play:5 purchase, so no sweat there. Sonos could offer each of its speaker units with a built-in full wireless card to access a 802.11 network, but that's ridiculous in terms of cost and complexity.As for setup, I plugged the Bridge into my router in my equipment room, plugged in the Play:5 in the living room, and with minor setup was rewarded with very good (not excellent, but very good) sound, an intuitive control interface, and more music options than I'll ever use. I primarily listen to Pandora and radio--Sonos offers access to a library of 1000s of radio stations from around the world.This system is not cheap. I also don't love having ~$1500 into a bunch of proprietary hardware and software. But nothing else on the market does what Sonos does. If you want flexible whole-house music - for dinner parties, for example - and you don't want to wire or rewire your house, and if you want to be able to stream nearly anything while controlling it from your mobile device or computer, this is a fantastic system. If you're just looking to play tunes off your iPhone in one or two rooms separately, don't buy this--buy a stand-alone dock.", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "No matter how often you charge your Kindle battery sooner or later oops -- I forgot!", "body": "When you have four items to charge and only one outlet available, a fast charge is generally appreciated and is certainly safer than a rats' nest of extension cords, multiple plug gizmos, and wires all over the place.  Do keep in mind that the PowerFast is a medium to large sized block so be sure you have the space to park it in the outlet(s) you intend using it in.You will need a cord from the power block to your Kindle, and believe me that you want a long cord so you can find a good place to set your Kindle or alternatively use the Kindle as it charges.  I was more than a bit disappointed over not finding such a cord bundled in, so I separately bought a nice long cord and have had no problems thus far.Do keep reality in mind however.  Accelerate Charging reduces your charge time.  But you won't charge your completely run down Kindle battery in 30 minutes.

{"title": "Great Stereo bluetooth headphones for the workout fanatic", "body": "This nice little gadget is a great buy for anyone who likes to go running, biking, weight lifting without the nuisance of normal headphone cords tugging out the ear buds.  The lack of any wires to connect to anything is obviously what makes these a bluetooth device, but their is little sound quality loss due to the through air signal transmission.  Some might say that a hard line will give you better sound, but these sound pretty good despite that.  As headphones, these gizmos are top notch.  Though there could be more bass even when the 'super' base mode is turned on.As a microphone, its a slightly different story.  If you are in a car, forget trying to talk to anyone, unless your car has zero traveling noise.  These work best in a very quiet environment, which I think is due to the location of the microphone (it is not very close to your mouth but rather by your left ear).  I work in a chemistry lab and find that people have a hard time hearing me over the various contraptions causing background noise.  I myself have had a friend call me on their phone while they were using my phone and backbeats and I thought it sounded quite good.  The odd thing that time is that it was at a restaurant/bar that was mildly loud and her voice was quite clear and loud.A couple of the major drawbacks in terms of function are that they can be a bit tough to get onto the ears in the first place.  And if you wear glasses that have super tiny rims, their is a space conflict between the glasses and the head phones themselves.  I have also found that the bluetooth randomly just doesnt turn on.  This is easily fixed by holding the power button down and THEN plugging in the charger; it is the reset protocol found in the manual.  Pairing the backbeats to the bluetooth music adapter is a bit of a hassle as well since it seems like you have to pair it to it after every time you charge the blue tooth adapter.Pros:Great SoundGood for working out - running, biking, lifting, sumo wrestling, etcGood battery life (~5-7 hours of actual talk time, several days in standy)Can switch from music to a phone call with one click of the right ear buttonSeemingly durableGood sound quality with phone callsCons:Doesnt work well with glassesRandomly wont turn on, needs a resetPairing to bluetooth adapter after every charge of the adapterMicrophone quality is a bit lacking when various types of seemingly innocuous background noise is presentBass could be strongerI would recommend these to a friend", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "iSmooth clear screen protectors for S3 phone", "body": "These arrived very promptly. I watched a couple YouTube videos on how to apply screen protectors without dust and bubbles, and then went to work. I used a bathroom counter wiped off with a clean damp towel, for a low-dust workspace. The Galaxy S3 phones (Verizon) had flimsy factory-applied screen protectors. I removed those, and then spent several minutes per phone (a) polishing the glass with lens cleaner liquid applied to a microfiber lens cloth (DON\"T squirt liquid directly on your phone!), and (b) using a short piece of Scotch tape to dab around the screen edges and phone buttons to remove any dust particles that might have settled there. I then pulled back the bottom cover sheet (labelled 1) about 1/3 of the way and carefully aligned the screen cover edges, starting at the bottom. I used a rectangle of plastic shaped like a small credit card to push air bubbles out from underneath the screen protector and check for dust particles. When I found one, I would slowly pull back the protector and reach in with the Scotch tape to snag the particle, which was sometimes on the protector, rather than on the glass. Then I uncovered another third of the protector and continued. And again. GO SLOWLY. If you peel the adhesive sheet off quickly, you will induce a static electricity charge on the protector, and it will grab dust out of the air. NOTE: the plastic smoothing tool, which is CRITICAL to this job, was NOT included in the kit - hence only four stars. A smooth-edged (run your fingers along it to check for roughness) credit card will probably work but is a bit large for a phone screen. Both phones came out close to perfect. No dust or air bubbles, and a nice clear, shiny protective cover on the screen. The cover does not affect the screen sensitivity to taps and swipes. I wish the cover adhered a bit better to the curved edges of the glass, but it is acceptable. The cutouts and size were perfect for the Samsung Galaxy S3, and left just enough clearance at the edges to install a phone cover like an Otterbox or a BodyGlove Dropbox. The cover of course acquires fingerprints, but I have been able to restore the clean shiny surface with a lens cleaner-moistened microfiber wiper cloth. I think paper tissues or paper towels will eventually scratch the plastic; microfiber is probably your best bet. So far, I am totally happy with these covers.", "rating": "pos"}

For my setup, it's way better than if the volume control were on the speakers themselves. It's given me much more flexibility with my set up.And of course, what about the sound?

I replaced a set of Dell speakers that kept making popping noises, and these speakers were just as good (if not better) than my old speakers (and were a fraction of the price!)If you're looking for a small set of speakers with a price to match - these sound good and produce enough volume to get a 5-star rating from me!

This is meant for on-the-go travelers who have devices that run on battery already (i.e. MP3 players, digital cameras, etc.). This transfer box is also rare because is supports USB mass storage specifications AND PTP protocol! This means that some Canon and Sony cameras which normally require drivers to work will function with the Alera! Another cool thing is that you can hook up to 4 devices (2 camera cards, 2 USB devices) and copy/delete between them all! You can select individual files and have them copied to a folder created by the Alera (something screen-less boxes can't do). If hooked up to a PC the Alera will function as an 8-in-1 card reader as well. The unit is a little bit bigger than I expected (not much) and is made of plastic.

You know those jokes about people using their CD Rom Drives as cupholders?  Yup, that's them.Why has it taken so long for companies to send routers out with the default being \"Secure\" rather than \"open?\"  Glad that Belkin figured it out - This router comes with WPA enabled and the unique password printed a card taped to the router.  By the way, WPA is a lot more secure than the older WEP technology.I made a point of writing the password on the router itself with a paint marker so my in-laws couldn't lose it.  Other than that, this router was up and running 30 seconds after being out of the box and everyone was able to connect to it quickly and easily.  Streaming videos over their ComCrap broadband connection was fine. No need to install, firware update, or anything.

{"title": "One strap to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them", "body": "I'll preface this by saying I'm an amateur photog and not a professional.  Prior to this strap I'd only ever used neck straps, but prolonged usage would always leave the back of my neck feeling raw. I did some research into alternatives and chose this based on it being a shoulder strap with a pad and I really liked how sturdy the attaching mechanism looked to attach it to my camera. This strap did not disappoint. It feels ultra comfortable when I use this thing for hours and I've never worried about my camera falling off from it. The fastenr attachment mechanism really is fantastic. It feels rock solid and securely fastens to my Nikon J1. With its rubber washer, it doesn't mark up the camera bottom either.Anyways, back to the strap. It's made of ballistic nylon which makes it pretty rugged and after months of owning it with moderate use, it still looks like I just took it out of the box. I think the only downside for me is that the shoulder pad makes it a little bulky when I just want to quickly stash it (mirrorless cameras have a pretty low profile) but it's something I can live with considering the other benefits. Great strap. I've already recommended it to all my friends. A bit pricey, but I definitely feel like it's worth it.", "rating": "pos"}

I had no trouble in getting the camera to work with my equipment.The image from the camera is not very good.  However, it is more than sufficient to be able to tell who is standing at the front door.I realize that this camera was not designed for outdoor use.

{"title": "She Offered Her Honor (Groucho)", "body": "This is my first DVD Recorder, yes I had at first planned to get the ES10S as, except for the \"Firewire\" input I did not see much advantage on paper. They go for about $160 but no one seems to have them in stock?I have too many DVD players but what I wanted was a unit to function as a DVD (VCR) so as to have the ability to record some TV show when I'm not home or certain events. Having the ability to use the RAM Disc for \"Chasing Playback\" seems very cool. My very nice but older Toshiba simply would not play the DVD R+ I made, which is what placed it on the chopping block. On the plus side, I hooked this unit up to my very old RCA big screen. The entire remote had gone out on this TV. Due to the age I did not want to invest to repair this \"older\" technology, we had just been using this TV for movies as the remote (in the TV) was out. The Pansaonics tuner can be used to run the whole system. So aside from turning on the TV, I can use the DVD remote to watch normal cable TV, watch the VCR, watch a movie, or of course, chase the playback and the unit plays ALL my DVD's, well my zone one DVD anyway. I have not used it all that much which is why I felt I could not go to 5 stars -so it's a report and not an in depth review. I did try out the Chasing Playback, very easy to do, works well. I made a bootleg of an educational VCR tape--a bit more involved as you have to \"close\" a DVD so it will play on other DVD players but it did work. Although the DVD RAM are more expensive, Circuit City had 5 Panasonic DVD RAM disc for $10 so for my expected uses of this system I'm set for a modest fee. Amazon does have this unit cheaper than anywhere else I looked by about $15 ($185)BUT I came across a coupon on Amazon that states \"Spend $129 on Panasonic, Get $50 Off a Future Purchase at Amazon.com\" I don't know if they will honor this offer but I bought my unit 10/6 and it says for purchases between 10/1 to 10/31 2005 so that would make this about a $135 purchase which would be very cool!", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Good DVR Monitoring system for mostly indoor use", "body": "The Defender SN502-4CH-002 is a fairly solid product.Outdoors, even though the cameras are indoor/outdoor, the documentation explains that the cameras should not be placed where they are fully exposed to the weather.

IF you want it to look nice, without wires hanging out, you may want some help, especially in routing the wire from outside to inside.  And you will likely need a lot more wire than is included, luckily, Defender sells the cables to extend and connect to the existing cables.  Unfortunately, not all of us are as handy as we should be with tools, especially when the goal is to make things look nice.One thing I would have liked to see is the ability to be more modular - to add your own cameras, different cameras, or even hook the box to a wireless router. Pretty much you are locked into the Defender box, so to speak.  Still, for a starter \"Security Monitor in a Box\", this is a better than average choice.Also note that I could not make it hook up to my older Android phone, and I don't have an iPhone or Blackberry so I cannot comment on the phone feature.

{"title": "USB 3.0 is 2.5x faster than USB 2.0, plus technical specs provided by Asus", "body": "I ran one experiment to confirm that USB 3.0 really is about 2.5x faster (as some web sites claim) to burn Blu-ray Discs (BD-R) than USB 2.0 (ie. the USB channel is the bottleneck, not the disk or cpu speed). Using an ASUS laptop with an i7 cpu, a USB 3.0 port and 4GB memory, I backed up 22.3 GB of data (5,339 files) to a BD-R at 12x maximum write speed using the included ASUS/Cyberlink Media Suite program Power2Go 7. It took 01:00 minute for Power2Go to \"prepare\" the data for writing (these times are not rounded off, though they coincidentally look like they are).Actual write time to write 22.3GB to BD-R(SL) at 12x:-- USB 3.0 : 11:00 minutes -- 2.0 GB/min or 120 GB/hr-- USB 2.0 : 30:30 minutes -- 0.73 GB/min or 44 GB/hrFor this experiment, USB 3.0 wrote data 2.7x faster than USB 2.0.For another experiment, the measured write speed for a BD-R(DL) disc was 90 GB/hr (38.0GB at 8x).Using this BD writer, so far I have written 7 BD-R(DL) disks at the max 8x and 4 BD-R disks at the max 12x speed without any problems, even though BD-R(SL/DL) Verbatim media is only rated for 6x speed. I also confirmed the 16x write speed to DVD+R media.Currently Verbatim 25GB BD-R discs cost about $2/disc (getting close to the price per GB of DVD discs!) and 50GB discs are about $7/disc. Prices will continue to fall.===============Summary of hardware:-- this Blu-Ray Writer (Burner) is among the fastest available at this time-- USB 3.0 currently distinguishes this product from its competition-- writes DVDs and CDs like other BD writers-- ASUS is an excellent leading-edge brand-- Software [Windows-only]:----- free Cyberlink Media Suite, which contains minimal-feature versions of these programs (until you upgrade to paid versions):Cyberlink Power2Go 7Cyberlink PowerDVD 10 with Magic CinemaCyberlink PowerBackup 2.5Cyberlink InstantBurn 5-- I discovered a hard-to-see On/Off switch (doesn't exist for DVD writers) on the back when it didn't appear to work :-)-- Color:  Black-- Length:  9.5\"-- Width:  6.5\"-- Height:  2.4\"-- Weight:  2.5 lbs.==========Software notes:-- This hardware is great. But the included Power2Go software has some problems -- 1 fatal error and 2 other serious bugs were found on day 1 of use. I recommend the really free ImgBurn software (no annoying paid-upgrade notices) which is a pleasure to use, is continuously being improved (unlike Power2Go, which is at end-of-life), and has an active and easily used forum site. Plus it works on Ubuntu linux.-- None of the 4 programs I tried (Power2Go, ImgBurn, Blu-ray Creator, Windows cut-and-paste) were able to successfully backup all files from my in-use C: drive without fatal errors and early exit (update: FBackup uses VSS and can do it). Even when files in use are set to be ignored by ImgBurn, it and the other programs still fail on files with no eof (Kaspersky and Windows has such files). That is because these low-end programs do not use the Windows-builtin feature of a Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) which would solve in-use, file-locking and file-eof issues neatly. One way to accomplish backing up all C: files is to first copy the C: partition to a new partition (eg. using a hard disk manager program) and then to backup the new not-in-use partition files using a program such as ImgBurn.-- Install \"Cyberlink Media Suite\" from the included disk by clicking on the picture with the burning CD (hover over it to see \"Power2Go 7\"). At this time (9/24/11) there is no firmware update, so the bottom icon does not currently lead to an available download.-- If it bothers you, turn off the always-on-top InstantBurn software:---- on Windows 7 accomplish this by:------ goto Control Panel->System->Administrative Tools->System Configuration------ or navigate to [...]-------- click Startup tab-------- uncheck InstantBurn-------- click Apply, then OK-- To exit InstantBurn, either reboot (after disabling it from auto-start as described above) or Rclick on InstantBurn in the System Tray and click Exit.-- The included software has only minimal features and has many problems that may make it unusable for your purposes. You have to pay to upgrade any of the 4 component programs to get all features.===================More hardware details follow:(Technical specs provided by Asus on the product box and on other web sites)Asus BW-12D1S-U/BLK/G/AS External 12x Blu-Ray Burner [2x - 12x depending on BlurayDisc (BD) type]The Asus BW-12D1S-U/BLK/G/AS External 12x Blu-Ray Burner offers extreme 12x Blu-ray writing speed with USB 3.0.

I am now using DVDFab Media Player ($40 to buy, $10/year after that -- suggest you try trial version before buying -- note you will have to allow your firewall to connect to the server in China to use this software -- I got a helpful dialog popup from my Kaspersky antivirus asking if I trusted the Chinese server (which I do just for this one product, but you may not)) which works very well though I need to do Settings->Play->Playmode \"Quick and Simple\". AnyDVD does not work for me at all to play the Blu-Ray Game of Thrones. I have been using free FBackup4 (after rejecting half a dozen other popular programs such as Areca which is my second choice), an excellent and free solution to do mirror incremental backups on schedule. I burn data to DVD or Blu-Ray using the excellent free ImgBurn (and write at 12x speed to this ASUS BD writer). My needs are simple and Cyberlink did not satisfy any of them without enduring endless grief. I am purchasing another of this same ASUS BD writer for another PC, but will not waste time installing any Cyberlink software. Instead I will use software that works well and is easy to use and is almost all free.6/5/13 update: I have looked at the one star reviews and sympathize with your problems with USB 3.0 Windows drivers (which are definitely not the fault of this product). I suffered also from random USB 3.0 connection problems and read-write errors and bootup hangs for a very long time (since I was unfortunately on the leading edge of using USB 3.0 with my 2010 ASUS laptop). Finally I got smart and updated my USB 3.0 Host Controller Windows drivers and *all* the random problems with USB 3.0 disappeared! BTW, even though it is not free I highly recommend \"Driver Reviver\" as an easy way to quickly update all your Windows drivers, including the crucial USB 3.0 drivers (in particular the Host Controller drivers). You don't really need to use it more than once to solve all your USB 3.0 issues (so you don't need to renew it each year). Of course you can spend hours trying to find those same crucial driver updates on the web (I did that too, prior to Driver Reviver).Anyway, for anyone who wants to blame this *hardware* for your USB 3.0 software *driver* bugs, please see my post (Subject: \"Partial workarounds in a nutshell ...\" -- I should have said \"Full workarounds ...\") for the product \"J-Tech Digital SuperSpeed USB 3.0 4-Port Hub Backward Compatible with USB 2.0 with USB 3.0 Cable\". If you look at reviews for popular USB 3.0 hubs, you will also see a lot of false blame laid on the hardware when in fact the software drivers are almost always at fault when the hardware appears to only work sporadically.I totally agree that the bundled software with this ASUS BD writer is horrible in many respects and you should avoid using it if possible (see above for 6/4/13 update which mentions some reliable alternatives, in particular ImgBurn for writing BD-R discs). I also agree that ASUS has effectively zero customer support -- do not waste your time as I did trying to get any intelligent response out of them (prior to my proof that the Windows USB 3.0 drivers were the source of my problems). This ASUS BD writer has excellent performance and the problems you may have are almost certainly either due to your bad USB 3.0 drivers which need updating or to the miserable Cyberlink software included with this hardware.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "One of the best, if not the best pre-N router on the market today", "body": "I have been using many wireless routers (Linksys, D-Link, SMC, Netgear, Siemens...) over the years, since the early days of 802.11b, but this is my first experience with an Apple router (second, really: I've just replaced my first generation Airport Extreme router with this one which has a Gigabit switch instead of the original 100BT, so this is an update of the review I posted for the original model)There is no need to comment on the manufacturing quality, design and packaging: in typical Apple fashion, they're miles ahead of the competition. For instance, unlike all the other routers I ever used that came with a 110v only power supply, the Airport Extreme Base Station (AEBS for short) comes with a universal worldwide power supply equipped with a standard power cord.Performancewise, it is exceptional. I have been putting it through its paces over the past few days and it's barely breaking a sweat in situations where my previous routers (Linksys WRT54G and Netgear WGN824) would progressively get slower, or just plain crash and require a reboot. Coverage is excellent, better than my WGN824's which was already quite impressive.Apple has traditionally be doing things differently, and it shows here again: unlike most routers, which are managed by accessing a built-in web server, this router can only be configured using the \"Airport Utility\" configuration program. The bundled CD contains a Mac OS X and a Windows version of the utility (I can already hear groans from the Linux geeks). The utility is extremely simple to use, although I haven't tried to use the more advanced features such as setting up another router like the Airport Express as a range extender.One problem you might run into is the lack of support for \"legacy\" devices: although the AEBS offers a compatibility mode with WEP devices called \"WEP (Transitional)\" which lets WEP and WPA coexist, this mode imposes restrictions on the keys that may not work for you (for instance you won't be able to reuse an existing 40-bit WEP key). The problem is that WEP-40 and WEP-128 are not compatible with the 802.11n standard, so you have to choose between speed or full backwards compatibility. Also, you should know that WEP-40 and WEP-128 are not very secure: there are utilities out there that can crack these keys easily.Note that 802.11n gives a significant speed boost to the AppleTV and laptops equipped with compatible cards (such as Apple's Core 2 Duo laptops with the 802.11n enabler installed -- you can find the enabler on the AEBS CD). Unless you own one of these machines, there is no harm in switching to a non-802.11n radio mode. How? Just hold the command key (or control on Windows) while clicking on the \"Radio Mode\" popup in the Wireless tab of the AEBS configuration utility. Extra, non-n modes appear in the list, and once one is selected the WEP-40 and WEP-128 modes become available under Security. If you select WEP-40 or WEP-128 security, you can enter a hex key by prefixing it with a dollar sign.The AEBS also comes with a versatile USB port, which can be used to attach hard disks and/or a printer (USB hubs are supported). Unlike other base stations or NAS boxes, the AEBS does not require that you reformat the disk; all you have to do is plug it in and voil&agrave;! Instant NAS, all your files show up on the network. Some very basic access control features are provided. I plugged in the external USB drive I use to backup my MacBook, and now I can do automated backups without having to worry about remembering to plug in the drive: it just works wirelessly. The AEBS also lets you share a USB printer.Now that Apple has released the Time Capsule devices, they've also released a version of firmware (7.3.1) that supports Time Machine in similar fashion. Unfortunately some people complain that this feature does not work reliably for them. I've experienced a more annoying problem: the Nortel Contivity VPN software I use to connect to my office network no longer works reliably. I found out on Apple's forums that this is a fairly common complaint and a known problem, so I assume it will be fixed in the next release; reverting firmware to version 7.2.1 fixed the problem (and disabled Time Machine support).In conclusion, this router is a fantastic performer. Although it's one of the most expensive 802.11n routers out there, its feature set, build quality, performance and top-notch customer support more than make up for the price difference. Despite a couple of quirks, I recommend it highly -- although if you need Time Machine support you're better off buyingTime Capsuleat least until Apple addresses the problems in firmware 7.3.1.EDIT - Firmware 7.3.2 was released on 6/30/2008, and I have had no problems using the Nortel Contivity VPN since installing it.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "I love it", "body": "I've been using this keyboard for about 2 years now, and I love it.  It's slim and space-saving, and holds a charge fairly well.If you are a very, very heavy user like me you will need to put it out in the sun occasionally.  Obviously, putting it on a desk by a window will obviate this problem.  I've been able to drain the keyboard to non-usability by using it for about 12 hours a day for 3 days in a room with no window, but it held out for a surprisingly long time on just the room lighting and the keyboard illumination.  Once drained, it needs to be in the sun for about a day.If you put the keyboard on a desk with plenty of direct sunlight you would not be able to use it enough to drain it.  I'm surprised no one had thought of a solar-powered keyboard sooner, to be honest.The keyboard will warn you when it is not getting enough light, and when it is very low.  You also have a button you can press to audit your light intake and battery level at any time.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and would buy again!", "rating": "pos"}
{"title": "Nice sound, packaging overdone", "body": "I responded to an e-mail request to review these. Most of my reviews are books, and I have posted a huge number of reviews over the years. I don't use earbuds, for several reasons.Some people believe that putting anything in your ear is risky. But I wear hearing protection in any situation that requires me to raise my voice to carry on a normal conversation. Mowing the lawn, for example, is an earplug situation. One reason I don't wear earbuds is I don't have an iPod. I just don't care to listen to music.There's nothing wrong with earbuds, as long as you don't turn the volume up. Any speaker that close to your ear needs to be treated as a potential hazard. For this reason, I would not wear earbuds with a device on which the volume might accidentally adjust upwards.I evaluated performance by listening to the radio briefly through a jack that's on the cassette player I use to listen to audiobooks. I ran through a few stations, and listened to various compositions being played. I also listened to an audio tape, comparing with earbud and built-in speaker. The sound quality seems good to me. I did not turn the volume up beyond normal speaking level, because I'm not aware of any way to replace my ears if I damage them. So I didn't drive these to test the bass.The plug on these fits the jack on one of the DVD players on my workstation. I don't have anything to \"play\" so merely tested the jack. It doesn't fit any phones, as those jacks are smaller. Earbuds on a phone is stupid, of course, so no foul there.It doesn't fit my iTravl electronic translator, either. That device has an MP3 player that comes with audio books (and you can load more). I don't suppose an adapter plug would make much sense, as you get signal losses there.These earbuds came with several sets of plugs, so the user could try various ones and go with what's most comfortable. I tried several and they all seemed fine to me.On quality, these get high marks for their class (earphones, not headphones).Another aspect of these bothers me. The packaging is excessive. Users don't listen to the packaging, so elaborate packaging doesn't enhance the user experience. It simply creates waste. This practice of being conspicuously wasteful doesn't fit today's world.This product would provide a better value with reduced packaging and reduced price.", "rating": "pos"}

I took a wide variety of shots (people, buildings, scenery) and I must say the results are very good. I used program mode with ISO set to 200 and colors to vivid.

This is first for me, I kind of expected this.- Wifi only works on 2.4GHz band.  It does not work with 5Ghz band.  This is very disappointing, since I have a lot of noise on the 2.4GHz band in my area, making Wifi unreliable.- micro USB B connector seems to be non-standard.

{"title": "Nice HD Camcorder, but...", "body": "I bought this a few years back and have used it for both video and pictures.  I use the HDMI cable when playing back on my Plasma and the picture is amazing!  This little camcorder is great for both videos and camera snap shots.My decision to buy this version over the HFS10 (which has a hard drive for internal memory) was I figured without an internal hard drive there would be less that could go wrong with the camcorder.The manual states that it can use the faster speed (for video) with class 4 (I think) or higher SDHC cards, but that's only true IF the firmware has been upgraded.  For me, the camcorder had the older 1.0.2.0 or whatever it was firmware so it treats class 10 as a lower class because it does not recognize it is a faster class card.  No problem, just update the firmware right?  Right?  Um, right?  Well to do that, you need to ship it to a Canon repair center (mines will be sent to Newport News, VA).  Canon did not make the firmware upgrade available for \"at home\" upgrades so you cannot connect to camcorder to the PC and update it, you cannot get the firmware upgrade on a SD card and install it - only ship it to Canon.  Canon will pay to ship it back to you, but you need to ship it to them and pay the initial cost to ship and insure it.Aside from the firmware issue, I have not had any problems with using this camcorder.  It is great and offers a mix of auto and manual settings so if you have more experience you can adjust some of the settings but if you are a \"point and shoot\" person you can just let the auto settings do the work for you.Button placement is pretty good and you will most likely be comfortable using the various buttons.  I do sometimes screw up and push the \"photo\" button instead of the start/stop button for video recording and then find out that I didn't record what I meant to record but instead just took a snapshot.  My wife uses it sometimes but forgets that the rotating of the camcorder may work with snapshots but not video - i.e. the video playback will be \"sideways\" because of how she held the camcorder.  Since the camcorder doesn't have a viewfinder, she seems to want to use the LCD screen like a smartphone and hold the camcorder sideways.I have the extended battery with mine and between that battery and the standard battery I usually have enough power for the various family stuff I record.Again video and pictures are very crisp and clear - every so often if someone plays with the video camera settings without knowing what they are doing, you may get blurry pictures or recordings but not the camcorders fault.  I'm happy with it and although I wish the firmware was easier to update, I'm just removing one star for that.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Clear, narrow, not the perfect fit... But did I mention clear?", "body": "I'm a screen queen. I admit it. I've shopped and shopped for PDA and phone protectors into the wee hours of the morning trying to pre-determine which will have the best clarity, least light-stopping qualities.I didn't even realize I was missing clarity and brightness of my Galaxy SIII until I swapped out a somewhat worn old screen protector that came with my (used) phone a few months ago. WOW. Eye-popping difference. Very impressive clarity and I had to keep checking that my 'auto brightness' was activated and I wasn't on full bright, it's that clear - not exaggerating.This new 'HD' design seems to incorporate better clarity and a less bubble-prone installation, either that or I'm getting much better at doing the protector installation process. I've always used a freshly 'shower primed' bathroom method, but this time it was made easier with very clearly identified front and back coating tabs, clear instructions and great tips. Also included with the 'iSmooth HD' are two Dust Removal Stickers, which are invaluable for what you invariably notice that one half-millimeter fragment of lint. Just carefully use one of the sticker tabs you used to pull off the protector-protective film, lift the 'iSmooth' up and peel back slightly, slide that Sticker under there and grab that lint. The protector goes right back, no bubbles or issues. I have an almost perfect installation.Now, lining it up is a real challenge, because they made this VERY narrow. Even narrower than my old protector film, with what appears to be LESS than 1mm margin on each side of your screen. I understand this to a point; Samsung did make the S3 front glass curved. But I got it on there dead on, so I can't complain too much. It's not terribly sticky so it's easy to shift as long as you're careful to do the 'peel a bit, lay the exposed part down, and unpeel slowly' method.The only other issue is that the top lifts a bit, the area by the earpiece and camera. It doesn't lay flat, and can't, again due to Samsung's odd curved glass. Can't have it all, I guess.

{"title": "Apple iPod nano 16 GB Orange (4th Generation)", "body": "Been buying iPods since the original 3rd Gen harddrive versions.Bought the orange version 16Gb 4G nano since I lost the 16Gb red 3G version!!It's better than the 3G version since it's similar in size to the older 2G version.I won't rehash the details of what it has since you can read it at Apple's website and it's listed in many reviews already.I bought this one and another one on eBay so it's a refurb, but you know what, it does NOT matter.I checked the warranty and had 11 of the 12 months remaining, as even Apple guarantees their refurb units with a full year's warranty!It's very similar to other prior units but screen is brighter and it has the search function and accelerometer, which I don't use! Video viewing is NOT good for this model as the screen is too small and your eyes will hurt. I use my iTouch for watching movies, anyway!The sound quality is OK but other mp3 player's music quality is MUCH better (i.e. Sony Walkman mp3 players) at lower prices!But... Apple's iPods excel in decent music playback with a friendly user interface and a good media software (i.e. iTunes) though at a slightly higher cost then their competitor's mp3 products (i.e Sony Walkman mp3 players) which does not have user to use menus and/or NO media software like iTunes. The competitor's media software stinks or just refers people to use Windows Media Player (at least it's better than just drag n drop but how can do that if you can't rip music from CD's? Oh, right, use WMP)!Too bad the FM radio is NOT included (though it is included now in the newer 5G nano version).It's not worth upgrading to the newer version since nothing really changed as the sound quality is almost the same with similar features from the older models. Who cares about the video recorder when all I want is a good media player??The iPod nano is still a good media player though the competition is catching up to it! The MAIN reason Sony mp3 players will NOT catch up to the iPod is that Sony does NOT include any media softwaer (see above comment) and that it's user interface isn't \"that friendly\" even though the sound quality is much better and it costs less!Apple's tech support is abysmal and virtually NON-existent as you must PAY to get support.

{"title": "excellent", "body": "***Update***Just wanted to mention that I've used this product for a while now, and wanted to add some additional information. I never bother to turn the mouse off unless I was packing it up for travel. A single cheap battery lasted me 9 months. I've used it for everything from web browsing to design work to playing Skyrim. More precise games, like FPS were not really doable, but for less demanding games such as Civ 5 or Skyrim, it worked great. It is also a very durable product. I've dropped it a few dozen times, and it still works great. The right-mouse button has some issues with staying clicked when I hold it down (only really noticeable in gaming), but as much as I've abused this thing, that was bound to happen.The ball does get dirty fairly quickly, so you have to pop it out and and clean out the gunk about once a month. Very little maintenance. If the ball starts feeling like it isn't rolling as smooth, it's time to clean it.The battery slot has a very convenient place to put the universal dongle when traveling, that has proven itself very useful. Haven't lost the dongle :). Speaking of the dongle, the range has been very good for me. 15 feet with an almost clear line of site, and no issues with connectivity and response time.Very comfortable, although you will find your thumb fatigued from time to time. It helps to keep a more standard mouse in the rotation for times like that.The logitech m570 has found a permanent place in life. For $35, it was a great purchase.***Original***Let me tell you something, I HATE the track pads that come on laptops. However, mice can be so inconvenient for laptops because you need a surface to use it on. The trackball is great for people who don't have a lot of desk space or find themselves sitting somewhere without a desk at all. Not moving my arm around is great, no more sore wrist for me. The trackball comes presynced with the universal USB dongle and works out of the box with Ubuntu. Pairing multiple devices with the dongle will require windows or Mac for now. Logitech has stated that they will soon be supporting Linux. We'll see...Anyway, I don't think I could use this for gaming, but for just working it is perfect", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Intel drivers...buggy", "body": "This replaced an Intel Advanced N6235 card that is in my Samsung Series 7 laptop. I have Win 8 x64 and an Asus RT-N56U running Padavan custom firmware. I only use the 5ghz band.So far, used it for an hour or so.....just as good speeds and range as my previous card. Drivers seem just fine. I haven't had any ping issues that others seem to have reported about this card....as of yet.Once my Asus RT-AC56U arrives....I will see how AC wifi is and if it results in any faster transfer speeds to and from my file server. Currently, on N300...I get about 20 -24 MB's transferring my 1gb test video file over the network.  Will update once I get the AC router.UPDATE 1-28-14Since I got the card, (and its been awhile now) Intel wifi drivers definitely were an issue for a while. Many people reporting of stability issues from a new batch of drivers that Intel decided to release.(smallnetbuilder.com is where i frequent). I had various issues such has frequent disconnect or lag to connect and complete random failure of the wifi driver at times. I ended up doing a clean OS install since I upgraded to Win 8.1 anyway. Intel seems to have worked out most of their issues with the current drivers, but it was a very bumpy road...this AC wifi support it has been. And the Intel PRO Set software is still ugly.....they really need to revamp it...As for the performance...it has varied from Intel driver version to the Asus router firmware updates that have been released since purchase...(Asus is always updating stuff....very good to see).Currently, things haven't been better.....around 40-50MB'S downlink speed, and about 15-30MB's uplink speed I am getting transferring files to and from wired computer to wifi laptop in the same room as the router. And this is only a 2 stream AC wifi card with a  2 stream router....really wish my laptop had 3 antennas so i could use a 3 stream card....(why do most laptops still only come with 2 antenna setups nowadays) (least I don't have a Lenovo, you can't upgrade or change the wifi card...u get a nice \"Not authorized hardware\" message and can't boot.)AC is still in its infancy(despite how fast retail market is pushing it). It has certainly been bumpy as an early adopter, but patience as drivers and firmware have gotten updated to fix bugs....well worth it now.I still get occasional wifi hiccups where latency will suddenly spike(continuous ping to wired device shows 3-5ms among all the 1ms ones every 10-20 pings) Plus, when I stream HDTV in Media Center from my HDHomeRun Prime, the video will occasionally just pixelate and drop out for a second....and I have noticed that the bug of the wifi just disconnecting without warning over time is still around(i leave my laptop on alot) making it too unreliable to record with.  When  I was using my non AC hardware (RT-N56U and the Intel N6235) I never had any issues like this....it was rock solid.  But I guess you have to sacrifice something to stay bleeding edge.I don't know of any other mainstream AC wifi cards..it has been a while since I have looked....but I have read and seen from CES that the next gen of AC cards and router tech coming this year are going to be much improved. THings should only get better from this point.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Best Card Reader I Ever Had!", "body": "Are you looking for a new memory card reader?  Not sure which one to get?  I highly recommend the Kingston 19 in 1 (FCR-HS219/1) card reader.  I recently had a Transcend card reader that died, though I loved that card reader, it died on me for some reason.  I wanted to get that card reader again, but they didn't make it anymore, But I am glad this happened because I now have the Kingston card reader that was much better than the Transcend one.  One thing that I like is the is the USB cable built into the card reader, mainly for portable usage, like use on a laptop.  But it also comes with a USB extension cable.I find this card reader to be actually much more faster than my older USB 2.0, even though it's still USB 2.0, I have noticed a big difference in speed when taking data off from it, much less time.  I personally got this card reader because a slot for MicroSD and MMC Micro cards.  Not many have separate slots just for these memory cards and those cards are very small and it hard to get them in.It supports many cards, like SD, SDHC, Compact Flash, MicroSD, Memory Stick Duo/Pro, M2, MMC Micro.  Of course, those are just the most popular ones.  Remember it is a 19 in one card reader, so it will read up to 19 different memory card types. It also features a little slider on top, you just push the Kingston logo button down and then you either move it forward or backwards and what this does is protect the card input slots.  Handy if you are traveling, but other than that I keep the slots in view all the time, because I use it so much.

Its much easier to research and compare, then come back to Amazon when you know what you want and type in the model number. This way you know what the most current models are, specs, etc.- Delivery was from a freight carrier, not UPS or Fedex, we did pre scheduled delivery at checkout, and they sent me a couple confirmation emails, and delivered the TV on the expected day a week later.- Overall pleased with the experience from Amazon, being my first big screen TV from them.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "You will never want to put this camera down!", "body": "I shot 35mm film ages ago, but stopped when the cost of purchasing film and processing fees became prohibitive.  I have been a photographer in one form or another for nearly 20 years.  I decided that I definitely wanted to go digital, but was not happy with any of the cropped sensor bodies available at the time (early 2000's).  When the 1Ds and 5D models first became available, I drooled, but couldn't justify the amount of money.  So I waited.  Along came the 5D Mark II (or as we say in the software industry, version 2.0)  The price was lower than the original 5D and the quality and speed were even better then the now-three year old model.  I saved my pennies and nickels for a while and finally purchased one!From the moment I picked up the demonstrator model in the store, I knew this was the camera for me.  Well balanced, large view-finder, and *gasp* video!  I'm not much of a videographer, but seriously, taking HD clips with a prime lens on a full-frame sensor is just insane!Pros:- Low-light performance has to be seen to be believed.  I'm sure you have heard the hype, but it's not hype.  You really can take reasonable pictures in much darker rooms than you ever thought possible.- Well balanced in your hands- Simple menu system that does not require an engineering degree to use.- Image quality (IQ) that simply blows away everything else in its class.- Price is actually reasonable for what you get; hundreds less than the competition.- Video!Cons:- The IQ is _too_ good.  You can actually tell the difference between pictures taken with \"L\" glass and those that were not.- Frame rate isn't great for sports.  If this is your intended use, look at the 7D or 1D.- Video limited in odd ways.  Then again, this is a DSLR, not a camcorder.In spite of what I just said about taking pictures with \"L\" glass, this camera is perfectly serviceable with regular lenses.  Just realize that they are \"consumer\" grade and will have issues when shot wide open or when at the minimum or maximum of the zoom range.  That said, the \"nifty fifty\" (50mm f/1.8) that sells for around $100 takes astonishingly good pictures.If you're just starting out, the lenses that I would recommend buying with this body are:17-40mm f/4 L - Eye-popping landscapes.  The 16-35mm f/2.8 L is a stop faster, but neither lens will see much indoor use as you would have to be mere inches away from your subject to fill the frame.  The extra stop also doubles the price with little benefit in the scenarios that it is likely to be used.  At 2.8 the faster lens is quite soft, and the image quality in general is not quite as good.  Save your money and get the 17-40.  You won't be sorry!24-70mm f/2.8 L - Fantastic walk-around lens.  The 24-105mm f/4 that comes in the 5DMkII kit has more reach and is image stabilized, but I still prefer the speed of the 24-70.  You can do more with it in lower light sitations.70-200mm f/2.8 L - The IS version of this lens is silly expensive, but the standard version shares the same glass with its brother.  For portraits and weddings, you cannot have a finer lens.  The f/4 cousins are smaller and lighter.  If you plan to shoot outdoors most of the time where there is sufficient light, then you should be fine with it.  Indoors you will find yourself using a flash more often, even with the IS version of the f/4.  The bokeh from the f/2.8 is noticeably better too.50mm f/1.8 or f/1.4 - The \"L\" version of this lens is f/1.2 and about $1k more.  It's soft at f/1.2 and shoots its best at f/1.4 and higher.  The \"L\" glass _is_ better than its cheaper cousins, but is it really worth it?  This is one of the rare cases where there is little need to buy the \"L\" version.  Buy the f/1.4 for $350 or the f/1.8 for $100 and enjoy it.", "rating": "pos"}

I needed a new way to send audio to my car's sound system.I connected this device to the AUX jacks on my car using a 6 ft 3.5mm female to male RCA Y-Cable. The length of this cable allows me to leave it hanging outside my console for easy access to turn the device on and off.After the initial sync to my phone, it connects right away when the device is turned on. There is also not a huge (if any) sound quality difference between the headphone jack and the Bluetooth Adapter.Pros:- Easy to sync (so far have synced to Android phone and iPad)- Good battery life- Great sound quality- Portable (have used it to stream music to different sound systems)Cons:- This is my main annoyance with the device, but it needs a better way to turn it on / off. The time I have to hold the power button down on the device seems to vary from a couple seconds to like 10 seconds. You must watch for the LED to flash to let you know to stop pushing the button. If you keep pushing the button, then the device will enter the sync mode. It doesn't sound like a big issue, but I'm doing it several times a day, everyday.- I wish there was a better way to tell how much battery power you have left. The device starts to insert beeps into the audio when the power is getting low and if it happens in the middle of a drive, then it becomes really annoying.

I used it to &#34;recycle&#34; the hard drive from a computer I was throwing away due to motherboard failure into a back-up drive.  I have done this several times before and seem to keep giving them away after awhile.Assembly:  The directions are very easy to follow, they are on the back of the box (I had to hunt for them!).  All you need is a jewelers Phillips screwdriver--2 screws to separate the top and the bottom (they sort of slide apart, left and right).  Then slide your hard drive onto the connector.  I found this sort of tricky as you can't really see the connector, but it seemed to connect with a firmish sort of feel--it's all plastic, so you don't want to force it!  Then two tiny Phillips screws in the sides of the drive case (included); slide the case together and put back the screws you originally removed.Operation:  It has a wall wart that is long, so it fits next to another plug on my powerbar (it's the last one, so I don't know if it would fit if it were in the middle).  It has a special cable from to connect to the USB port on your computer.  It is not like a traditional cable, it has an extra bump in it, this could be a USB 3.0 thing, I really don't know.  Both cables are about 3 feet long, which I consider a bit short (1/2 star).  It has a cool light that is flickering yellow/green right now (I am re-formatting the hard drive).  Finally, it has two little &#34;wings&#34; on the bottom that are about an inch long that flip out and provide stability in the upright position.Overall:  It looks cheap, feels cheap (1/2 star) and I don't have the feeling of sturdiness that I've experienced with other cases I've tried.  I will not be banging this around, as I just don't think it would tolerate the abuse. It works and will do what I want it to do, but nothing extra.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Extraordinary image quality, construction could be better", "body": "This lens is worth the $70 price tag, hands down.  No lens in this price range opens to f/1.8.  With that wide-open aperture comes a great deal of flexibility shooting indoors or in low light.  I've used this lens to photograph a good number of events indoors and outdoors, especially at night.  The images are sharp and clear at all apertures.Build quality and autofocus are this lens's only weaknesses.  It's inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting anything special, but the all-plastic construction does feel a bit frail.  The autofocus feels slow to me and hunts in low light.  Overall, however, this is a great piece of equipment.Keep in mind that this is an 80mm f/1.8 lens on a Rebel due to the focal length multiplier.

If you put one battery in it will charge faster than if you have batteries in both positions. And even one cell takes a very long time to charge fully.This Nikon charger brings the EN-EL15 to full charge very fast. As I need to keep both my batteries charged it made sense to get a second charger.It comes with a long AC cable and a close-fitting dual prong plug that allows it to become quite compact. I wish the prongs folded into the charger however. Once you install the close-fitting plug the two prongs extend out the back making the unit that much thicker and a bit more difficult to store easily.Overall the best EN-EL15 charger I've found and not rediculously expensive.", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Logitech Z-2300 2.1 speaker system", "body": "This is not a professional review, just my thoughts.I did a whole lot of research on speakers. To include 5.1s, but I really don't need that much. There were so many mixed reviews on so many brands. It came down to this set and Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 THX. I think I went with the Logitech because of the price and the wired controler. Plus, I've had good luck with logitech in the past.Unfortunately, no matter the brand, It all seemed pretty much a crap shoot on what you were going to get. There was a newer model than this one, but the reviews were not quite as good at the time I was doing my research. So, I figured on the odds. This model has received a ton of reviews, under 150 bad (3 stars and lower) and nearly 1200 good (1 to 2 stars). With those odds, I took the plunge and hoped I ended up with a good set.Now, I do not require the absolute best in sound, if I did, I'd be looking to spend way more than $109. But, I've heard more expensive systems sound worse than these. I cannot rock my house down, because there is more than me living here...and I want to keep my hearing thank you. But, this system has more than met my needs. While I wished the speakers had individual controls, my last (dell 5.1) didn't either, so I'm not missing anything.Sound is good and I actually like the little wired controler.

And all for a very good price. The padding is thin and the sleeve is pretty flexible, but you're not really expecting the protection of a sturdy case at this price point anyhow. If a skin-tight fit is of paramount importance to you, then you may or may not get that fit with a sleeve bought online.

{"title": "Good for Larger Filters", "body": "Received this as a gift from my son. I use it to hold six filters, three each for 58mm and 67mm filters of different types. For these size filters the pockets hold them nicely with no danger of sliding out or clinking against adjacent filters. I also placed several 52mm filters in the pockets to test for fit and the fit was good for them also; smaller filters might be an issue, though, due to the size of the individual pockets.There is a decent amount of padding provided, and this should hold up to everyday use and the occasional short drop onto concrete (if the pouch is closed). The lining is fairly soft and shouldn't scratch any of the filters. The velcro closure is pretty strong and should protect against accidental openings. The outer jacket is typical camera bag material and will pick up some dirt but should be easy to clean. This is not an airtight case, and use in dirty, wet, or dusty environments could get the filters dirty.Note that this is a soft case, and won't provide much protection if stepped on.

My Xperia fits snugly length wise, but it has a little room to spare in height.  It does not move around, but it comes out easy enough too.  I would expect that iPads being a bit narrower would move around inside the case.  However, for a typical 10\" tablet, the Targus A7 should be a good option.  The Xperia is almost 10.5\" wide.

Read through the short instructions, everything appears to be as described in the product notes.  Holy connectors Batman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This thing has connectors for just about every product under the sun.  I think the connectors alone were worth the price I paid for this thing, that's awesome!I plugged the battery in and it was charged after about an hour, so it must have had a pretty good charge out of the box.  Once charged I connected my Razr Maxx and it took the battery level on the phone from 40% to 100% within about 60-90 minutes.  So it seems to work as advertised and it's pretty simple to use.  Either one of the USB ports is the correct voltage for most smart phones, you'll have ot read the directions for connecting a Galaxy 2 or iPad.  It will charge them, they just have one port optimized for each device.As I mentioned it isn't exactly small.  It's about the same footprint of my Moto Razr Maxx, but probably 2.5x as thick, so it's got some girth to it.  However, what would you expect for a 10,000 mAh battery??

I can't comment on the wireless speed as it happened to be close to our router so it has ethernet connected. After many movies I can only think of twice that it paused to catch up on download streaming. Honestly the only 2 negatives I can say is that out of the box I needed to update three times rather than one update to bundle all of them it made me install one after another each taking about 10 minutes. That said i'm just glad Sony is providing the updates to fix items or add features. The other is the on screen keyboard for youtube is poorly designed.

{"title": "The DIY security system!", "body": "It was easy to set up (you do need to reed the included instryctions, but they are easy)!Set up took me about an hour. I did spent 15 min reading the included manual.Then it took me another 30 min for the installation of the main unit and all the sensors.I used my drill and just drilled all the motion sensors to the upper corners of the wallswhere I needed them (screws are included). Then I attached all the door sensors the all the doorsusing the included 2-sided stickers, and I added pieces of tape just in case the sticker glue doesn'tlast very long.Then I spend another 15 min for playing with the settings of the main unit - I made the settings to my liking,including adding phone numbers for both making a phone call and sending a text in case the alarm is triggered.I am using an AT&T; SIM card. I tested it and it works great. Every time the alarm is triggered the main unit will call the number (my cell phone) and also send me a text.For thos of you wondering what kind of SIM card it is using - regular, micro or nano - it uses the regular SIM.That info I couldn't find anywhere online, and only found after I received the unit and opened it.Also - all sensors included in this package are pre-registered to the unit. You don't have to do anything but turn them on and they are already working with the main unit. The motion sensors have an ON/OFF button. The door sensors don't have an ON/OFF button. You don't have to install all included sensors, only install as many as you need. If you have some left over (not needed) just don't put the batteries in them and/or leave them in OFF position. By the way - each sensor comes with its own battery included. If you need extra sensors just buy them separately. Extra sensors do need to be added and registered through the main unit - I added 3 more Motion sensors which I bought separately. Each one came with an instruction how to add it (it's very easy).The unit and sensors are pre-programmed for you so that all door sensors are Zone 1 and all Motion sensors are Zone 2. The unit and remote give you the option to fully ARM it - which arms all Zones, or you can do the so called second option for arming called &#34;Home arm&#34; which will only arm Zone 1 - only the door sensors - you can do that when at home or when you go to sleep. You can reprogram all sensors and zones if you want to, but I don't see a point, they are already programmed in the best way possible, in my opinion.One recommendation - set up the arming time to more time - about 30-40 seconds should be OK for most people; and set up the disarming time to less time - about 0-10 seconds. Most people will use the included remote control which works like a car remote - you will just click on arm/disarm. The remote will work from outside the house - unless you have a huge house I guess and the alarm unit is far away from the door/garage. If your alarm unit is relatively close the your main door/gate or garage door - it should work with no problem with your remote. So if it works fine - just set up the &#34;DISARM TIME&#34; to less time - zero to ten seconds - so in case of an intruder - he/she won't have enough time to somehow disarm it - which may be possible if they remove the power cord and the battery. And YES - this alarm unit comes with an included and installed back up power battery which should last at least 1 day - I couldn't find info on that, but it comes with it, which makes the unit power protected.You can also connect the unit to a regular phone line, if you have one - a house phone that has regular phone connections. The unit comes with phone IN and phone OUT inputs. You can also connect it to hardwired sensors - I am not sure how that works but the connections/attachment bolts are on the back of this unit. Also in the Manual it offers options for Security companies to add the unit to their system, so it is possible to have this unit with a security company - so long as they agree to use it - I guess in that case you'll just add their phone number, and when the unit triggers an alarm - it will call them, and then they will call you and they can send a security person to your house. You can program program the unit to call up to 5 phone numbers and text up to 3. So it is possible to program it to call a Security company and yourself at the same time as well. Keep in mind that id you do want to use it with the security company there will be monthly fees with them for the service. Otherwise there are no monthly fees to just use this unit with your own phone number, if you don't count the SIM card charges (get a pre paid SIM card).I added a pre-paid AT&T; SIM card which at the moment costs 10 cents a phone call and I believe 20 cents a text message. You can add $10 or $20 to it, and then recharge the SIM card when needed. It's not a monthly fee SIM, so you won't have a monthly expense for this alarm unit. With only $10 in the SIM and if the alarm is NOT triggered you may last 6 months and more with that SIM card without recharging it. Unless you add the feature to send you a text message each time the alarm is armed and disarmed - this is an optional setting. You can also turn on/off a feature to remotely turn on and off the alarm via a text message. So if these features are on and used often, then you will need to recharge your SIM card more often, as it will cost you for each text. So keep these things in mind.And last - I will mention about the sirens. This package comes with 2 sirens. One is smaller and has to be next to the alarm unit because it plugs in it and doesn't need separate power cord and the other is bigger - that is a remote alarm, of course it is pre-programmed to work with the main unit - if you bought this package - and it uses a power cord with adapter. So you just plug it in somewhere else. Preferably the main unit and small siren should be installed in one side of the house and the bigger remote siren should be installed in the other side of the house. Some people install the remote siren in the garage, in an outside building - like a second house, or a shed or in the backyard or front yard if you have a power outlet there. Just make it hard for an intruder  to find both sirens fast - they should be far apart in my opinion. And YES - both are loud and can be clearly heard by the neighbors even if both are installed inside your house.So this is my review of the Fortress Security GSM-B Wireless package. I haven't needed to call their customer service yet, as everything I needed to do was clearly explained the the manual and I had no problem installing all the parts. This is in my opinion the best and easiest DIY (do it yourself) alarm system which offers many features and optional componetns (you can add glass breaking and smoke alarm sensors to it) and a system that is loud enough and secure enough (uses the most secure cellular networking to send you a text or phone call) and is protected with a back up battery in case of power outage.So I recommend it to anyone!Buy this system. I did so a month ago (bought it from Amazon) and I can say this has been one of the best investments I have made in the recent past!", "rating": "pos"}

{"title": "Amazing sound, dazzling look.", "body": "This docking system was smaller than I expected, but the size isn't indicative of the sound potential.  The aluminum outer body gives the docking system clean and precise lines. The buttoms are a good size and seem to be high quality and will hold up to long term use.  The display has three different brightness settings that make it versatile in rooms with variable lighting.  It has battery backup requiring two AA batteries.  Also in the box was an auxiliary cable that will allow any sound device with a headphone jack to play through the system. The aux cable plugs into the back of the system, next to the antenna wire, hiding it when not in use. With newer TVs, you could run the aux cable from the TV's headphone jack to the aux port, giving the TV better sound. Additionally, there is no bulky AC adapter, just a regular sized plug.Setup was easy.  You plug it in and the time and date appear automatically.  Love that.  My iPod fits on the cradle while in my case with no problem.  I don't have an iPad, so I can't speak to how well or securely it would fit. There is a source button near the cradle, so it's easy to choose your iPod and start playing it immediately.The sound is simply amazing.  By using the remote, you can choose rock, flat, jazz, or classical equalizer sound settings.  You can choose to turn on a setting called Dynamic Bass, but that turns off the equalizer setting. The volume goes up plenty loud and fills a large room with high quality music. Even at the highest volume, the speakers seem to handle both the highs and lows with no problem.  The speakers do not seem to bottom out, even in the heavy bass songs. Radio is very good.  We can pick up stations fifty miles away.  You can have up to twenty preset stations that are easy to maneuver to.The remote is small and sturdy (aluminum also) and is the preferred method to take advantage of the many features of this docking station.  You can set the dual alarm to go off at different times for each day of the week.  You can also set the alarm to play music from your iPod or radio quite easily with the remote.Overall, this docking system exceeds expectations. This would make the perfect clock radio/speaker system for a living room, bedroom, or even outdoor patio.  It would be perfect for a college student's dorm room because of the smaller size, the iPod charging option that frees up an outlet, and the multi day alarm system.", "rating": "pos"}

Don't expect movie theater sound quality out of the speakers.  You could get a sound bar as a alternative. The remote works fine, but the buttons feel cheap.  No big deal.  I do wish you could program special buttons. Example:  There is a button on the remote for Netflix and it takes you to netflix, but if you want to go directly in to pandora, there is no button and you can't program one of the buttons for pandora.  Again, not a big deal, but would be a nice to have feature.So if you are looking for a decent TV with a ton of internet options, this is a great buy.

THey have this cool looking nylon or canvas wrap around the wire that goes into a really durable  input jack that looks like its on steroids, but that is where the shine ends.  The buds themselves will not stay in your ear.  They come with these colorful ear buds that are made out of a thin rubber, almost as thin as rubber gloves that doctors use.  THey will not stay in your ear. I tried to many ways and times and wouldn't stay right.  Good thing I had some cushy foam ones from my last pair that were a cheap JVC brand so I took these off and they stayed in better.  It comes with two other sized of buds to switch out with but only one of each.  I'm like what is this? I looked at the other ones and they are the same and they are all different colors.  The smallest size is red, which there is only one of them, and the large size is black of which there is only one for one ear.  Why they only gave you one for one ear I don't know.  Now the sound, well the JVC seemed to be crisper treble and tigher mids and deeper bass that was really tight and compared to these which were about $10 more, these sound decent, but not as good as the JVC.  The treble will not cut through, and I listen to a broad range of music and tried many things.  The bass is not too deep, its ok and it will get you by but if you want better enjoyment out of your earbuds these don't sound too good.What is so frustrating?  Well this cord that I give them a 10 on for durability, has that canvass or nylon wrapped over the wire and it acts like an amplifier.  Everything it rubs against on you goes straight to the earbuds and you'll hear it.  It sounds like your underwater and you hear that strange noise above the water.  The cord becomes a nuisance and you won't be able to enjoy your music experience or what ever you need them for.  You do what you want to, but I'm taking my back to Target where I got them from.**Update**Finally took them back to Target and ordered the NuForce NE-700X! These stay in my ears and sound great, they are about $30 more but you get a cord that is just as durable and well constructed as the Specked O'Neal ones but somehow they don't send you an amplifed sound to your ears.

{"title": "Wolf in sheep's clothing!!", "body": "First off let me state that I DID NOT purchase this product from Amazon but rather I got one as a Christmas gift and have been using it for a 2yrs. I'm a semi-pro photographer and I own 3 other cameras ( 1 canon p&s; included) along with this camera. When I first got this camera I was trilled by the 14MP and the touch screen capabilities. It was my first Nikon as well since I AM A CANON FAN HEAD.During my first few photos I tested all the features and different effects etc. until I began noticing that when zoomed in the photos were fussy and unpleasant to look at. It was nasty when it came to providing sharp edges and mostly required the flash to assist in keeping images sharp - not razor sharp, but sharp. The flash was another headache it was ridiculous, causing red eyes everywhere. But depending on the scene it would light very nicely. The HD 720p video capabilities is nothing to shout about, as that too was a unsuccessful function on Nikon's part. I would take videos and when I upload them on the PC to edit them they would lag and sometimes be distorted. Zooming in was a waste of time as the images would be horrifying. The touch screen was slow to react which was a major turn off. Playback lags and having to slide through pictures sometimes you miss the photo you really want to get to. The battery I find, last pretty long FOR ME; as I don't use it(the camera) on a major scale. With that is said I'm looking to sell this Nikon and buy a Canon bridge camera. The ONE TIME I decided to give Nikon a chance I was fooled!In comparison to the Canon P&S; I mentioned earlier, this Nikon is only 4 more mega-pixels stronger than my canon and the HD Video and touch screen are the only functions my dear Canon p&s; doesn't have other than that my 3 yr old canon p&s; still beats out this Nikon!I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I have tested about 10 discs with various source files and multiple burners, as well as different players.Let me start with the packaging: I think the amazon frustration-free packaging is great and have encountered it before, but for these DVD's it appeared that the package was dirty and even inside the package had something that looked like a stain. Still, I think the amazon packaging is a plus.Burn Speed: These DVD's burned at the same speed as any others that I've recently encountered, I had no problems during the burn process.Disc Design: A nice blank top for labeling my discs was my only criteria, Amazon did well in this aspect.Reliability: As far as I'm concerned, Amazon forgot to include reliability when making the DVD's. The quality is just terrible, I have not had a single disc work as it should. The discs skip and the picture breaks up, but not until about a third of the way through the disc.

{"title": "Video Fair, Audio Horrible, Durability Questionable", "body": "I've had this camera for one month and I'm returning it.  I have a detailed video review with sample footage out on Youtube which unfortunately is way too long for Amazon's restrictions, but you should be able to find it if you search for: \"w469o3CkiCw\" or \"JVC Adixxion Action Camera Review GC-XA1\".Brief summary: The video isn't as good as I'd like.  Up close, it's crisp and clear but anything distant is fuzzy as is anything in motion. The audio is downright horrible if you are moving fast enough to generate any wind noise.  I covered the microphone with a piece of tape and it helped a lot, but it's still not great.  But the worst part is: the record button has begun to stick so I can't reliably record anything or do any menu setting.What I can say good about it is:1. The bottom and side 1/4-20 tripod mounts are a great feature!2. The size is fantastic - really allows mounting almost anywhere.3. The menus are easy to use.4. Nice to have LCD screen.5. Uses SD cards (not micro-SD cards)6. Uses a standard USB cable.7. There is a setting to invert the video if you mount it upside down.8. Time lapse mode creates .mp4 movies (super! gopro creates a series of still images)9. If you use the USB cable to connect to your computer, software to install Wifi is on the camera as is the full instruction manual!10. Battery life is acceptable - well over 1 hour, maybe 2'ish?11. Recharge time maybe 3-4 hours.12. Records video in .mp4 format.Some bad things and these are:1. Video quality very soft, not sharp at all.2. Audio horrible due to wind noise.3. The Wifi was not easy to setup or use, but I did get it working on my PC, but not on my iPad, but I don't care about Wifi at all.4. Durability very questionable as the record button has quit working.5. Clear Plastic lens caps hard to remove, easy to lose.6. Can't shut LCD screen off so time-lapse movies are limited without changing battery.The camera would definitely be 10 stars if the video and audio quality equaled GoPro and if it hadn't broken because the everything else about from an ease of use perspective is exceptional.I'm going to buy something else, trying to decide between GoPro HD Hero 2 and Contour+2.", "rating": "neg"}

This distinction is well earned.  I had bought 5 computers from HP in the last few years because of previous reliability, but that fact is only part of history.  Two of my laptops failed with the same problem after warrantee.  Naturally, HP was not interested.  Only afterwards did I find out the problem was known to HP for which they had a silent recall and that there was a successful class action against them. I joined the class action and was approved to receive 2 replacements.  But wait, there's more. By law HP had 4 months to provide a replacement, and they took every one of those days to do it.  Here is the kicker.  The model of the replacement was the Presario CQ56, which cost a fraction of the originals.  It is a cheap close-out model, one that is quite inferior to other models.The screen is quite adequate.  Here after things get worse.  The keyboard is very flat.  The keys don't distinguish themselves enough to reduce errors. The layout is strange and has no provisions for numbers or calculation.  There are only three USB ports.  After a printer, wireless mouse, and a video-cam, you are out to luck.  Perhaps it's possible to defeat the mouse pad, but it is not done by the traditional F6 key, which means it will pick up palm movements even when you use a mouse cursor.

Since my CD collection had approached the 400 mark, I decided to purchase the Sony CDP-CX455 unit, so that I could randomly listen to my entire collection, without constantly changing CD's. After reading some of the reviews on Amazon, I was reluctant to purchase this unit. Unable to find another unit that would accomodate 400 CD's, I decided to take a chance and went ahead with the purchase. Big mistake! After spending hours loading the CD's into the system and setting it to play on random(shuffle), I soon discovered that several of my CD's were skipping. I am meticulous with the handling of my CD's, so I know that the problem was not caused by my mishandling of them. I removed the CD's that were skipping, hoping that this was an isolated incident. The next day, I turned on the unit and again set it to play songs randomly. Once again, some of the CD's started skipping. When I removed them from the unit, I noticed that there were scratches on both CD's. I then called up Sony to explain to them that this particular CD changer has an engineering defect, and that it scratches CD's. Their response was that they have had no reports of such incidences. I asked to speak with a supervisor, who informed me that this CD changer has been taken off the market and is not being replaced with a similar unit. He said that stores still had them in stock, but once the stock was exhausted there would be no more available. I then asked him why they were not replacing this unit with another 400 CD changer model, and was told that they are getting out of the CD changer business, in favor of DVD/CD combo units. I offered the comment that the reason they are not replacing the CDP-CX455 with a similar unit, is because they know that the CDP-CX455 has an engineering defect, and they are not capable of building a 400 CD unit that is problem free. At any rate, I called the store where I purchased my changer from, and told them that I was returning it because it was scratching my CD's. I then started the long process of removing the CD's from the system and was astounded to find that almost 1 out of every 3 CD's had been scratched by this CD changer. I called back Sony, and their attitude was basically that they couldn't care less. Once you buy a Sony product, you are on your own. Their customer support is non existent.

{"title": "Not much good", "body": "Right off the bat my first one arrived extremely scratched up due to the poor packaging. My second one also had scratches, but was tolerable. Maybe I'm picky, but the whole point of this case is to have protection without covering up the Macbooks nice look.For protection, it's not even that great. Oh sure, it will stop a foreign object from ruining your Macbook, but the case itself scratches. It's problem is it has a nice snug fit (probably to cut down on bulk), which initially sounds good. But the snug fit means that if you move your Macbook while the case is on, it rubs on the metal leaving marks. It also has several clips to keep it securely attached, Again a good idea, but the clips too leave marks.My Macbook looks worse than ever thanks to this lousy case. I had to buy a new bottom cover for my Macbook (ok I didn't HAVE to, but it was all scratched up), but can't do anything about the marks left on the cover and sides other than pay Apple to fix it. Since this case doesn't protect against drops, there is simply no point in wasting money on it. If you want real protection, I suggest the Invisibleshield by Zagg, or a case with a rubber interior that doesn't cause damage.It baffles me why it has gotten such good reviews. Perhaps people haven't checked under the cover to see the damage it did to their Macbooks.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Setup is not intuitive, everything is tiny, nothing works", "body": "The device has a lot of white space on the front, but the icons and buttons are tiny, forcing you to get down on your knees (\"bow down, simple human\") in front of this thing to see which button is which. On top of that, \"option 2\" setup is not intuitive at all, even for someone with undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical engineering. It won't let you change the SSID name of the booster (it'll keep changing it back to its default), so I don't know why changing it is even an option. This is one more example of engineers making devices no one can use.The WPS option also didn't end up working, so I called \"support.\" Make sure you get the serial number (may need a magnifying glass) before you call. After 40 minutes with a very helpful tech support guy, who was doing his best to deal with a dfective device, trying the same things I'd tried before, the recommendation was to *downgrade* the firmware from 1.0.0.22 to 1.0.0.20. I was assured that that would solve all of my problems. It did not. Instead the device went from working poorly to not working at all (status light was now red).When I called back with the case number, I had to verify everything all over again (name, phone number, e-mail address). I was, however, grateful that I didn't have to get back on my knees with a magnifying glass to re-verify the serial number.Options tried: factory reset (hold a pin in the reset hole for 30 seconds) and hard reset (hold a pin in the reset hole for 60 seconds). Why you need to hold a pin for that long in a hole is beyond me. I understand if it was a button that could accidentally be pushed, but a hole that can only be accessed deliberately with a pin? All of this while on my knees! The last option suggested: shock reset or some other made-up term: unplug, hold down pin for 30 seconds, then replug while holding down the pin the whole time! That was the last straw. I shouldn't have to do all of this to get a little device to work. I'm returning this. Avoid this time sink.", "rating": "neg"}
{"title": "An average set of headphones at a way above average price", "body": "For the record:  I'm an average guy.  I'm no a super duper audiophile with a finely tuned ear to distinguish all the nuances of super sound quality that many sets of headphones purport to provide.  Instead, read this review as being the experience of your average consumer who loves music, and can tell the difference between headphones that sound good, sound great, sound average, and sound below average.BUILD QUALITY:  The headphones appear to be well built.  They have some metallic pieces which give them a nice solid feel, and the cable has a good rubbery, tactile feel.  It certainly feels stronger and more durable than your iphone earbuds, and pretty much any set of standard ear buds you'll find.  Good marks here.SOUND QUALITY:  Totally bleh!  They don't have great bass.  I suppose it's a little better than what you'd expect from ear buds, but it's nothing to write home about.  The highs and mids are a little tinny.  They're clear, and you can understand them, but they have a slightly artificial sound to them.  When you're buying premium ear buds, this should be the most important feature.  Sadly, it's their least effective.iPHONE COMPATIBILITY:  I'm totally hit or miss with this.  The functions on the cable nub seem to work - volume up and down, track change, etc... however the mic rarely pics up my voice.  I don't mean that people have a hard time understanding me, I mean that my voice doesn't go through at all even if I speak directly into the mic.  Sometimes it works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  It's 100% random, and the majority of times it fails to function.  It seems to have gotten a little better with my new iPhone, but it still has connectivity issues.  Bummer.COMFORT:  With earbuds, it's always hit or miss whether they'll fit okay in my ear or not.  These come with so damn many little rubber options that I find it hard to believe you won't be able to find a piece that both fits your ear comfortably and keeps them in.  That said, the rubber thingies seem a little cheap, and one of mine already has a small tear.  They're comfortable, if not a little heavy, though I have concerns about long term durability of the inserts.  Fortunately, you have 999 backups since this thing comes with so many.OVERALL:  WAY too much money for what you get.  These are a nicely built set of headphones that seem like they'll last for the purposes of listening to music.  The sound quality doesn't justify the price, and the iphone functionality is sporadic at best.  I'd recommend you stay away if you're looking for a good sounding set of headphones, or a good set you can use with your iphone for talking purposes.  I can really only recommend these if you have expendable cash and are a huge fan of the beats brand, or really love the styling of them from a fashion perspective.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Has a few major flaws", "body": "I have had this mouse for two years now.Pros: The charge lasts quite a long time. The overall feel of the mouse in my hand is pretty good; it fit's well to my palm and better than your average mouse. The thumb buttons are great and well placed. Sensitivity is great...sometimes.Cons: There are many. First, the mouse has stopped charging and is now effectively dead. During the first week or so that I had this mouse I got a flashing amber light and noticed a burning odor. I looked at the contact point between the charger and mouse and found that it had partially melted. I've gotten this flashing warning light many more times since then but it didn't burn again luckily. There is the problem of \"bucking\" that I have never had with an optical mouse before. That is, the mouse pointer can skip across the screen and become very difficult to control if it isn't on a perfectly flat surface. I'm not sure if this is due to the fact that the size of the mouse requires you to hold it differently than a normal mouse or what, but it is extremely frustrating. The middle mouse button requires an unnecessarily large amount of force to push down. The size of the mouse makes it somewhat awkward to control. The four buttons below the middle button are useless as they are much too difficult to access during gameplay. Out of many, many games I've played I have not found one use for programmable macros.Why on earth does this mouse cost so much?!

{"title": "Wireless sub issues w/ interference", "body": "I bought this to replace a Sony soundbar w/ wired sub (HT-CT150) that worked well, however the logistics of running speaker wire from the sub to a &#34;dumb&#34; soundbar became too much after I rearranged our living room.  Enter the HT-CT260h, and the wireless subwoofer.  I had bought one previously for my parents in their house, and the installation/setup was a breeze.  We located the sub about 7 feet away with no line-of-sight obstacles from the bar, and I had no issues with the subwoofer dropoff that I now see are fairly widespread.  I bought another for my house, placed the sub about 6 feet away from the bar with no line-of-sight obstacles, and I can't seem to keep a sub signal to save my life.  Moved it closer (3 feet) to the soundbar on the opposite side, the problem gets worse with the green light completely changing to red (meaning that the sub's basically giving up)  BT, however, seems to be fine, oddly enough.  When I tried to engage Sony on this, my answer was, as was said on here, to remove all wireless networks from the room, or migrate all wireless devices to 5GHz (802.11a or n).  Again, not a feasible solution.  Just for kicks and gigs, I did a wireless scan of my parent's house (no intruding SSID's), vs. my house (about 15-20 scannable SSID's).  Clearly, I have a ton of 2.4GHz interference, and there's no telling my neighbors to &#34;migrate their wireless devices to 5GHz&#34;.  I understand that due to FCC rules regarding these sorts of things they can't exactly overrule outside interference, however what's the point of making a product that's able to be interfered with this easily, and because of this can't be used in a significant portion of homes in the US?  Or, given that possibility, not engineer some sort of workaround, such as a wired port that can be used?  I'd much rather run a single wire from the bar to the sub then a bundle like the HT-CT150, and if I'd known that the interference would be this crippling I would have bought a bar that enabled me to do this.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "I challenge a brain surgeon to apply this product correctly", "body": "I purchased this product after reading a review online stating that it offered the absolute best protection possible for the Ipod Touch. While that may or may not be true, one thing that is definitely fact and not fiction, is that it is virtually impossible to install this shield correctly no matter how adept your hand and eye coordination may be. I challenge a brain surgeon to apply this product correctly.

It took me less than 1 minute to install this wonderful screen protector and all without a single bubble under the plastic film. As bad as the invisibleSHIELD was, this product is absolutely superb and deserves 10 stars. You also have the choice of purchasing Power Support Crystal film set for iPod touch 2G, which probably works just as well. To protect the rest of the Ipod, I purchased Speck PixelSkin for iPod touch 2G (Black), also available on Amazon.

{"title": "Don't Bother", "body": "I ordered the Antec Portable Wireless Bluetooth speaker because I figured I could use it with my MacBook Pro. I did this in spite of a paucity of descriptive material and the lack of mention of \"stereo\" (I pride myself on being sensitive to omission). Alas...The Antec resembles a cowbell, albeit somewhat smaller. Why it has two handles is a mystery to me. It also includes a ridiculous clip, ostensibly so that one can use it anywhere (maybe around a cow's neck?). Its bizarre design, however, is merely the frosting on the cake. As per the instructions, I immediately attempted to charge the unit for 24 hours. Because my laptop was being repaired, I plugged it into an available USB port on my smart TV. I was disconcerted to observe that my TV didn't register its presence (unlike other items plugged into the ports, e.g. my iPhone) and that the unit didn't behave according to the instructions, i.e. no indication that it was charging (surely the factory charge must've drained a little). If I fiddled with its micro USB plug, it momentarily showed that it was charging and then \"nyet.\"I figured my best bet at that point was to see if it powered on and indeed, it did. Bluetooth on my laptop is always set to \"Discoverable,\" and I attempted to \"Set Up Bluetooth Device.\" This resulted in a persistent state of \"searching,\" despite the fact that the Antec was inches away. I thought perhaps I could salvage some use out of this hunk of junk by plugging it into the appropriate port on my Mac--that didn't work either (unless you count the nanosecond of crackling I heard out of one side of the unit). I resolved myself to the fact that I had yet another useless piece of electronic gadgetry on my hands that was ugly, to boot. Feh.I cannot recommend the Antec Portable Wireless Bluetooth speaker. If I received a defective unit, chances are you will, too. In addition, while I realize that one doesn't need a stereo speakerphone (one of its purported functions), I can't imagine that one would want to hook up a mono speaker to a laptop, tablet, or whatever. In short: give the Antec a pass should it come your way. The only upside for me was that I didn't pay for it.", "rating": "neg"}

The volume control will change the signal level going through the extension, but, unlike the Apple headphones, it will not adjust the device's volume level.  If the volume is turned way down on the device, it's impossible to use this extension to turn it up.The control button works in some cases but not others.  On an iPhone, the control button works just like the iPhone control button.  However, on an Apple Laptop the control button doesn't work properly (e.g., pausing and skipping in iTunes).The microphone does work in both cases.One rather significant downside is that if you use your regular Apple headphones with this extension, you will lose all of the functionality inherent in the Apple headphones.  The volume control, control button and microphone on your Apple headphones will not work through this extension.If you are looking for a good extension for Apple gear, I would suggest you keep looking.", "rating": "neg"}

So the only time this device will be really useful is if you are completely outside the range of your wireless router but within range of the range expander.

{"title": "Very poor instructions. Here is a \"secret instruction\" not mentioned, that you might need!", "body": "I bought the ASUS RT-N66R at Best Buy brick and mortar store, in case I had to return it. This is identical to the N66U, but the &#34;R&#34; indicates purchase from a retail brick and mortar store. I bought it because of the supposedly simple set up,etc. I give it 2 stars because of the difficulty I had in setting it up, and the very poor instructions. My router would not automatically launch  the set-up program. So, I tried using the setup wizard in the cd that comes with it. It seemed to go OK, but did not really match up with the setup example that I found on Youtube. Anyway, after completing the setup, the router would not connect the internet to my pc via WIFI, but it would connect when directly wired to my PC (Windows 7, HP Envy). I poured through all the different options, settings, etc. multiple times. The Windows Wizard could not fix the problem. I finally called ASUS. But, they do not provide help for routers on weekends.So, I tried something that I saw the guy do in the Youtube video that I found: instead of having both 2.5GHz and 5.0 GHz bands with same SSID name, I named each band separately (but used the same password for both). THIS WORKED!  For my pc, I must name each of the two bands with a different SSID name!Nowhere in the instructions does it say you must give a separate name for the 2.5 and 5.0 GHz bands. In fact, in the setup, you can check a box that automatically enters the same name and password for the 5.0 GHz band as you put into the fields for the 2.0 GHz band. The Youtube demo also did not specifically say you must do this. But, the demonstrator did name his bands separately, such as &#34;ASUS2.5 band&#34; and &#34;ASUS5.0 band&#34;. He didn't say why he did this, and he didn't say that it was important. But, I remembered that he did it. I don't know if all pcs require this, but mine sure did. So, maybe that info can help someone out there.So, after spending hours trying to get the ASUS router to work, it now seems to work fine. The instructions are terrible. In fact, the Quick Start Guide that comes with it fails to mention that you must first turn on the router by pressing the power switch! My previous router dd not have a power switch (so I wasn't expecting one), and the power switch on this router is tiny, black (the whole unit is black) and easily missed. I couldn't understand why no lights were blinking when I knew it was plugged in, until I found this little button and gave it a try. Why not simply have basic, clear instructions, ASUS? Instruction #1: &#34;find the power button and press it.&#34; I give this idea to you free, no charge.

I've stacked it up to both more expensive radios that I own and less expensive ones (CCRadio2, Kaito KA009S, Radio Shack Optimus PLL 12-808, Midland ER102MO, two table radios - Bose Wave Radio, and Kloss Tweeter label).

I will admit that my vision is not as sharp as it was in my youth so I asked my family and next door neighbor to help me. We started off trying the Wi-Fi clone method. We noticed the illustration of a router on the Quick Installation Guide that had an arrow pointing to a tiny circle. With the help of a powerful magnifying glass we were able to overcome the ink shortage and noticed that the circle had  imprinted on it the letters WPS. My routers do not have WPS so we decided to use the method outlined on the back of the Guide. We were unable to decipher the tiny instructions listed in the box labeled TP-LINK so we chose to try the miniature CD disk. From the CD we were able to obtain the SSID.We proceeded to follow the instructions to build a new Wi-Fi network. The main purpose of this effort was to extend service to a room that was the farthest from the router. When we finished the installation we tried out various equipment in this remote room but nothing worked.  As a last resort I called my granddaughter to come over and take a look at our effort and provide advice. She is a tech and is a highly paid employee of a company that provides tech service. In a nutshell, she could not get this to work.I have read reviews that say they have been successful in using this product but for me it is a no-go.

{"title": "Check the math if you don't use GPS", "body": "I use the foot pod with the FR70 non-GPS watch. I run known-distance courses, and my intent was to get information on cadence and stride length. Unfortunately, this combination of products does not seem to be able to provide this, at least with Garmin's mathematically suspect software. The distance varies depending on the speed at which I run (no surprise there -- if you vary your stride length, no foot pod will be perfect) BUT the software also does some bizarre correction to my cadence, which also makes those numbers unusable. The math should be pretty straightforward: I take X steps in Y minutes, I know how to do division, I get my cadence. The values spit out by Garmin Connect (the software we're encouraged to use) are often very far from reality. I know this because I will take a run where I actually count the steps I take. Also, although it doesn't get into the software reports, if you check the 'History' on the watch, you can get a field called 'Steps', which seems to be pretty accurate. So somehow Garmin takes a known time, and a known number of steps, and converts it into a cadence value that is not accurate.I'd guess that the pod is useful for people who have a GPS watch, and who run unknown distances. It would probably also work for people who run all their miles at the exact same pace. For me, a $10 pedometer is more useful. It could also be useful if you run on different treadmills all the time that are calibrated differently, and you want a consistent (though probably not accurate) way of measuring distance and cadence.On the plus side, it seems to be a pretty secure design, and I move it from shoe to shoe very regularly without incident.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Very sluggish, poor low-light shots", "body": "I bought this camera at Costco, as the replacement for my five years old Fujifilm F10 camera. And I was expecting to get something better at least in some aspects. But I am completely disappointed by this camera.Pros:- Relatively compact.- Good zoom, sharp shots with zoom if you have enough light.- Wide angle, useful for taking pictures indoors, or group portraits.- Good video quality.- Charged from USB.Cons:- Very sluggish - trying to take pictures of my kids. Kids run away before the camera focuses and takes a shot. It takes years to zoom in/out.- Poor performance in low light (even with regular room lighting). All photos are blurred, image stabilization doesn't really help. (A real disappointment compared to Fujifilm F10...)- Auto mode is disappointing. It doesn't allow changing white balance settings, and automatic white balance doesn't really work. All pictures I took at home (with warm luminescent lighting) turned to be reddish. Off course you can use manual mode or scene mode, but it will require some time to switch to that mode and adjust settings. And I really wanted point-and-shoot functionality.- Mode dial location (or shape?) is bad. It easily gets turned while taking camera out of the case.- Flash location (but it seems that many cameras these days have flash located near the grip) it easily gets covered by hand when holding the camera, takes some time to get used to it.- Custom and short USB cable (Samsung loves custom cables ;-), no video cable provided.Recommendation: If you're looking for a compact zoom camera, go to a real store and compare to Panasonic ZS* series, Fujifilm F80EXR, or Sony DSC-H55 and Sony DSC-HX5. I returned this camera and got Fujifilm F72EXR instead (it doesn't have HD video and only 10x zoom, but otherwise the performance is much better).", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Not as good/easy as \"advertised\"", "body": "My feelings/observations pretty much echo what others have said about this device:It looks and feels cheaply made.Doorbell sounds are \"cheesy\" and do not include a \"standard\" ding/dong.To the person at the door, this is not obviously a doorbell system.50' of connecting cable is not as much as you might think and can be somewhat limiting.  A maximum run of 100' is simply not good enough for some houses.  Were I to install this so I could monitor the front door from my basement, 100' would barely reach the desired location for the receiver/monitor.The description indicates you can use your existing doorbell wiring to connect everything \"within minutes.\"  Guess these guys have never been in an attic to connect to/troubleshoot doorbell wiring.  The worst part is that the installation/instruction \"manual\" does not include information as to how to connect the device to your doorbell wiring or whether an existing transformer will power everything.  It also does not say if your other door buttons and chimes can be left connected or not.  Additionally, if you want to use the monitor you must run the wire *somewhere* that you can access the system.  For most people this means surface wires or use of wall-trace unless you want to \"fish\" the wall to install the required wiring.  If I were to replace the current chimes with the monitor it would be at the ceiling.It works OK, but *just* OK.  Video is poor and washed out looking.  As another reviewer said so well: \"The picture is good enough to tell if you recognize the person at the door, but not good enough to describe a stranger to the police.\"  Once connected the video duration is just long enough to tell who's there but *not* enough to have any sort of conversation if needed.  The audio is somewhat \"hollow\".I was really wanting to use this for my home-bound Mother-in-Law (also hard of hearing) so she could tell who is at the door before unlocking/opening it.  Because of the somewhat non-existant \"integration\" instructions, that the unit looks and feels cheap, and the fairly poor audio/video quality I just couldn't bring myself to subject her to the hassle.", "rating": "neg"}

Overclock forum members mention getting free replacement boards for their monitors and that it's an easy item to replace. Additionally, as seen in thissimilar monitor's comments from the same seller, other customers are critical of the power supply and someone had to get an amazon refund due to lack of response from the seller.It's really too bad as this screen has a fantastic image, so I contacted the seller and asked what I can do to fix it.Seller replied and I sent the requested video. But they didn't answer about the return period. If it's 10 days, I've only got 2 left... that's not good news. If it's not blink-free before return period ends, it's going back.Measured the power supply and it's 24.7 V. It also has 3VDC from the \"negative\" pins to the metal shell on the connector. That's scary enough I chose not to see how much AC is floating on ground. The aforementioned other reviews talk about removing the ground pin from the power supply. Just that it has 3 volts on the ground shield is enough reason not to connect the monitor to a $500 nVidia gpu.As suggested by the seller Itried a new DVI cable(thank you Amazon for letting me order it last night and it's here at work today).I can confirm thatDP->DVI cabledoes not work even though it has the proper pins on the DVI end. Also, the monitor has DVI-D input: [:::::::: - ] so a proper Dual link DVI-I cable with [:::::::: :-: ] doesn't work. Clear explanation on this website: networktechinc.com/blog/dvi/276/Review raised to 2 stars because seller replied.Pros: Amazing panel from LG. CAD work looks better than ever. Fast shipping.Cons: Creepy 24VDC power brick. Crossover's history of faulty LED driver boards.

When I ordered the replacement for it through Amazon for a 2,600 mile trip, it had many faults.1st - I could drive 10-25 miles before it would find the satelites.  Which caused some missed turns, and a lot of frustration.2nd - Twice during the trip it almost caused an accident.  The first was in Dallas.  It told me to go towards the Waco interstate (I-35?) downtown.  That exit was on the far right, then all of a sudden it switched to the Shreveport/Texarkana exit which was on the far left within a .25 mile of the turn.  Getting across the 6 lanes of rush hour traffic was not fun.  Then in New Orleans, I was on US 90 and it told me to take a left and then a quick right to follow US 90 BUT several weeks before they had changed the road!  I followed the GPS directions and found myself entering an EXIT do not enter.  I had to jump the medium to get out of that one.  Luckily, it was 2 am and no traffic.3rd - When I followed the instructions in the book to reset to factory presets - nothing happened.  To make sure it wasn't just me, I had three people that own Garmins to try to reset it for me.  No Joy!4th - when trying to type in a street or city name I had to play with the keys.  Up and too the right on some rows of keys, and down and to the left on another row.  ????  Went through the troubleshooting diagnosis to calibrate the keyboard - didn't work!

{"title": "Joining the chorus", "body": "My setup:- I connected the drive to a router and the router to the computer using ethernet cables.- I have a Macbook and used the Time Machine backup feature.- I have iTunes and an iPad, and I used the iPad's \"Seagate Media\" app.The backup experience:- The initial Time Machine backup was estimated by the computer to take about 16 hours on my first try, when I had the router connected to the Internet.- I had to interrupt the first attempt at backing up, and on the second try it was necessary to power-cycle my laptop before I could properly connect again.  (This morning, I also had to power-cycle before I could connect properly.)- The second attempt, with no Internet coming through the router, took about 8 or 9 hours.  It was unclear whether the backup was resumed (as it should have been) or restarted from the beginning, because the status bar started at zero.- To return the machine, I decided to delete the backup.  That is also taking a very long time (about half an hour so far).Other limitations with the backup system:- You can't simply attach your computer to this drive using a USB cord.- If you needed to migrate to a new computer or lost all your data and needed to bring it back via backup, I don't think it can be done as simply as with a USB drive.  I am pretty sure it can't be done at all, in fact.- I was unable to navigate inside and look at the backup folders as I was with my simple USB drive.- It was nice that the thing is set up to be a Time Machine AND a media storage system.The Seagate Media experience:- I copied an iTunes video of an hour-long TV episode to the drive.  This only took a few minutes.- My iPad \"Seagate Media\" app easily found the Seagate drive on my network.- When you want to watch a video in Seagate Media, the ONLY way to do it is in Safari, the iPad's browser.  Which, as so many people lament, does not have a full-screen feature!- On the plus side, the video loaded and started playing almost immediately.  The whole thing would take it a while to load, but as long as you watch it in order from beginning to end, there's no problem.In the end I figured this thing is really not worth it.

{"title": "Not a good product.", "body": "I bought a powered splitter (CELabs AV400COMP) and 25', 50' and 75' cables, all to distribute a DTV signal.The 25' (this cable) and 75' (from the same vendor) cables I received are small wire/shielding.The 50' (maybe this vendor but now says ELMENOS) cable I received is a larger wire/shielding and much stiffer.I hooked everything up and immediately there was a problem with the 75' run.  Wanting to know if it was the splitter or the cables I tried several combinations including taking the splitter out of the setup.DTVBox/splitter/75'/TV (my first combo) was really bad ghosting. Did not know if it was the splitter or cable.DTVBox/75'/TV- took the splitter out, no real improvement so I know the cable is a problem. The 75' cable will not even send an adequate signal direct from the box.DTVBox/splitter/25'/TV- just OK, not great, some degrade.DTVBox/splitter/50'/TV-very good screen.DTVBox/50'/splitter/50'/TV- still a decent screen and this with a total of 100' of run.So the 25' and 75' cables are going back. The 50' I will keep.I looked at the ads to try to determine if there is any way to know whether a purchase will provide thin or thick cables. I don't think so. The 25' and 75' pictures show thick video cables like the 50' I got while the 50' picture shows the thin crap I got with the 25' and 75'.  The only description difference I could find was the 25' and 75' said &#34;ultra flexible&#34; which they were but the lack of shielding rendered them useless.

{"title": "Poor Feature Set, Horrible Implementation, Poor Support", "body": "This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased. I was looking for a wired, gigabit, ethernet router with QoS and a good SPI firewall. This was the only product I could find. Here's a list of the problems I ran into. I spent hours trying to configure it and had multiple conversations via chat and e-mail with linksys support. Their standard response was: \"Hold the reset button down for 30sec to restore factory settings and restart the router.\"1. Hosed my Windows XP Workgroup - after I installed the router I couldn't see any other machines on my network. I turned off all the firewall settings and it didn't make any difference.2. You can have logs and DoS alerts e-mailed to you. You enter an e-mail address and an smtp server. There's no place to enter authentication info for your smtp server. Yahoo and Google both require a user id and password. Linksys tech support had no clue.3. I couldn't find settings for MAC address filtering. You can setup firewall rules and specify computers that are allowed/not allowed but no place to restrict access to certain MAC addresses.4. You can't ask the DHCP server to issue the same IP address (based on the MAC address). So if you want the equivalent of fixed IP you need to do that on your PC. That's kind of tough with other devices like Media Extenders and IP Cameras.I could go on. Overall I'm not happy with this purchase and I'm going to see if I can return it.

{"title": "Buggy, poor feature set", "body": "UPDATE:  I am dropping this piece-o'-junk down from its meagre two stars to a single one.  I'd like to give it zero.The latest bug to crop up is occasional audio dropouts.  They only last a second, and sometimes they are infrequent (and sometimes less-infrequent).  It's like someone hit \"mute\" for about 3/4 of a second.  It happens with both media files on the USB stick and DVD discs.  It's actually been happening with audio files (a short dropout at the beginning of the play, and then one more about 30 sec. into the MP3 file, then no more after that) since I got it, but that seemed minor enough that I didn't mention it earlier.  Now the problem is spreading.I remember back when you could buy a piece of electronics with \"Sony\" on it and be assured of good quality.  Then it came to mean \"okay quality.\"  Nowadays, I guess it means nothing.  This thing is garbage and I am simply going to write it off and replace it with something else.The rest of my previous review is below:================================================================================================================I've had this player for about 7 months now and this is a revision (downgrade from three stars to two) of my original review, based on greater familiarity.The big selling point on this player, for me, was the wired streaming capability.  The player as Blu-Ray player works fine.  Big deal.  Streaming and media playback from USB?  Not so much.To begin with, the player \"pretends\" to be up and running before the network has come online.  So if you try to start a streaming application right away as soon as you can see the menu, it will tell you that the network is not responding.  I have verified that this is just slowness of the interface configuration by examining traffic on the other end of the wire.  Let it sit for an additional ten seconds or so and this won't be a problem, but it's a big annoyance and bad user interface design.  If you're not ready to stream, DON'T SHOW THE STREAMING OPTIONS.Netflix streaming is highly unreliable.  Blame DRM for all the silly hoops players have to jump through in order to access online content.  This player deals with the \"hoops\" almost as badly as most PC streaming apps, and that's saying a lot.  I am often getting kicked off of content in mid-view.  Sometimes it \"remembers\" where I was in the program and lets me back in at that point, sometimes it doesn't.  Rewind and fast-forward are clunky and very, very slow -- again, thanks to DRM restrictions on buffering and/or poor memory allocation on the part of the player.  There is no excuse for a device in 2011 to have problems in this area.  Finally, I frequently try to access Netflix content -- content for which I PAY by subscription, I remind you -- and wait several minutes only to see the error message, \"This device is not enabled to play this protected content.\"  Huh?  Then I try again and it's the same crapshoot -- eventually, I guess it always works (I have yet to be truly unable to get into a movie or TV show), but it sometimes takes three or four tries, which means you can waste ten minutes just trying to *start* a movie.  This is unacceptable.Playing MP3 files from USB?  It works, sort of.  I have no idea why some MP3 files are visible and playable when I put the stick in the front USB port, but not when I put the same stick with the same content in the back.  Why I can go down four directories worth in THIS part of the structure, but the MP3 files four directories down in THAT part are not visible or playable.  Huh?Search function for your 1,000 or so media files?  Forget it.Worst of all, maybe:  NO SHUFFLE PLAY.  Seriously?  I have 350 MP3 files in my \"pop\" directory, and if I want to listen to them I have to listen to them all in the same order every time, no randomization possible?  This is a feature that has literally been around in every other digital media player since, like, 1985!  No, really, I was an early adopter of CD and my FIRST PLAYER way back then could shuffle the tracks if I wanted it to.  And here in 2011, Sony releases a player without any attempt to implement this rather basic feature?  Kinda poor, you ask me.", "rating": "neg"}
{"title": "Avoid this product and marketplace vendor", "body": "I've had this for about a month. It arrived in a plain box, scuffed and abraded, without a single shred of paper. No instructions, no information about the manufacturer and the supposed 1 year warranty. Not a very impressive way to start off.The unit appears to be pretty well made. No obvious cheapness visible externally. Setup on Windows 7 64-bit was as it should be, a no-brainer. There are lights for each pair of USB ports around the circumference of the device. All the lights are dim and difficult to see. Some glow red, some glow green. Since there is no documentation, I don't have a clue as to what the lights are supposed to signify. Doesn't seem to have anything thing to do with whether one or two ports are in use. All the devices mounted are USB 2.0.Some of the ports don't seem to work. For those that do, operation is so far flawless.I've emailed the seller I purchased from asking about repair or replacement. We shall see. The poor packaging, the scuffed exterior, the lack of documentation are leading me to conclude I am better off returning this item, though I dearly need a 24 port hub.After communicating with the seller, I think I've figured out why my unit arrived abraded, scuffed and without documentation: they are shipping used units that they have \"repaired\". Despite the claim of a 1 year warranty, they are demanding a 30% restocking charge, shipping for the replacement unit as well as my paying for shipping it to them. In other words, I would be paying just a couple of dollars less than the price of a new unit - to get another used unit that they claim they will check before shipping.I can't speak entirely to the quality of the unit itself.

{"title": "Another user with autofocus and other problems", "body": "Before I bought this camera I only saw rave reviews, so after having focus issues with my old t2i, I upgraded to the 7d for it's advanced focusing system. WHen I received it and paired it with my 17-55 f.28 USM, I immediately took some snapshots around the house and outside. Everything was out of focus. Clearly I had something set up incorrectly right? No. I'm an experienced photographer and know how to work a camera. I only use spot focus or single point focus on still subject, which are what I mostly shoot. It seemed that my camera was front focusing. The farther away subjects were, the more the camera front focused. Or was it? It seems that some photos backfocused, front focused, and on occasion would somewhat nail focus but the pictures still appeared soft. Yes- my shutter speed was more than high enough to avoid camera shake or motion blur. In fact, some of thse photos were indoors using flash. Maybe my lens was out of adjustment? I ended up finding that a +15 microadjustment helped SOME of the time, however at different focal lengths, subject to camera distances, and even if you took a few shots of the same subject at the same distance, the autofocus was different in every photo. I then tried my 17-55 on my friends t2i. Spot on, every time, every distance, at every aperture. Houston, we have a problem. Not to mention it is then that I noticed that with identical settings (tested with evaluative and spot metering to the same exposure level), my 7d is also underexposing pictures by almost a full stop compared to the T2i my friend has. I looked up these issues online and that was when I found out that there are many other people having both of these exact problems. \"random focus\" and underexposure. My 7d is currently at the newport news service center...only time will tell if they return it in a usable state. From what I have read of others experiences, I will most likely receive the camera with the same problems. I don't doubt that there are some excellent 7d's out there, but be aware that there ARE a lot of lemons out there. I was lucky enough to get one, and you might be too.Another note: the noise at low iso's is terrible. My t2i put out much cleaner files, strangely though because they share a similar sensor.The fact that canon let this camera through quality control and it ended up on a store shelf gets it a one star review.

It's recommended by testers because it offers the same durability as some of the bulkier counterparts.Cons: It's not for everyday use.  For instance, the touch screen is (a LOT) less responsive once in the case.  If you think you can go between cases pending on your situation think again because you have to take off any screen protector you had on it for the screen to be responsive inside the case.  In fact I had to peel off both front and back.  Also, the new iOS 7 for the iPhone has a new control center you can access by swiping from the bottom of the screen and up.  You can't access this when the phone is in the Incipio case even if your life depended on it.

{"title": "Great Remote with a failing grade", "body": "I've owned the 880 for more than a year. It is the first remote my wife and I have both found simple to use and simple to set up. I could quibble about the buttons being too small, but overall the remote is a good product.The failing grade is the result of a miserable piece of junk that is called the cradle/battery charger. It is a disaster. If you're lucky, you'll get one that actually charges the remote. Or you might get one that is fiddly and that takes shifting it around until you finally get a charge going.Or you might suffer through a frequently discharged battery because someone walked through the room with a heavy foot -- and then find yourself with a charger that is dead and not easy to replace if at all. Mine failed completely after making me miserable for a most of the time I;ve owned the 880.The design concept might or might not have been good, but the execution in any event is bad.  You can look on all sorts of forums and you'll find this is a common problem. Among myself and three friends who bought this remote, only one of us received a charger cradle that has worked with some consistency. And it's not great. That's only 25 percent. A local video store says it carries this remote but actively discourages its purchase because of this problem. They do recommend other Harmony remotes.I also have a Harmony 720, a Costco special. It does most of what the Harmony 880 does, i.e. it has less backlighting and small things. It costs a good bit less. And wonder of all, it has a cradle that at least consistently charges the battery. It works.In fact, were it not for the 720, I would have had to toss the 880. I use it to charge the 880 battery (the batteries can be swapped between the two). The design uses only two contact points and it does not require a lot of fiddling about.But I would not buy either of those remotes again despite their capability. The battery charger issue and Logitech's failure to stand behind its products is just too frustrating. This is a competitive field and there are other remotes with better support in terms of quality control.The only point here is that if you buy the remote, you'll like it. If you're lucky, you'll get a battery charger that works correctly. The 880 is a little like a Ferrari with an empty gas tank and no service station for a thousand miles.", "rating": "neg"}

I sent it back to Nintendo, and they refused to cover it under warranty, saying that the warranty does not cover physical damage. This gamepad suffered a gentle fall from the armrest of a child's gaming seat to a padded and carpeted floor from a height of less than sixteen inches.  My wife bumped the gaming seat and the gamepad fell off of the armrest onto the floor.  Ever dropped your phone, ipad, etc. from 16 inches?  Did the screen fail?  Probably not.  Can an electronic device that is ostensibly designed for play by children be so pathetically designed that it cannot tolerate a gentle 16 inch fall onto padded carpet?  Apparently, that is the case with this product.  Or at least that is what Nintendo's response reasonably implied, as their \"technician\" had determined that the product failure was due to \"physical damage.\"  You see, you are at their mercy as to the determination of what is and what is not a covered repair.  You send it to them and they just tell you that the problem is caused by physical damage and they aren't covering it under the warranty.  They assured me that they were not lying, BTW.  They kindly give you the option of paying for the repair of having the device sent back to you.Is there not a reasonable amount of jostling and impact that should be expected for a device like this?  Apparently not.  I could understand their position if the device had been tossed across the room, thrown, dropped from a reasonable height onto a tile floor, etc., but this is simply pathetic.

{"title": "What's the point?", "body": "Zentral AV Remote Control arrives in a tiny box and the actual Zentral Receiver is even smaller, which is good for those of us who don't like large gadgets filling up the entertainment center. The receiver uses Bluetooth commands from the Blackberry and translates them into infrared or IR commands to control the devices.There are 3 ways to set this thing up - using the IR emitter wire, using the receiver's built in IR emitter or a combo of both methods. In order to use the built in emitter, the manual states that devices have to face the Zentral Receiver or be directly above it. The wires are good if you have an entertainment center that conceals your devices.The manual does warn that the placement of the receiver is very important if you want to use the built in emitter. However, my receiver was smack dab in FRONT of the TV and cable box, and I could not get it to work. After some hassle, I connected up the receiver with the included IR emitter wire. I don't have hidden shelves and all my devices are out in the open, so I would not be happy with this arrangement long term. The receiver pairs up with the Blackberry fairly easily, and downloading the Blackberry app was simple as well.What I found to be a real pain was setting up the AV Remote account and then setting up the Blackberry app with all the devices.

It took a lot of effort to try to jam it in there, and it wouldn't quite go down far enough for the tab to snap into place.  I know it shouldn't be like that because I later got another adapter that snaps in easily and fits perfectly.If you have a spare 6-pin cable and need an 8-pin, I recommend getting a 6-pin to 8-pin adapter instead.(EDITED after 3 attempts to find the right adapter.)", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Run... run away", "body": "We've had one of these for about a year and a half now. Purchased it through another retail outlet. In concept, it's great, but in practice, it has numerous problems.First off in terms of durability, the battery and charging system is an Achilles heel. Instead of charging through the USB port, it charges through a dedicated plug that is incredibly fragile. Put in the hands of a youngster, it doesn't stand a chance. We've had to replace the charger/cable twice now.If that weren't bad enough, the battery on ours has ceased to accept a charge twice. The first time it was returned and replaced within the 1 year warranty period. I have now had to return it a second time and and still awaiting replacement. I can't get an update on the status from their customer service and it has been over a month.With regards to the operating system itself, it's very cumbersome. For web surfing it is incredibly restrictive with the included browser. A parent pretty much has to sign in and approve every URL. My oldest kid got so frustrated with it that she quit using it.The solution is to update to the latest available Android OS and install Google Chrome. Unfortunately, this leaves the browser wide open with no parental controls available (at last check anyway).I think the sweet spot for user age is from 4-7. My four year old got some use from it when he was three. My oldest old pretty much outgrew it before her 9th birthday, although she she likes it to play games from the Google Play store.Another source of irritation is if you want to set up multiple kid profiles. The kids can't switch between profiles themselves. You've got to log in with Mommy/Daddy password to switch it for them. And if you set a time limit, you can't switch kid profiles without resetting the time limit first.Finally, the customer service is pretty much awful. To get any response, you need to post on the Nabi Facebook page.Wish I could recommend a better option. Haven't tried very hard to find one though. My oldest is almost 10 and has pretty much out grown it. She has started using a hand me down Kindle Fire, but I've got to get some better parental controls in place. My youngest is four and was starting to use the Nabi before it crapped out this last time. Hoping to get it back so he can use it while we work on finding something better. In the meantime, he plays games on mom's iPad and his Leap Pad.Update 4/30/14: After this last battery issue, they sent us yet another replacement unit at no charge.

I was not looking for the machine to do more than the basics in terms of word-processing, movies and Internet access.  I purchased the Windows anytime upgrade with the machine, and the memory chip.  I'm pretty handy with a computer and don't typically need assistance in doing minor tasks such as installing memory or software.Let me get right to the point: The processor was too slow to handle on-line games such as the type you can find on Pogo or Facebook.  Streaming video via Netflix wasn't bad, but definitely needed patience; the same goes for the Amazon Unbox.  I actually had better reception and play on the Netflix app on my iTouch.  Within 2 weeks of getting the netbook, I began having issues with the battery and the AC adapter.  We tried purchasing another adapter, but despite it listing the Asus on the box, it did not fit the machine.  By week 4, the battery was completely shot, and the system information was telling me to purchase a new battery.A friend of mine grabbed all of my information off the hard drive for me, and I proceeded to call ASUS.  ASUS referred to me the closest authorized repair center for their products which is in Gibsonia, PA.  I live in Northern VA, and can't drive right now because of the surgery.  I explained this to them, and was told that was all they could offer, because it was likely a user-caused issue.Amazon took care of the issue promptly, but I doubt I'll ever consider another ASUS machine.

This one will have mixed reviews and my advice is to go to local stores and try it before you buy it or order it directly from Zagg which they have 45 days return policy.My biggest problem is it will scratch your Ipad in 3 places after multiple use. There is a small plastic notch in the center and on each side of the hinge that will hold your Ipad very tight. In another review it was suggested to file them but I'm afraid that the Ipad will get loose.It is very hard to place or take out the Ipad from the hinge and once you place it you have to push it all the way in and because the Ipad is held by the hinge like a clamp and not by a magnet this will scratch your ipad like I said above after multiple use + you need to adjust/center the ipad with the keyboard once you attached them which will increase the possibility of scratching the ipad.My daughter had the Logitech model for ipad 3 and it is very easy to attach to the magnet hinge, this one it is done thru friction. Definitely you can't use  screen protector unless you trim the screen protector about 1/4  before installing it to allow a space for the hing.On the other hand, the back-lit keys is a great feature but my 2nd daughter only uses the Zagg once she wants to type and not as a case, she finds it hard to attach and dis-attach.Again, this will have a mixed reviews so please let me know if you have any questions.My 2nd option is to get Logitech which also has mixed reviews but it looks like the recent ones are more positive but before I buy it I'll will go to Best Buy and try it.

{"title": "Careful, this cam system requires a $50 per year service plan fee to view remotely", "body": "What a disappointment, I'll be comparing it to myD-Link DCS-932L mydlink-Enabled Wireless-N Day/Night Network Camera. I had really wanted to like this camera and to be able to put it near the front door to see the front yard. Netgear offers an outdoor casing accessory (additional purchase) to put it outside so it isn't effected by inclement weather.I do love the small size of the netgear camera and that it is truly wireless (runs on batteries, lithium cr123a). These batteries aren't easy to find everyplace though. Amazon sells a 6 pack for about $13. Netgear claims that the battery would last 6 months with 5 minutes of daily use. The D-link has a plug so there's no worries of batteries dying especially while your away just in case you forgot to change them out.You have to hook up the base unit to your router system as there is no software for your computer and this is the reason for the base station as it handles the communication from the cam. The extra base unit, takes up more desk/counter space and really is unnecessary in my opinion compared to d-link.I have no connection issues with my d-link and it was just as easy to connect with the connection wizard via the website. Once the cam (d-link) is connected to the mylink website, you can remove the cat5 cable and its done without the addition of a base unit.The video quality isn't as good as the D-link, which has infra red for night/total darkness video. The netgear does not have infra red and states that there must be at least a 40 watt light bulb to see anything in the room. Trust me, you need the infra red to compensate for low light with these small cams, they just aren't able to handle low light well.The netgear also does not have audio whereas the D-Link does and its fairly good. The range isn't that great either. My router is on the second floor in the office and the cam looses signal on the first floor in the living room where i have the d-link (that has no signal issues).The biggest issue with the netgear is you have to pay $50 a year for service to view on your smartphone or tablet. WHAT? yep the minimum \"service plans\" to view the cam's video remotely while away or at the office or where ever you may be, you have to get the service. The amazon page may get updated after I post this review but there is no description that states you have to pay for services. D-link is free and I can view the live video on my iphone and ipad from anywhere i wish to, including hearing audio. I generally like netgear products but at the price of $199 for this system the iPhone/ipad/android service should be free!!!!! And also the camera needs infra red for night viewing as well as audio.I really don't  understand netgears logic in charging for iphone viewing service, its a deal breaker for me because basically i'm paying for a service i'm not constantly using on a daily basis. For some people this may be fine and a small price to pay for piece of mind being able to check in on the house but why pay for something when you can get better service from d-link for free and its only $80 per cam and no base unit needed.Pros:-Truly wireless-Small size-Fairly easy setupCons:-Must pay $50 for remote iphone/ipad/android service-Terrible low light video/ no infra red-no audio-weak signal range-more expensive than other cams-addition of base unit for cam to work/not standalone", "rating": "neg"}

Thus I purchased this warranty as it was offered in conjunction with this item - USED item (note it was a reduced price as well as being sold in conjunction with the item).Square Trade informed me that they would not cover if USED, had to be new or refurb.  They had no offering in conjunction with Amazon that was to be utilized for USED items.OK, try again, maybe just not well informed rep.  Next call, nope, not covered, must be new or refurb.  For that matter not covered until 61 days.

Huh, not what the initial and surface reading on the ad referenced, appeared to be a special offering to protect the consumer specifically for the USED item sold in the Amazon Warehouse transaction from day 1, due to no manufacturer's warranty available (USED item).  For those that wonder, I have read it all, in its entirety multiple times....not having hallucinations.....OK, try again, this time even more interesting - 41 days until covered.....I give.....the speaker was blown in the item, was within the 30 day Amazon return frame, as much as I want the item, it is being returned.

Will purchase from Amazon, I suspect that this is not the fault of Amazon, just a sneaking suspicion that Amazon is under the same impression that I am, coverage for USED and starts from day 1 (due to no manufacturer's warranty available).Suggestion to the parties involved...get your story straight....either this offering IS or IS NOT applicable to provide warranty coverage of a USED item sold by Amazon Warehouse Deals....AND....coverage starts from day 1....41....or 61, take your pick, but inform accurately.Edit:Just went to the item (Square Trade) page for reference to this posting....chuckle, now changed to day 31....sorry guys I printed the original page that was offered in conjunction with the item.....yep it sez DAY 1.....please figure it out, get it straight, and get on the same line.

After install, my signal between the transmitter and receiver dropped to 2 bars. I think the signal meter has like 8 bars which I never paid much attention to as in the previous firmware version, it was all green.I contacted support again about the signal and they said to manually select channels. Once I got to the 3rd channel, I lost communication altogether. The guy on the phone told me to do a reset of the transmitter and receiver and start again which obviously becomes very frustrating. After trying all the channels, I never got one where it was all 8 bars of signal. The best I got was 3 and maybe one that bounced to 4 on occasion.In the end, I just spent a ton of hours trying to get this to work. It is super frustrating.

First problem that occurred was about a week into my 1st player.  The backlight mysteriously stopped coming on, so I couldn't see a thing in any sort of darkness.  I dealt with it about a month, then decided it was too annoying, and swapped it for a new one.  My 2nd player was working fine, but then about 2 months later, while it was charging, all of a sudden the screen froze, saying \"low battery\", and I could never get it off that screen again!  Something locked up, apparently.So, now, this is 2 broken Zune players in only a few months.  Each time I've had to completely re-load my Zune, and since I use 2 different computers, it's going to be a pain in the behind to re-load the music this 3rd time.  It's getting pretty aggravating.  I'm ready to just exchange this broken one for a brand new Zune (Thank You Extended Warranty!) and sell it to somebody.  I'm tired of an mp3 that breaks so easily.The battery life on this thing is PATHETIC.  It claims 20 hours or something absurd in the instruction manual is the battery life; I'm honestly lucky if I get 6 hours playback on it.  I'd think more like 4 hours would be a good guess.  It's worse than a discman for crying out loud!  I had a discman I bought for $19.99 that used to give me a good 10 hours playback.  Now a $129 MP3 player can't give me half that!?While I'm ranting, I also don't like the Zune software.  It loads TERRIBLY slow, and slows down your computer (I'm on a BRAND NEW, blazing fast laptop, FYI).  The Zune pass IS a great deal, I'll give credit where credit is due.Lastly, every once in awhile, I'll notice music randomly disappearing off my Zune player.  An entire album, GONE, out of nowhere!  It happens semi-frequently, with both Zune's I've had.  I go to look for a particular artist, and it's mystically vanished!I could go on and on a bit more, but I'll leave it at that.

{"title": "In Reality, an Anti-Green Laptop Charger.", "body": "This is a terrible &#34;charger.&#34; While some packages include travel adapters (which rocks), the main component isn't reliable at all. Let me explain.The design is that the little lit indicator button (in the middle of the green ring) can be pressed to turn the CHARGER itself on or off. Presumably, power transformers and chargers not being used draw a very small amount of &#34;wasteful&#34; energy. This is because the conductivity of the materials designed to be insulating electric current (e.g. the case) isn't ever perfect insulator. So, the &#34;green&#34; hippies decided to tell people to unplug their junk when they're done -- even the charger. I believe this kind of logic actually wastes electrical parts as they break sooner with increased fatigue stresses from the unplugging/replugging.Anyway, the iGo Green guys decided to turn the green movement into a project to make some green (dough, moolah, money, etc.) for themselves... they said &#34;oh, let's just add a power button (relay?) to the chargers, and charge people more money for the product while we 'help' them 'feel better' about themselves saving the environment and stuff!&#34;The other primary feature of this charger, and the worst part, is that when the charger detects a decreased current draw from the unit it's charging, it shuts the charger off automatically. That means when you're laptop turns off, the charger turns off too. Unfortunately, that also means when your laptop battery finally reaches a full charge and draws only a trickle of electricity to keep it topped off, the CHARGER SHUTS OFF WITH YOUR LAPTOP STILL ON. This causes your laptop to, despite being plugged in, deplete its battery.So, not only does this &#34;charger&#34; end up draining your battery, it also causes it to cyclically fatigue and wear out faster (from all the charging/recharging). Imaging going to use your laptop and finding it dead. Fun stuff.Worst of all, charging and recharging a battery isn't 100% efficient. There are losses, I'd imagine greater than those involved in leaving a normal charger plugged in. (I am an engineer of a related discipline, and feel confident in that presumption.) So, while this product says it's green, it actually ends up being very un-green.So, you pay more, get a useless charger that always shuts off on you, and isn't even green (like it advertised). To me, there is only one reason to buy this product: You want to look like you're being green, without actually being green (while to the more analytical people actually looking like an idiot.)

{"title": "HP Elite HPE 410F  Don't buy HP", "body": "If I could give HP less than one star, it would have been negative stars. I guess the case looks nice and I can brag that we have a 6 core (if I don't explain the rest), giving it one star.I have had this HP Elite HPE 410f computer for several months. I guess I was expecting more from HP and a 6 core. On setup, I attempted to use a HDMI to DVI cable to take advantage of the digital monitor. It did not work and I spoke with HP Customer Support. The tech concluded that the cable was defective and I have used the VGA port since. Still don't know if the tech is correct or if it is the port.I never tried another cable.In August 2011, I again called HP Support because the HP computer would shut itself off without warning. Sometimes it could be rebooted and other times it would boot up days later. There was no rhyme or reason. At times, it would run for days and other times for a brief period.On the first call ref this problem, the computer would not act up, so the tech suggested that I call back when it did. Understandable. On the second call, a second tech asked me to turn off the computer after it did shut itself off in minutes. She kept asking me what the computer was doing while it would not reboot and I kept advising her, \"Nothing. That's the reason I am calling\". Once it rebooted, I was instructed to shut the computer off, to remove the cover and to remove the memory sticks. I was uncomfortable doing this as I am not qualified. But after following her instruction, she concluded that the \"motherboard was OK\" (see below tech bench assessment), but the computer had a hardware issue requiring warranty repair. I was given a HP Repair Service Case Number. She stated HP would be in contact within 24 hrs with instruction for return and factory service. I repacked the computer in the original packing carton and awaited contact.More than forty-eight hours passed and I again contacted HP Support. This time, I spoke with someone I could understand. This technician \"explained\" that there was nothing in the call notes to indicate the product should be returned. He wanted me to unpack the computer, set it up, and start it up for diagnostics---again! He would wait. I was calling on a cell phone and tried to explain the previous contact. I opted to end the call because after doing all of that while on the cell, it may not have acted up while I was on the call. We were also getting ready to make a major move and didn't want to lose the computer in the transition.In retrospect, losing this computer in shipment would have been a blessing.After making the move, we decided to pay a qualified technician at Staples to address the problem. The tech hooked up the computer to his monitor and while writing up the service order, the computer again failed within minutes. Two days later, the tech called stating diagnostics tests concluded it was a \"bad motherboard\" (so much for over-the-phone diagnostics). It would require that either the store repair it for a cost of approx. $250 or the computer needed to be return to HP for warranty. I believe it should be done under warranty as most of you would agree.Call #5 to HP Support and I was again talking a language barrier to HP tech support in India. This time I insisted to speaking with the supervisor. But first I had to go through the routine with the tech. After about 15 minutes on my cell phone, the supervisor came on to speak with me. I wanted to make certain that the conversation was being recorded and he advised it was. He also confirmed that he was a \"supervisor\". The next thing I got was his name \"Hari\". After a 40+ minutes long frustrating conversation, he insisted that I get the computer back from the store, set it up and get back in touch with \"HP Customer Support\" so that he could go through a diagnostics over the phone. I asked why on the second call for this issue, the tech concluded the computer hardware was defective and needed to be returned and we would have to go through all of this again. The supervisor stated that he had to do the diagnostics before authorizing a return. On concluding the call, the supervisor said to me, \"Thank you for choosing HP\". If only I had a blood pressure cuff when I hung up!!In conclusion, this HP computer was NOT PURCHASED from Amazon.com, but from a large national retailer box store. I did not choose to purchase extended warranty because issues usually happen in the first year--and I incorrectly assumed that HP would stand behind their warranty. Having done multiple transactions with Amazon has, each time, left me pleased with the results. This is being posted on Amazon, because buyers really need to rethink before purchasing anything HP. You may be fortunate and not have an issue with an HP product, but Heaven forbid if you do. This HP was purchased to replace a Sony Vaio that is 8 yrs old. The Sony is still running. The HP \"Elite\" HPE 410f is frustrating floor clutter equivalent to an empty banana box. At least the banana box served its intended purpose, is disposable, and didn't list at $800. So much for speed, upgrade, an American company---or the expectation of service if you need it..It's not that I can thank HP enough, it's that I can't thank them at all.I am fulfilling my promise to the HP Tech Support supervisor in submitting this review.Would I buy products again from Amazon? ABSOLUTELY!! Would I buy an HP product from anyone ever again? ABSOLUTELY NEVER...There is life after HP---and much less frustrating.", "rating": "neg"}

For me, I run multiple professional audio cards and have tried them all on this game.  From the Focusrite Safire Pro 40 to the Maudio Audiophile 2496, and even my every day PreSonus FP10 firewire interface!I can get through a song most of the time, and then BOOM! Static cruddy audio.  Even half way through a song this can happen causing the game to becoming very hard to play/learn on.NOWLet's move onto other things.  The in game tuner is ok at best.  I find it to tune quite higher and a bit off from my Boss tuner pedal so when I actually strum chords, they sound really bad.

It means when you're browsing a website and move your mouse down, the page scrolls a bit. When you're modeling something in SolidWorks and move your mouse quickly from one point to another, it zooms in/out. It seems like a minor thing, but it gets very annoying, VERY fast.The solution is to click the scroll wheel down to get it into \"clicky\" mode, but it's the worst scrolling experience ever I've ever had. It's very inconsistent--one click will sometimes scroll me down 100 pixels while the next click might scroll me down 40 pixels. Then there is the occasional scrolling rebound where it will scroll one direction, then rebound the other way one click.

Within 2 months of ownership, with average of 30mins of viewing per day (some days longer, some days of no watching), the TV would occasionally turn off and within seconds, turn back on. My son, who would be watching e.g. alone would call out saying TV turned off, and then reassure it is back on.About a few days ago, the TV started powering on/off every few minutes and would never stop doing that. I had the Ethernet cable connected, so I got the firmware upgrade done - thankfully the system upgraded the firmware and didn't go through power-cycle during that time. The firmware kept it stable for say half a day, then the power-cycles came back again. I checked the power outlets, cable connections etc. All other electrical systems (like receiver, HT computer all were stable).I google searched for this problem, and the issues have been all over the place. It was shocking. Customers state Samsung would replace the main motherboard and after after a few months, the same problems would re-appear. Some stated it was some cheap capacitors used on the boards that caused the issues. Problem was not limited to 46-inch display.I was within 90-day window and returned it to the store and bought the Sony edge-LED EX700 series 52-inch.

{"title": "Great but slightly flawed... 4 stars - EDIT - AWFUL DISTORTION", "body": "I chose this product instead of the Belkin alternative because I use Logitech for many of my needs and I trust the brand. Also, this one has a very useful \"Connect\" button, which is great for adding new devices.I notice no degradation of sound quality coming from a simple 3.5mm RCA Y-cable, and I grew up with my father's Ruark speakers on a fantastic turntable (so I'm quite capable in sound comparisons).I suppose I should explain the types of music I listen to - Metal, Rock, Occasional Piano-based music, etc. This wireless adapter plays it all fine. I notice it is a little light on mid/high or heavy on low, but still very pleasurable to listen to on Boston Acoustics A40 bookshelf speakers.There are only 2 small flaws in the way this product works. I have the HTC Droid Incredible 2 (an Android smartphone), and use it for all music-listening. The phone does not connect to this bluetooth device automatically unless I restart the phone. If I leave the house (lose connection) Android tells me that it is paired but not connected, and I have to tap the device in settings to connect. Then I play any song and it wirelessly streams to my stereo.The other flaw is a problem for some people but not all. Anybody using a wireless G router or wireless N 2.4ghz router may experience some interference. I use a wireless G router (an awful one, by the way), and my mom, one floor directly under me, noticed a drop in signal strength when I was streaming music. This is inevitable, seeing as bluetooth uses the same 2.4ghz radio that many wireless internet routers use. Connection was never lost for either of us, but she was concerned about the dropping of signal strength.I wholeheartedly recommend this $40 device for anyone looking to lose the cords, and I assure you you will not be disappointed with your purchase.EDIT: 10-16-11I just got a brand new MacBook Pro (2011), and have been using it with this adapter. It does have a bit of trouble connecting at first, and has some completely un called for drops mid-song. I'm docking the review down to 3 Stars because of this. Sound quality is better on my laptop than my phone, though.Also, I got a new router, that uses Wireless N. I use the 2.4ghz connection because it has better signal strength in my room. It is a much more powerful wireless antenna, and nobody in my house has complained of interference since the upgrade. I have not noticed any interference when using this adapter either, so that fixed one of my complaints. This would bump the review up to 5 stars, but the connection issues with my laptop will keep it at 4.I can still recommend this product, but you might want to try out a friend's first, or maybe try it out at a store, or be willing to return it to Amazon and pay return shipping. The bass is a little heavy with my laptop, but it can be adjusted.EDIT: 10-17-11Upon receiving many amplifiers and speakers (Pyle Mini 15w and 75w, Hercules XPS 30, and soon to get Eagle 2.1), I've determined that this bluetooth receiver has been the root of most of my complaints. When I first got it, it was definitely cutting out some of the bass and raising the levels of the bass not cut out, and I could live with that. This is half a broken rope. It still works, but its weak. The 2 Pyle amplifiers was the other broken half of the rope. Together, they distort miserably, and I can not stand it. I used a 3.5mm cable with my new hercules speakers, and all the distortion vanished, so I can only attribute it to this audio receiver. I can no longer recommend this device, at any price. I would return it, but it's been too long. I would stop using it, but my phone does not agree with most 3.5mm cables when hooked up to speakers (Don't ask why, but headphones are perfect). I would sell it to a friend, but I'm not that mean. Please, do not buy this product. I'm becoming a near-audiophile, and I'd rather listen on my macbook than on this.

{"title": "Lines on screen, flimsy locking mechanism. Warranty is not all it's cracked up to be.", "body": "I've been looking for a decent quality projection screen to use with my newly purchased LCD projector. Unfortunately, this is not a quality projection screen, It is a flimsy, made in China screen. It's cheap and if you require a screen for infrequent use, then this may do the trick for you. I've actually returned mine due to many issues that I discuss in my review.If you're not familiar with all the different sized screens out there you might be a little confused by what size screen to get. It's not that difficult to sort out but you need to consider a few factors before you can choose the most appropriate screen. First you must consider how far away you're going to have your LCD projector from the screen. The further away the projector is, the larger your screen will need to be. My projector is best when it's about 6-8 feet  from the screen.Next you must get a screen that is of a similar aspect ratio of your projector. In my case, I have a projector that has a resolution equal to a 4:3 aspect ratio. This is not HD resolution. If you have a HD resolution projector, you'll optimally want a projector that is wider than the height of the screen which can be either 16:9 or 16:10. There are also screens that are 1:1 aspect ratio (height and width are the same). Of course you can use any screen size for any projector, but you'll have un-used screen areas with a mis-matched screen and you won't be able to achieve the largest image on the screen if you don't have the right aspect ratio.The 84\" screen is perfect match for my projector. The screen has good reflectivity and is washable.The tripod legs are a quite a bit wobbly when setting up the screen and they do not have a locking feature at all.  There are two adjustments possible on the screen itself as you're setting it up: the top height of the screen, which is adjusted by loosening/tightening a cylindrical plastic adjuster on the vertical tubing. And the bottom height of the screen which is achieved by unlatching a relatively flimsy looking lever right above the handle. Once you set the height of the top, you then adjust the height of the bottom of the screen.One feature I appreciate about the screen is that you can snug the screen right up close to a wall if you wish by rotating the screen/handle once it's been opened. That enables you to either have the screen almost flush against a wall or have the rear leg pointing straight behind the screen and having minimal leg in front of the screen to make it less likely someone will trip on the extended legs. The stand also has a keystone adjustment which could be useful if your projector is unable to adequately correct for that.Realistically I think this screen is about as good as it could be for the price, which is to say, not that good at all. If you're looking for a more robust, better made screen you'll end up spending quite a bit more. In my case, I paid about 70 bucks more for a Da-Lite screen which is made in the USA in Indiana. For frequent use, that extra money may be well spent.A serious issue I have with the screen other than the flimsy lever is the fact that my screen had an appreciable series of horizontal, full-width ridges caused by the wrapping of the screen around the case cylinder. You can imagine that as the first edge of the screen is inserted into the cylinder that each subsequent wrap of the screen around the cylinder will have a slight bump as it goes over that insertion point. This is causing increasingly wider lines from bottom to the top of the screen as can be seen in the photo I uplodad in the user photos area.I've called Elite Screens about this and they claim those lines will go away after the screen has been left open for several days. That has not been my experience however. My screen has been open for over a week now and the lines have not diminished at all. And the 2-year warranty that sounds good on paper is not all that great when you take into consideration that the customer must bear the brunt of paying return shipping to Elite Screens. That is not acceptable. Why should the customer have to pay to return something that is defective? In fact, I've returned the screen to Amazon and Amazon has provided a UPS shipping label at no cost, something that would not have happened with Elite Screens directly.Once again, Amazon has pulled through, even better than the actual company that manufactures the screen!The screen seems a great value but the flimsy construction and poor return policy make it not nearly as good a deal as you think. The screen is made in China and is cheap and flimsy. A much better alternative, and what I've just received to replace the Elite Screen I'm returning is the Da-Lite84IN Picture King 50X67 Matte Wht 4:3 Video Tripod Screen. It is USA made and is much heavier duty, locking tripod legs that can be operated with your foot, and a much more substantial screen locking mechanism. You get what you pay for.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "ASUS = horrible quality assurance & display issues", "body": "I owned the first Nexus 7 and I would have to say that it's still quite the nifty performer. It has better battery life than the Nexus 7 2nd Generation. The thing that I noticed about most of the Android tablets I've owned (I've had an Asus Transformer Prime, a Nexus 7, and a Transformer Infinity Pad) is that after about 6-7 months, they all start to run SLOWLY. I've performed all the factory resets and updated every single app to its latest and greatest version, and for some reason, right around the time that new tablet with more impressive specs come around, the tablet runs slower. That's what happened with my Nexus 7 (2012). It got so sluggish to the point where I sold it, and got this new Nexus 7 (2013). It's slightly faster, the graphics have improved, but the battery life is so so (you seriously have to dim down the brightness and make sure you have a power outlet nearby if you intend to use it intensely and want it to last for more than 6 hours). My worry is that in about 6 months, this Android tablet will start running sluggishly again. I do own a Nexus 10. Despite the new Nexus 7 having 300+ ppi, I'd still have to say my Nexus 10 has the more beautiful screen of the 2. A 7\" tablet is just too small for me to pinch to zoom to read anything.  So I use my Nexus 10 more to read. But if you're looking for a decent 7\" tablet, this is by far the best one to get. I'm just not so sure about how it will perform in about 6 months when Google works on their 3rd generation Nexus 7.Update - 12/16/2013: I'm on my 3rd Nexus 7 2013.  The honeymoon ends real quickly after a week or two when you discover how poorly the quality assurance is with Asus and its line of products.  The \"light bleed\" issues with the display and touchscreen responsiveness have been horrendous.  My next 2 replacement Nexus 7's had WORSE light bleed than the original! I was wondering if this was a \"spit in the customer's soup\" type of response to me complaining about the N7's screen in the first place because the next 2 replacements were worse.  I would dare say that my first generation Nexus 7 did not have these many issues.  I think Google really needs to find a different manufacturer to make their Nexus line.  I love my Nexus 10 and that was made by Samsung. I wish Google would divorce themselves from LG and Asus to make their Nexus line and stick with Samsung. Why Samsung?  Well, Samsung manufactures the beautiful screens on Apple's products (aka: retina display - ironic that their main competition actually manufactures their screens).", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Lots of Potential--Mixed Bag", "body": "I considered myself a loyal Sandisk customer and I was very excited about the View.  I purchased one after it first came out.  I should have waited a year or so.The View has a lot of things I desire in a player.  It is a flash player with a lot of space.  Essentially, it is a beefed up E200 series in a much slicker package with a bigger screen.  The fly wheel is also very, very comfortable to use.  So, in terms of hardware and Audio, I love the View.It is the software where things get dicey.  The View's video playback looks washed out--or it seems that the tint is off. . .even on videos purchased from Amazon Unbox.  Also, it has an amazingly annoying tendency to freeze up when \"Play all\" and shuffle are used.  This is extremely annoying and more often than not, one has to restart the player.  This is also extremly annoying due to the fact that there are no dedicated volume controls--so if it freezes up, you cannot adjust the volume on the player (or do anything else for that matter).Now, what is even more annoying is that Sandisk seems to be ignoring these software issues.  When I first got the player, a firmware fix was promised.  Well, they issued a new firmware, but this essentially killed the battery life on the player and it did nothing to fix the freezing issue.  If you check the forums, including the one on the Sansa site, you see that this is a widespread problem.  It has been a long time since any new firmware has been issued--it seems that Sandisk is basically moving forward and ignoring the people who purchased this product.  I have been extremely dissapointed with Sandisk as a company in regards to their support of this player and I am not sure if I will buy another Sandisk product.So, overall, I would not recommend purchase of the View until the software problems have been fixed.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "A content consumption device keeping you from your content.", "body": "***UPDATE****After a few more weeks with this, all I can say is the experience gets worse and worse.Google has a great navigation app built in. But it can't get you home because it doesn't download the directions for both ways. You put in your destination (type it, becuase Google can't understand that \"Two-twenty main street\" is \"220 Main Street\" instead of \"2 20 Main Street\"), and you can take the device into the car and it works great getting you to where you are going. But if you want to retrace your path home, you cannot do so because you very likely do not have a Wifi connection at your destination. Instead it tells you it is waiting for directions to download. Would it be so hard to anticipate that most folks go back an forth and preload this?I loaded Flash following the directions from one of the helpful people who commented to this review. It works OK with Firefox (although I'm not a firefox fan). Downside is that Hulu still knows you are on a tablet and won't let you access video. Amazon streaming works, but since you cannot turn of one-click purchases, it is very easy to buy the entire season of a show you are watching. I did so simply by dropping the tablet on my lap. After calling, Amazon refunded the money, but made it sound like they were reluctant to do so. They confirmed there is no way to turn it off. With the exception of YouTube, most video watching is a far inferior experience with this thing, which is a shame as tablets are supposed to be \"content consumption devices.\"Is there a decent Podcast app anywhere? Google removed \"listen\" from it standard apps and now you have to look through the morass of options, none of which seem all that good. Google play doesn't have a podcast store so I can't find an easy way to find what I'm looking for. I tried some of the more highly rated apps but they don't have a good search mechanism and seemed fairly primative. Podcasts should be as native as music and video.If I get new music, it doesn't sync with this device. It can sync with the cloud (through Google Play) so I can hear it at home or work, but if I'm traveling, I can't listen to my music (no wifi) unless I connect it via USB cable (bluetooth doesn't appear to give you access to folders) and move it using the file manager. It doesn't even have sync when connected via USB; just drag and drop.Even the apps one pays for are always asking you to buy something. It's this strange game on a meta level where you always have to be thinking before you pick up the device \"Am I going to touch the screen in such a way that I inadvertantly buy something from the current app or from Amazon?\".This last point I'll concede is a bit silly, but when I close an app, I want it closed. But apps don't close, they get added to the list and stay open so you get a big long list of things that were recently opened. This might be useful if it wasn't so long. Like with any windowing environment, it is nice to have some open and some closed so you can pick among the ones you intentionally left open. But if you have to leave them all open, then it's just a big mess. It's like you aren't allowed to say I'm done with this, go away (you can go to the list, hold your finger down, and close it that way, but that is just plain silly).In every form of content I want to consume, this device looks to get in the way. The only way it doesn't is if you are fully into Google exclusively (It says on the box \"Made for Google Play\") and have a mobile hotspot to access your content (and a big data plan!).*************I'll be honest and say I gave the average star rating for this project because my dislike of this isn't so much that it is a bad tablet, but that I can't figure out why anyone would want such a device, be it this one or a competitor. I've had this for several weeks and am just continually frustrated by it. Here is why:Web Surfing: No flash, so one is constantly running into sites where you can't play content. Flash is simply not supported and never will be. This will be fine in a few year when the web has transfered over, but it is a pain in the *** now. There is a way to \"side load it\", but the directions I've seen say something about getting the \"APK\" from an existing android device and using Firefox and some other complicated stuff. I suppose if you know what you are doing it takes just 20 minutes (as some claim), but I've spent far more than that just trying to figure out what to do. They made it harder after August when they removed an app from the store that helped. So you can get the Hulu app and pay for Hulu+ and watch videos on the 7\" screen. That's fine, but $8 for Hulu + $8 for netflix + $8 for spotify adds up after a while. You can get by with YouTube through Google's app, but it is organized around Channels and not a great experience. Perhaps my laptop has spoiled me but I am used to having a wider selection of options that are ad supported and even being able to download youtube videos for the kids to watch in the car on a long trip.Videos: With 8 GB you aren't going to have much local content. See the issues with streaming under web surfing. There is a video option under \"Google Play\" where you buy them from Google. However I can't see a way to download locally so I can watch these movies on the road nor is it easy to watch these movies on my TV. There is no HDMI out, so there are few options to watch my purchased movies. I believe I can watch it from my laptop or other PC (which can be hooked up to my TV), but if I'm doing that, I'd rather have purchased it from somewhere else more cheaply, like Amazon streaming. I did borrow a friend's Nexus Q, and that is a cool device that allows you to watch on your TV without a computer, but that is just limited to Google Play and YouTube. It is very frustrating to try to use services you like on this device. I've yet to explore all the options; I presume Amazon has an app for android. ... and am I supposed to hold this thing for two hours? I guess there is a case somewhere that makes this viable, but still it is a small screen so it has to be pretty near your head to watch; not a great experience.Music: With 8 GB of storage (about 5 or so actually available) locally stored music isn't a decent option if you are storing other things on the device as well, so it relies heavily on streaming. Since this doesn't have a cell phone connection (nor would I want to pay the outragous fees for one), music streaming is only an option where there is a wireless connection, so listening to music is only viable at home, work, or in a cafe. It doesn't work in a car or airplane. And the options for streaming are limited. I love to run spotify on my laptop, which is free if you can tolerate the ads. But you need an app to run spotify on the tablet and the app is far more limited than the PC version in that you have to listen to their \"radio\" (songs they choose) instead of getting to choose the songs you want. Google Play is decent if you don't mind uploading your entire music collection to the web (took me over a week for 3,000+ songs), but the interface is a bit crude (can't easily find a song without searching). It is also very focused on selling you new stuff, so one is constantly swiping away recommendations and offers to get what you want. Why bother when I can store this on a dedicated MP3 player?Email: It is nice to be able to check email easily. But, of course, I have to be near a wireless connection to do so and most of the time I'm around wireless I could just as easily use my PC. My laptop weighs about 3 pounds and has a 13\" screen and keyboard. Granted it cost 3x the price of this tablet, but at least I can write a decent response, open attachments, and use the tools I want. Typing on a virtual keyboard is OK for a sentence or two, but not for anything substantial.Apps: I'll admit, the kids love all the games. For an adult, they are often of limited value as you can't really do all that much with a touch interface. I guess I have to stop being so cheap and start paying more than a buck or two for games to see if there are ones that aren't boring after the first few minutes. The free apps are fun for a few minutes, but soon into them there are all these offers to buy things. I can ignore and dismiss them, but I worry that my youngsters will not know what's going on and spend $15 for a different color virtual BMX bike. I wish I could turn off the purchasing ability of this thing. I don't have a credit card attached but I did add some credit to my Google account that I don't know how to turn off.I wish I could take pictures or video, but no rear facing camera or standard picture app for the front cameral. The device is portable (it does fit in my front pocket!) but being tied to wireless and having few non-connected uses makes its portability less useful.Android gets a lot of plusses for being \"open\", but if this is open I'd hate to see what isn't. Things that laptop users take for granted (e.g. standard hulu, variety of browsers, plugins, programs, office tools, VPN, ...) are much more limited. You often have to pay for the same services that are otherwise free and, given Google and Adobe don't give you flash, you are mostly out of luck if you want flash. So much of the standard items are focused on Google services which you either buy (Play music, movies, many apps) or join the data harvesting machine (Gmail, Google+). I could see that if you bought into the Google ecosystem manyof my issues would not be that great, but that is sort of the opposite of open. It is very \"Googly\".I hope this doesn't rile too many folks. I don't own a single Apple product, so this isn't an android/ios thing. It is more a warning that you should be sure you want a tablet and are aware of its limitations before getting one. For some a better option is an always-connected smartphone or tablet, others a laptop, and others may love the Nexus 7. It just isn't working for me.", "rating": "neg"}

The single cores were horrible in there inception in about 2005 or so, and critics even claimed this was the beginning of the end for AMD.

Well with all the new I series out now AMD can barely hold its head above water and most places that sell them are wal-mart and staples, for much cheaper. Even Celerons beat the Dual Core Turions is benchmark tests or are not far behind. I have this computer and it was just horrible, the processor couldnt even handle Vista, and even today with 7 i've seen several people say omg this is soooo slow. I have a new HP Dv7 with all the bells and whistles and the worst part about it, yep you guessed it, the AMD Phenom Triple core at 2.1ghz. Thats a total of about 6.3 ghz total processing power, which is barely above my emachines pentium dual core 2.27. Actually the emachines does everything quicker, but can't play games, thats it.

The unit does not come with instructions but since I  used other systems before it was not hard to figure out...I should add that 3 weeks after I received the unit I got an email with link to some online instructions for it...better late than never I guess. The lights are okay, but not with the umbrellas that come with the set.  I purchased some reflective ones to replace the white ones that come with the set to make the light more useable. The light stands themselves are just okay not great but will do the job.  The muslin backdrops are so-so like many have stated they wrinkle easily and must be steamed before each use unless of course you want a wrinkled background look. The only way to avoid this is to find a way to roll them up for storage...not really convenient though.  Would I do again ...no probably not, at best it is just a fair setup.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Limited range. Loses Wi-Fi connection.", "body": "The best feature of this camera is the ease of setup, taking less than 5 minutes. There are no port forwarding or other router settings to configure as required with the Foscam and DLink camera. After a major power loss this unit automatically reconnects and even sends an email stating the time and duration of the disconnect. That is assuming the camera is fairly close to the router.However after connecting I found that it has a limited Wi-Fi range, the poorest of any device tested.  All other devices including Foscam and Dlink cameras, an iPad, and several laptop computers all connect at least double the distance. Meanwhile the Drop Cam disconnects at less than 20 feet from the router, regardless of placement, and often as low as 15 feet even though my Wi-Fi Signal Analyzer measures between 4 and 5 bars (max signal).  This is most likely due to the design of the Drop Cam Wi-Fi client which has been squeezed into the small camera housing and is lacking any decent antennas. There is no way to increase the Wi-Fi range of this camera. My router is an ASUS RT-AC66u which reliably connects all Wi-Fi devices throughout the entire house and even outside, everything except the Drop Cam. Do not buy this Cam if you plan to install it at any decent distance from the router. Also unlike the Foscam you cannot use a direct LAN connection for this camera. It is either Wi-Fi or nothing and that is often the case - nothing.Be advised that you must pay $99 a year to access the 7 day recording feature and that will only work if the camera does not loose its Wi-Fi connection.

{"title": "Tinny sound", "body": "I got this at Costco for eighty dollars.  At that price, you get a 6 watt speaker that floats and is water resistant.  It's plenty loud, though that sound is NOT of good quality.  There's no real bass to speak of, which can be expected from a speaker of this size, but the mix is way too out of balance in favor of the highs.  What you end up getting is just an unpleasant listening experience.The speakerphone works really well.  The battery life seems ok as well.  One other gripe I have is that when you first switch the device on, it pairs with your phone (or mp3 player, or whatever) and it plays the last song you were playing, even if you weren't playing a song at all.  Also, the transport/volume buttons are the same.  To raise or lower the volume, you have to hold the button in the direction you want to go.  If you want to skip tracks forward or backward, you just tap the button.  This is backwards to other bluetooth speakers I've used and I can see why other companies have it the other way; holding for track management is much more intuitive.As far as bluetooth speakers that actually sound good, I've actually chosen the Braven BRV-1.  Even though this speaker is much louder, what good is that volume if I can't enjoy my music?  The braven is loud enough and my boy and I listen for hours.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Apple Lost a Loyal Customer.", "body": "I had the venerable (and superior) 5.5 \"Video\". It was the device that introduced me to mobile music, and we shared 2 very meaningful years together. When the time came to upgrade, primarily for storage reasons, I gravitated towards the iPod Classic as a result of my great experience with the Video. But I also looked around at competing players and weighed their merits. What finally cinched it was the vast array of accessories available for the iPod. Like that, I remained in the Apple fold.This device is at best a mediocre media player. At worst, it is Apple's clear intent to say, \"Screw you\" to it's customers. Read on for an explanation of the latter.I have similar complaints as most. Coverflow is a gimmick, useful about as long as it takes for your eyes to widen and your lips to form an \"O\" shape. Then it is readily apparent that the Classic..a unit ostensibly designed to hold a gazillion albums, is too severely underpowered to keep up with its OWN SELLING POINT. Yes, I did update the firmware. Still, this didn't bother me too terribly much, as I prefer the classic menus - and then I found that they too are hobbled. For instance, when I select on artist in the text-only mode, all four or five albums of said artist will load in the screen far ahead of their accompanying album art...and user input isn't recognized until all of the art loads. This results in a fairly significant lag from when the titles appear on the screen and when I can actually select the album for playback. It's irritating as all hell, particularly if you're trying to hear, say, track 5 but must wait for the Classic to cycle through it's own features before you can so much as select from a list. Disabling ALL album art in iTunes (another piece of crap) solves all of these problems. Yet the question remains - why load your player with features that it will choke on? It was just as dumb when they sold 'Vista-capable' computers with 512MB of RAM. Now, perhaps this isn't an issue when there aren't 1000 albums loaded on the device...but isn't this why Apple markets it as, \"Decisions, who needs 'em?\" You're SUPPOSED to have that much music on a 80GB player.Audio quality is fine. Nothing stellar, but not so far removed from it's direct competitors that I'd recommend another player for that reason alone. However, I TOTALLY suggest a new set of 'phones. The bundled ones are, as you may have heard, complete crap. They may sound fair if they are what you're accustomed to, but a '78 Corvette might feel fast until you drive a Ferrari. Just sayin'.Now for the severe gripes. My drive started audibly clicking while incidentally two weeks out of warranty (am not angry with the warranty period; it's a fact of life). If your drive clicks very, very quietly, like you can only hear it while pressing your ear to the chrome...that's perfectly normal. However, mine was audible from three or four feet from my ears, and I could feel it grinding in my hand. This is a sign of impending drive failure, and my solution was to throw a replacement iPod-compatible drive that I happened to have lying around, because I'm a geek  like that. Well, iPods before the Classic are designed to easily be taken apart (they're simply well-adhesed) using controlled force and a tiny screwdriver, guitar pick, etc. What did I find out about the Classic? IT'S BEEN DESIGNED TO BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE APART. The Classic will be hopelessly DAMAGED if you take it apart, due to the clips now integrated to the casing where there were none before. There is only ONE reason for Apple to have added this design. The message: Dear consumer: We see you tried to fix your iPod yourself, and thus trying to avoid buying a new one! Hahahahaha!!! You lose! Buy new!Words cannot describe the anger I felt when I discovered this. It is the ULTIMATE slap in the face, and proof of my earlier suspicions that Apple is irritating company that thrives on zombie hipsters lauding their products while droning away in a rigidly controlled ecosystem of hard and software. I now despise this company so much that my anger has effected the quality of this review. But here it is, anyway.Also, the decision-swaying fact that there are tons of iPod-specific accessories available? That's true. But it's a silly reason to purchase a media player, particularly when the player itself is so woefully underpowered. I for one was very happy after divorcing myself of all things Apple.The Classic is the worst iPod ever made. And that's too bad, because the Video was one of the great loves of my tech life. I mourned it's loss. The Classic? Ugh.", "rating": "neg"}
{"title": "Disappointed...", "body": "So I'd like to preface this with saying that I'm not a technical novice.  I've been working in IT for 10 years and am pretty well versed in hardware and A/V equipment in general.I was really disappointed in this device (but I got it for free with my laptop, so I'd be even more negative if I'd paid for this).  The biggest problem I had with this is that Intel put the wireless display adapter along side their wifi adapter inside my laptop, so connectivity to the display gets a little strange when I'm hooked up to my wifi connection on my laptop.  It took me forever to get the driver set right for Windows 7 (on my Asus Bamboo U43J -- which I'm VERY happy with) and even then, I had continual problems getting this device to work properly from my laptop when connecting to my Netgear Wireless N wireless router.  I suspect that there are a few issues with it still and even when I was playing with it, there was a firmware upgrade to this device that made performance better, but there's a good bit of lag when running this at resolution.  Watching TV is nearly impossible, but it would work for presentations--as long as you're good with a possibility of choppy transitions and possible drops in connectivity.This technology seems like it could be interesting, but it's definitely not ready for prime time.  Maybe in the next few years Intel will split the hardware so that this process doesn't interfere with wireless internet connectivity.For the geeks out there--it's definitely cool and if you want to try it out, there used to be a way to get this for free if you were buying specific laptops--if you're in the market for a new laptop and want to get one of these, it might be worth your while to check out the computers that offer this for free along with it on Amazon.

{"title": "Picture is Way Too Dark", "body": "I purchased the 60\" version from Walmart on 1/29/2012 for $898.00 I figured that was an outstanding deal for a 60\" plasma, and Panasonic is known for their awesome picture quality. Right away I noticed the same exact thing another poster mentioned in his assessment of the 42\" version he purchased. The picture is way too dark. My family room is very dimly lit in the first place, but even the dimmer room doesn't make up for how dark the picture is on the TV. If you've ever owned one of the old picture tube TVs and had the TV long enough for the tube to start going out, it would gradually become darker and darker until it was time to buy a new TV. That's what this TV looks like right out of the box, and that's after cranking the contrast and brightness all the way to 100, the highest it will go. I've tried it in VIVID and GAME mode, the two brightest modes, and still only a slight improvement. This isn't my first rodeo. I've owned other plasma TVs and a few LCD TVs as well, so I'm pretty well versed in how to adjust for a good picture. I called Panasonic, and after an hour and 15 minutes on the phone with them having me tweaking settings, and making it worse than what I had accomplished on my own, they are sending out a tech to take a look at the set. In the mean time, I'm shopping around for a comparable deal and will likely return this set and purchase something else. It's tough to go down in size though once you've had a 60\" tv in your room. You get spoiled on the big picture. On a side note, I also had a problem with the Digital Optical Audio Out port; the only audio out port on the entire TV. I tried plugging in a Digital Audio Toslink cable, but it wouldn't click in and stay. No matter how much I tried, there was never a click that held it in place, so once you let go, just the slightest movement and the thing just fall out of the port. I even tried the cable on other devices, just to make sure it wasn't a faulty cable, and it clicked in and stayed with no problem. I asked Panasonic to have their tech take a look at it because it seems like a faulty port, and they told me, if it's a damaged or faulty port that has some physical deformity, Panasonic will not cover it, I should just return the TV to Walmart. I asked why it wouldn't be covered since Panasonic must have installed a faulty port and again was told, we won't cover that, just return the TV to where you purchased it. The problem is, for $898.00, Walmart sold out of them in the first hour and won't be getting any more. In the end, I'm not too happy with this TV and will likely be returning it as soon as I find a replacement suitable replacement. Has anyone else noticed this problem, or are there just a few bad sets with dark pictures in this S30 line?UPDATE 2/15/2012Now that I've owned this TV for a couple of weeks, I can confidently say, this TV falls short. It's not the worst, and for the money I paid, many might consider it a great deal, but it lacks in picture quality. It's still way too dark, even for a very dimly lit room like mine. Even the whites look like light grays. Things in the shadows of the picture completely disappear. I can take the same Bluray video and put it in the same player hooked to one of my cheap off brand 40\" LCD TVs and the picture looks great, even in the shadow details. Panasonic sent a tech to my home to change out one of the processor boards, and it didn't change things at all. The tech told me that's Panasonic's approach to getting deep rich blacks. Yes, the blacks are awesome; but really, how black does black need to be? In my opinion, once you get the blacks to look black, that should be enough. Some of the companies seem to get so hung up on the numbers though, which in Panasonic's case, or at least in this TV model, they went way too far. The darkness overtakes the total picture, and really diminishes the experience of owning a big screen TV. Aside from the dark picture, the overall quality really isn't all that great either. I put in a blueray disk, and the details just aren't there, like on my other TVs. At best, the picture quality is below average, and if that were the only issue, I'd say I got an awesome deal for $898.00 brand new. With the overall picture quality and darkness though, I'm likely going to return the set and look for something else.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "I Wanted to Like It, But Didn't", "body": "My thoughts as I prepare to write this review are that I'm a Microsoft basher...I feel I keep thinking of more and more bad to say about this mouse than good, yet you could hardly pay be to use anything but a Microsoft Natural Keyboard, and for a no-frills mouse, the original wires MS Optical Mouse was great.  But, I've moved on to favoring ergonomically sculpted, wireless, optical mice and when my Logitech MX1000's SetPoint software failed to work under Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit, in spite of using the version released for that O/S, I found myself looking for an alternative mouse, and bought the MS Laser 6000 v2.It's going back into the box to be returned.  Why?  Well, first the good which is also the bad, and hence really a personal preference:  The mouse is supremely comfortable.  Your hand (right-handers) just naturally drapes over the mouse and falls into place without having to grip inwards; lift your hand and the mouse simply stays in place.  So, if you like to just palm your mouse and rarely lift it to reposition it, you'll be fine.  It glides with ease, very smoothly on a mousepad.But, if you favor a slight grip on a mouse and occasionally lift it to reposition it, this is not the mouse for you, and I'm in this category.  The mouse is a bit heavy toward the tail end where the bulk of the battery weight is.  If you attempt to lift the mouse, the contours are such that gripping it is tricky, as there are few surfaces or lips under which your fingers are nestled, to lift upwards against.  And being tail-heavy, that lighter front end is thus just happy to slip from your hand as the tail weight drags it out of the hand as it is lifted.  So, this was more of a drawback than I realized for my style of use.The middle wheel, slimmer and smooth in contrast to many other MS mice with their ribbed, rubber wheels, is also a problem.  Perhaps because there is a smaller contact area, a distinct force is required to press the wheel for a middle-click operation.  I believe  I also favor a wheel with soft detents rather than the smooth scrolling feel, but that is easily just a personal choice.Although wireless, the mouse requires the user to swap out the batteries, which I think is just silly when a well-designed rechargeable docking station offers the convenience of always having a charged mouse ready to use.  That said, the usefulness of at least having removable batteries is good to see, yet they can still be rechargealbe AAs.  I really like the nested USB design for the wirelesss transmitter; when travelling with the mouse, the USB receiver is pressed into a cutout on the mouse base, which also turns off power, preserving the battery life.In the end, this is possibly a very nice mouse for those who palm a mouse, and a terrible mouse if you prefer to slightly grip it during use.", "rating": "neg"}

When it is working, it is great - it has detected every vehicle traversing my driveway, very good range, no false alerts caused by animals (nearby lightening strikes will sometimes trip the alert but I don't know if that is the transmitter or the receiver).  However, I had to return the transmitter to Dakota Alert several times during the first few months of use (and thankfully their customer service department is great to work with).  Short version - over time, one or more of the batteries shipped with the transmitter would reverse polarity and the unit would stop working.  I finally replaced all the batteries with Duracell batteries and the unit worked fine after that.But there are two other shortcomings with the unit:1. the lithium batteries (it uses four CR123) are expensive and battery life is dismal.  The literature says the batteries should last on average six months.  I have never gotten more than four months and cold weather shortens the life even more.2. the battery compartment is very poorly constructed. The batteries do not snap securely in the holder and once when the unit stopped working, I found one of the batteries had fallen out of the holder.  Another time when changing the batteries, a plastic tab holding a spring clip on the end of one of the batteries broke off and the clip fell out.  I was able to fashion a coil spring from a piece of stainless wire and get that to stay in place but now I have to be very careful when I replace the battery.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Underpowered, no improvement over TV speakers", "body": "I purchased this sound bar on an impulse, after quickly checking the amazon review score. Unfortunately, this time the score led me astray.The main problem with this bar is that its volume is very low. I hooked it up to two TVs and I compared the speakers with the bar by switching between them: in both cases, the speakers offered more power (on medium volume setting) that I could only match with the bar by raising its volume close to the maximum. Fortunately, the older (6+ years) TV had a mode for connecting external speakers that allows the TV to control the volume of the signal, so by boosting the volume from the TV, I can actually get a decent enough volume from the bar that I can further adjust using its remote. However, more recent TVs don't have this facility, so this bar would not work too well with them. The fact that the bar doesn't memorize the set volume composes this problem, because it will force you to always adjust it back up on restart.With its volume up, the bar manages to provide just one clear advantage: it renders bass better than the TV speakers. That isn't as noticeable as one may expect though - it requires some really low frequency sounds to be apparent. I used a THX test to confirm that the bar's range extended into lower frequencies than the TV speakers but the only place where this was clearly apparent in practice was in a video game that had a really low frequency background music that tended to get my TV speakers to vibrate - that issue got solved with this bar (but I still got the bar speakers to vibrate in a movie).Another disadvantage is that there does not seem to be a way to program the bar to work with the TV remote and the bar remote only has enough functions to control the bar - this means you have one more remote to fumble with.Oh, and one more important thing - this product does not come with any cable to allow you to hook it up to a device! You have to purchase a cable separately. No audio/digital optical cable is included. I guess that's one of the ways to lower the price.Some technical details: The bar has three main controls: Volume: 1-63, Bass: 1-10, Treble: 1-10. On power on, it always resets the volume to 33, but it memorizes the bass and treble settings, so you do not need to readjust those. There is no digital display for these settings, but the bar lights flicker to indicate when they successfully receive a command and they all light up when you reach min/max settings.In conclusion, this may be the state of the art in a ~$100 sound bar, but it falls short of impressing and proving its value, because it has a hard time showing a benefit over TV speakers. I would suggest saving the money for a better sound upgrade like I found in theSamsung HW-FM45C 280W Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer and HDMI Cable.[UPDATE] Writing this review spurred me to make another comparison which made me decide to return this product. It is not worth the space it is taking. I used a music DVD for the comparison this time and the vocals could not be heard as clearly as on the TV speakers - it feels as if the midrange is severely lacking. So, while it might provide some advantage at low frequencies, it takes away more than it adds.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "SanDisk, the failed frontier", "body": "Several years ago, I reviewed the SanDisk SDCFH-1024-901 1 GB Ultra II CF card and noted as a company SanDisk used to produce products that were top quality, blazing fast, and backed them up with unparalleled customer service and as such their cards were well worth the SanDisk name tax.  At the time of the 1 GB Ultra card, I also noted that no longer seemed to be the case, as of the three cards I had, all three of them failed within a short period of time.It's been years since I've bought a SanDisk card and have instead been using Lexmar cards with my Canon 10D and have never suffered a failure or loss of data.For Christmas I received a Canon 7D and figured in light of all the positive reviews and the many recommendations that recieved, I decided to give SanDisk a try again.  After all its been a while, and admittedly, at the time I purchased the 1 GB cards they were the latest and greatest things on the market and I'm sure SanDisk had worked out any bugs in manufacturing, process and quality control, and customer service.I couldn't have been more wrong.A day and a half, 500 pictures later and the card failed.Granted, it only cost me one picture (a massively under-exposed shot taken in the rain) but now the card won't format (errors out in camera as card being unusable and gives the following error under Windows 7 \"7830794 bad sectors were encountered during the format. Invalid media or Track 0 bad - disk unusable.\"The only thing more irritating than that was SanDisk's response to my customer service request.  It basically consisted of \"Oh, your card failed?  Too bad.  If it's under 30 days, please return it to the place of purchase.  If it's not, then we'll see about placing a hold on your credit card and sending you a new one while you send us the failed one back.  If we determine that the card failed due to something you did wrong or you fail to return the failed card then we'll charge your credit card for the MSRP + shipping + tax (if applicable)\".Compare that with my Lexar 4 GB Platinum II, which I've had for what feels like doggies years, and has not failed, and has lasted 750 pictures, five HD movies, and two days with my 7D.  I fully expect that trend to continue and for this card to finish out the trip and provide me additional years of faithful service.

Yes, they are $140 (sometimes as low as $100 though if you're patient) vs. $85, but the sound quality difference is substantial.I have both in my house and have used both with the exact same amp and pre-amp, so my recommendation is based on personal experience and a very direct comparison.Luckily, the ceiling hole size is just about the same, so these are getting returned and I'll be buying a 2nd pair of RC801's instead.UPDATE: My overall review is not changing, but I was so confused about why others were so happy with these speakers when they were so weak in my opinion, when it occurred to me that most of the other reviewers were using them for an A/V surround sound setup.  Because in that environment you get most of the lows from the subwoofer and the fronts whereas the sides/rears are used for the more directionally noticeable mids and highs, I could see how they would be better suited for a surround sound setup.  Their mids and highs are very good, perhaps a tiny bit better than the RC80i's.  So, if you're using them for a 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound setup and you're being cost conscious, these wouldn't be a horrible choice.But they're still not as good overall as the RC80i's nor any better than a 2-star set of speakers when rated based on their overall performance.", "rating": "neg"}

Serves me right for not doing proper research on this TV, and not buying through Amazon.EDIT 3/19/14: Even though this tv gets very little use, it manage to die on me for no apparent reason!

{"title": "Too expensive for a no frills GPS unit", "body": "I have a TomTom XL GPS in one car and this Magellan in my other car. While the TomTom has more extras, the Magellan has no frills at all. Yet the TomTom XL costs less.The only point it has over the TomTom is that it boots up a little faster.It offers no choice of voices while the TomTom offers at least 84 voices for free or purchase.The screen is much easier to see than the Magellan and offers a wide choice of colors. I use 6 color schemes because some are much more visible to view in darkness while others are better for viewing in daylight. There are currently at least 219 free color schemes available (44 designed for night driving, 36 for color blind people). Those who complain that all GPS screens are hard to read in daylight are wrong. The one I chose to use on my TomTom is easily readable day or night. The night view I am using is a night scene so the screen isn't real bright so it doesn't distract me from what I see out the windshield and the daytime colors have enough contrast to offset the glare from the sun.The Magellan offers no selection of vehicles for the display while I have 19 different vehicles loaded on my TomTom and there about 600 different cars/trucks cars available in a variety of colors.The Magellan doesn't show speed, ETA or any of the other things you would expect of a GPS. My other GPS shows speed and ETA if traveling at the current vehicle speed. It also indicates when I am speeding at more than 5 MPH above the speed for that location. It also warns me if I am in a school zone, a church zone, an intersection with a \"safety camera\", etc. These warnings can be visual or both visual and auditory. These warnings can obviously prevent you from receiving a traffic ticket. So one warning can pay for the price of the GPS unit just on ticket fines alone, not to say that it will possibly keep my car insurance rates from going up from receiving a traffic citation.It would be fine to offer a GPS with only the bare necessities if you saved a substantial amount in purchasing it. But this unit isn't less expensive than units with far more capabilities than it has.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "For want of a nail...", "body": "I'll admit to spending more than I should for technical geegaws.  Upon discovering that my current trackball was beginning to suffer from terminal stickykey-itis I decided to go shopping for a new one.  Having just spend a fortune upgrading my hardware I decided that the 29.95 trackball that has served be loyally for nearly a decade was too low class and found the Kensington Slimblade with it's sleek, shiny black skin, soft curve and insanely high price just the toy to build my ego.So I took one home, only to discover that my ego is a very poor judge of functionality.  In fact, I am never going to trust me again.  Beneath the pretty face on this accessory lurks the brain of an idiot.First of all, using the Slimblade is a whole lesson in bad ergonomics.  Keep in mind that I'm used to this kind of device.  The size and height of the ball make for difficulty in finding a relaxed position for your wrist.  So add a wrist rest to the cost of the Slimblade.  It's a four button mouse, and the pressure points are so placed that it's fairly easy to hit the wrong button.  And, finally, the slimline uses slots cut in the case to allow portions of the top to flex for use as buttons.  These slots are as likely to admit dirt as anything else, and there is no way to open the case for cleaning.  Given a user with a penchant for finger food and sooner or later you will be throwing out a very expensive, glued up brick.OK, on to functionality.  The Slimblade comes out of the box with the buttons defined as left and right click.  Button three switches to media mode which turns the Slimblade into an implementation of standard media interfaces.  Since most software media players have some sort of on-screen controls this isn't as useful as it sounds - it's clumsy and the lack of any indicators means that you will spend some time looking up how to do things.  I should also point out that I usually don't listen to music or watch videos with my hand on the trackball.  The fourth button provides a View mode (zooms and pans) which is mode notable for telling you what it can't zoom or pan on.Now comes the truely inglorious part.  You have just spent over $100 for a trackball that comes out of the box with four preset functions.  And that's all you get.  The software controls are basically just your basic OS mouse controls and you can't reprogram the buttons to do anything useful.  Despite this being the highest priced trackball there is, it is no more useful to a professional than a two-button mouse.  Don't make my mistake, there are countless better (and cheaper) options.

The radio alarm will turn on at the last volume used - NOT a good thing!2. Remote control - Similar to other reviews, the remote control has to be pointed at some exact specific angle for the radio to respond. I have to click the volume up or down several times to get it to do anything unless I drop everything and concentrate on aiming the remote.3. User Interface (UI) - The menu is also oddly organized and lacks some basic thought around the UI, especially the buttons - one is labeled \"NPR\" another, \"My NPR,\" and another \"Favorites.\"  My NPR and Favorites do the same exact thing, unless I am missing something.  NPR just takes you to the main menu (just like pushing the volume knob) and should be titled \"Menu.\"  The buttons need relabeling very badly and without duplicate functions that are illogical. And accessing Pandora requires too many button clicks - it could be on the main menu instead of a submenu.4. Network Bug - If you accidentally unplug (or the power goes out) the radio while it is streaming and you you hide your SSID (as everyone should do for security), you will have to manually enter the network name into the radio again. Even though it saves your WPA2 key to the network, it does NOT save the network name (or cannot access it) when this situation occurs. Unfortunate, inconvenient, and annoying programming bug that should not be in a product that has been on the market as long as this radio.5. Speaker -  This radio's speaker does NOT have the proper shielding to stop cell phone interference. At this price point, that is very disappointing. If you have a cell phone that makes those odd sounds in radios, this one will do it too. :(6. Day Light Saving Time - this is the only internet connected device that I own that does not update the time when time changes twice a year. That is very unusual to not have the radio query a time server to update automatically.7. Anytime I reset my Apple Airport Router (which has to be done regularly since it is junk - if Apple doesn't make millions on something, they put few resources into its development), I have to unplug my radios to reset them as well about 50% of the time.8. Weak WIFI antenna. Like others, connection to your router can be spotty. My router is on my second floor, 1 radio on the first floor has trouble due to a weak internal WIFI antenna. My computers on the 1st floor have no problems, just the radio.I have no problems with Reciva, as others have mentioned. I have been able to trace all bugs to the mediocre design of the radio's firmware, horrible remote control, weak WIFI antenna, and unshielded speaker.**As for the bugs mentioned - I have two of these radios and verified bugs on both radios.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Buttons too Similar", "body": "I purchased the Logitech Harmony 880 from my local Costco Warehouse it was an impulse buy. I don't normally do that for this type of equipment, but it was nicely priced at $97.99 and with an LCD screen it was too good to pass up. We needed a new remote because the screen on our Logitech Harmony 670 was going away due to too many drops on the floor, although it still worked flawlessly.I returned the 880 after using it seven days because the buttons are too similar, and the critical ones are too small to keep your fingers on. The buttons that control play, fast forward and rewind are too low on the remote to hold my thumb on them, such as when I wanted to fast forward through commercials, I would have to glance down to make sure I pushed the right ones. That didn't happen with my 670 as the buttons were smartly placed and spaced and they had a different `feel' so I could control my devices without diverting my eyes.I really didn't want a remote with a charging base because of reviews from others that had a dead remote because they left it off the charger. But, I have to say our 880 stayed on the base when not in use even though I have a wife and two teenagers (I did give them an ultimatum when we purchased that \"it better be returned to the base, or else!\").The remote did have a nice feel to it and the weight was just right, but the button layout was not ergonomic.

{"title": "Revised review. Disaster. All sizzle, no steak.", "body": "Here is my original review. See below for my experience one week later.There is so much hype around this box it's just amazing. Bottom line:* The \"Easy Setup\" is pure garbage. Took me 12 hours plus, and I'm a computer/electrical engineer.* Connectivity issues abound. Don't get more than a few feet from your wireless router.* Once working, navigation is terrible. Search by Title is the only option for Netflix.* The actual streaming video is mostly OK. Quality is good, but:* Forget about HD.The setup issue: I spent probably eight hours getting the box to connect to my wireless-n router that's connected to a cable modem for internet. It would not connect. Returned one to the store for another. Finally got it to connect, but only after extremely careful placement of the Roku box. If you think you're going to put it on top of anything else, or near anything else, forget it. It has to be far away from other electrical equipment or metal objects. The Roku box in the living room is only about 35 feet from the wireless router in the office. I figure that's kinda normal. But the Roku tech support guy said that's too far. So, I updated the firmware on the router to a hacked version that will put a bit more power to the transmitter and found the best frequency for router transmission. Now it works. But, don't get the idea you're going to do this in 5 minutes (if ever, for many people...).Then it took another two hours to figure how to connect my wife's Netflix account to my Roku account. Got it done, eventually. Not well documented.The connectivity issue: Wireless is marginal at any reasonable distance from the wireless router; in my case about 35 feet. I had to relocate the Roku box away from the rest of the home AV system. Not far, but enough that it's not now in the direct beam of the Harmony remote that controls everything else. A pain. The best solution is to hard wire the Roku box via cat-100 or cat-1000 from the router to the Roku box which obviates the wireless distance problem. But that isn't possible for me; I need to use wireless from the home office and that's why I bought the Roku box. In the process I had to use some special software to scan the wifi available spectrum to find a channel that wouldn't get interference from neighbors (who are all using their internet, too ...). Then find hacked router firmware to allow me to increase the transmitter power from router. What a mess.Navigation: We have only Netflix, so others may vary. The only way to navigate is to search by movie title, or to pick from a list of Netflix offerings guessed from previous searches. No search by genre; by actor; by director; by year; nothing. Just title. Archaic.Picture quality & HD: Once everything is working the picture quality is fairly good. I'm using HDMI out to a 1080p monitor, but that's overkill given that there's essentially zero content that actually demands it. All of the available content is 480i. My HD monitor scales it up to 1080 and it looks OK, but it's still a 480i signal and you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Forward to the past.That said, and a day and half of frustration later, my wife is on the couch in the living room watching a streaming video from Netflix. If not for that this product would have had a one or two star rating from me, not three.One week later:It's going back.This thing will not maintain any solid connection to my wireless router. I've spent many hours messing with it. I'm done. To heck with it. My wife has given up even trying.It will connect to my TV through the HDMI connector about one time in six. I can get video through the composite output, but HD through HDMI is totally unreliable.It takes about 5 minutes to boot, then can't ever remember my network settings.Lots of promise to the technology, but this box doesn't deliver.", "rating": "neg"}
{"title": "Poor attempt at a touchpad", "body": "I am a long time PC user, but occasionally I'm jealous of my Mac friends. This was the first desktop version of a trackpad released by a major manufacturer, and I was excited to pre-order one from Logitech, even if they were over a year behind Apple's magic trackpad. I must say that I was dissapointed. Multi touch track pads have been used in laptops for some time now, and I figured Logitech would have refined these technologies to come out with a product to rival it's Mac equivilent. They definitely missed the mark on this one.Pro's: It's a touchpad for your desktop. The cordless feature and auto power-on is a nice feature and having the two mouse buttons is a plus over the magic trackpad. I also like the four finger sweep to replace a traditional back button on a mouse.Cons: it's plastic, which can make for slow movement, and I have not found a way to increase/decrease sensitivity or track speed. The actual functional surface is small, inset about 1/2 inch inside the edge of the track pad. This is very frustrating. I am continually looking down or having to palm the edges of the trackpad to re-center my fingers. The multitouch is sketchy. I may just be used to touch phones, but I would like to be able to use two fingers to stretch a window or zoom in and out.  Also, clicking and dragging is a pain as you have to tap and tap/hold and hope that it didn't register as a double click. You can also tap and click the bottom button, but that's also awkward.Overall, this would have been a nice product a few years ago, but I feel like it was poorly executed and hope Logitech refines it soon.", "rating": "neg"}

The camera started flickering, and on inspection I saw a bunch of stuff had corroded inside.  I'm not super handy, but handy enough (and CHEAP) that i figured something could be shorting so I took a TINY wire brush and piece of abrasive cloth and polished all the corrosion I could see, it was a success!

Everything set up fine and it was a breeze to get connected, however, I ran some speed tests (...) before shutting down AT&T; service - went to different parts of house and tested wifi and also tested both wired.  The results were surprising - my AT&T; which is lowest service you can get, consistently outperformed with about 70-80% better download and 30% better upload speeds.  As I got closer to Netgear, ti did perform better but never outperformed AT&T; at even the furthest location.Then I wired them - AT&T; router performed the same wired or wifi, while the Netgear doubled in download speed wired (same upload  - like Time Warner caps it there).  Since I was speed testing, thought I'd check my Verizon hot spot over cell (disconnected from the wifi's in the house) - it WAY outperformed the ALL the wifi in the house.So, I'm going to research a new router with better wifi capabilities and return this product.May 13 UPDATE: To solve my problem, I purchased a cable modem and router separately.  Apparently, combos are notorious for poor WiFi, which since I don't have remotely the fastest internet service I didn't think would impact me.  It did!

The remote buttons aren't exactly clear as to their purpose and require some fidgeting to figure them out.

So when you mount a microphone on this mount it will be able to wobble from side to side and transfers the sound to the microphone.  It might not seem like much but it is actually very noisy when you hear the final video.  I had to put a piece of tissue paper on the A65 and then slide on the adapter to make it fit tightly.  That did fix it but it is inconvenient and should not be required.If you are using the adapter to mount a microphone, you will have problems.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Clumsy case not worth your time or money", "body": "I am a frequent iPad 2 user that uses it all day long.  Previously, I used a Targus VersaVu swivel case without a keyboard, for about three years.  After so much use, the case was showing a lot of wear.  I've been looking for a new case with a keyboard, but wasn't impressed with anything that I found.  I came across the New Trent Airbender clam shell case with keyboard and gave it a try.  The plastic construction is solid and looks nice, however, it is too cumbersome to use on a daily basis.  The simple act of trying to open it and positioning the screen takes too much time and effort.  The hinge is very stiff, making it difficult to slide the screen over the keyboard and place it behind the notch that holds the screen in place.The locking hinge slides in and out from front to back, allowing you to position the screen at various angles, and can be detached from the keyboard and placed further back.  This is a nice option if you're working at a desk and would like more distance between the keyboard and the screen.  The problem I had with the center hinge system is that it allows left to right movement of the screen, making it a bit unstable.The keyboard performed well, and the size of the keys was acceptable.  Unfortunately, the rest of the design overshadows the somewhat nice keyboard.Overall, if you are a frequent iPad user and are used to simply flipping open a case such as a Targus VersaVu for quick use of the iPad, you will be very disappointed in this case.  You definitely need two hands and some effort to open this case.  Having to do this all day was a real inconvenience.  It would have been nice to have a keyboard, but the cumbersome and clumsy method of opening the case and positioning the screen isn't worth the aggravation.I returned this case to Amazon and purchased an updated Targus Versavu case, model # THZ156US.  This case states that it's for an iPad 3 & 4, but it fits an iPad 2 as well.  Although it doesn't have a keyboard, it's a very nice case with grooves for three screen positions.  I will continue to look for another keyboard case, but cannot recommend the New Trent Airbender at all.", "rating": "neg"}

Reception is excellent in my area.  The unit displayed all the available channels.  They all came in clearly.  But after 24 hours, I turned on the unit to find no program data.  I must have done something wrong, so I went through the entire process again, ensuring that I waited 24 hours (this time, just to be safe, I waited 30 hours).  I turned on the unit, and again, no data.  I tried one more time.  No luck.  I called Toshiba.

It's abrasive to listen to.It is my opinion that the short 10 inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speaker.This CB radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road.

{"title": "FUD - a perfect example", "body": "FUD - Fear, uncertainty, doubt.According to Wikipedia, \"the term originated to describe disinformation tactics in the computer hardware industry and has since been used more broadly. FUD is a manifestation of the appeal to fear.\"Still Wikipedia, quoting Eric S. Raymond: \"The idea, of course, was to persuade buyers to go with safe [...] gear rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to people who stuck with [...], but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors' equipment [...]\".HDMI is all-digital for both sound and picture. As such, it either works or it doesn't and, when it doesn't work, you will know immediately. There's really nothing in-between. If a claim is made that the Monster is 'more reliable' or that it 'lasts longer', I can't see how such claim can be backed - does the hundred-dollar cable last 20 times longer than than the five-dollar cable? And, if it does, do we REALLY care that a cable supporting a standard that may be obsolete in 5 years COULD last for 100 years?By the way, I do not challenge the claim of high quality for this cable. It appears to be well built. However, it is quality not needed and, in my view, not worth paying for. The way most of us use cables is: we plug them at the back of our electronic boxes and, if they work on 'day one' they are likely to work in the exact same fashion on day 1000 because they are not going to be subjected to any physical or thermal stress and the materials used to build them are not easily degradable. While 'quality' was important for analog cables where good quality made all the difference in the world, the digital wires either transmit the digits or they don't. If they do, they all work the same, the $1 HDMI cable gives you the exact same 'performance' the $100, gold-plated cable does.The claims that seem to suggest that these expensive wires allow more Gigabytes of data to pass through and the implied suggestion that you would get a less bright image or a less crisp sound if you used a two-dollar cable are NOT true. The HDMI is a published standard and there is a minimum data throughput that must be supported. If it is, then the device is HDMI compliant and you will get everything that HDMI promises to deliver. If some cable exceeds the specified throughput, it's nice but it's irrelevant because no electronic component that's HDMI compliant would attempt to push more bytes through the wire than the standard specifies. If they did, they'd violate the specs and would not sell very well. If your electronic component had an HDMI port that called for an HDMI cable that exceeded the HDMI published standards, then it would no longer be called an HDMI port but a proprietary, non-standard solution.The following are the HDMI 1.3 specs and ALL certified HDMI 1.3 cables (including the five-dollar wires and the Monster) are going to support them. Whatever 'extra' the M Series offers is useless because no HDMI-connected hardware component is going to ask for more.Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px  25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px  25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px  1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px  19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)My suggestion: search Amazon for \"hdmi cable 1.3\" and make an informed price/quality decision before you buy._____________________________________Note:I noticed a typical FUD statement that has been posted on this page in the form of a video. The presenter suggests that all signals, including 'digital' get degraded when passing through a wire because of the 'laws of physics'. The key word in his presentation is that 'IF YOU HAVE A REALLY LONG CABLE' then you may get into trouble. This is true. You can't have a 100 ft. HDMI cable or a one mile-long cable. Eventually, unless your signal, digital or analog, is boosted in some way, it's going to die and you won't be able to decode it at the other end.However, this is NOT the point. This HDMI cable is NOT 'really long'. In fact, it is REALLY SHORT and, no matter how much FUD is inserted into the discussion, on 6 ft. or 8 ft. cables, you are NOT going to get a 'better' picture just because you pay 100 times more for a wire.Unless the vendor comes up with some unbiased tests showing that, on 6 ft. or on 8 ft. cables the less expensive brands loses 'bits' to the degree that the receiving device can't correct for the loss while the expensive brand does not, this is nothing but FUD.", "rating": "neg"}

Would I recommend them? Only if they fixed the noise and clairified the instructions better.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Pay-up a little and get something else", "body": "Overall it's an okay device - sturdy, good battery life, solid browser and media player. I've always liked Blackberry and am somewhat saddened by their fall from grace. I bought the device just to see what it was like after several dramatic price cuts. It's good, but it is not special. I also have an iPad that I disliked at first, but after buying the Playbook I find the iPad experience to be better. I've also played with Samsung's tablets and like them better than the iPad. The screen size is too small, which I knew going into the purchase. I feel that any device with 7-inch screen is not worth it. Playbook is pretty heavy and I don't like that either, but some people might find the weight difference marginal. The Blackberry App World is small and there isn't a single one that I have bought. The device now serves as an expensive web-browser for me, something I already get from my Kindle Fire and iPad. A final thought, the navigation around the menus and especially certain apps is not quite intuitive. I have found myself very confused and frustrated trying to exit a screen that doesn't have an exit button for me (the device itself doesn't have a home button either, something common with other tablets)...the exit is all in the swipe...somewhere...if you just know where the swipe spot is... Bottomline, I would recommend holding off until the device is much cheaper or just pay-up and get a competing device. Google Nexus, Samsung Tab or Apple iPad aren't much more expensive and the user experience is better.", "rating": "neg"}
{"title": "Expensive trash", "body": "When shopping for a tablet I decided to try a Dell. All other tablets I own are apple. I ordered a XPS 10 and had it less than a week when I could see that this is garbage.First, it is sooo slow aside of my iPads, I don't even like to use it.I won't write an email on it because almost every time, before I press send, the tablet goes to another random screen or back to the main email screen and I lose everything I wrote.When I type on the Dell tablet, especially noticeable with emails, the on screen keyboard covers half the screen, and I can't scroll to see what I am typing. I have to keep closing the keyboard and bring it up again. That takes a lot of extra time. (Then I lose the email anyway).When I set up the tablet it told me to set a password. I can't remove it, so every time I want to do anything I have to type in a password. I don't need a password. This is for MY use in MY house.The tablet restarts at least once every couple days. Suddenly it will just restart and I lose everything, and it closes any windows I have open, and won't retrieve them.And the design is not well thought out. All ports are on the bottom. Do you know that a tablet rests in the persons lap? So the charger and USB ports, on the bottom, are in the way.After I had this one week, I was already shopping for a new iPad. I hate this tablet. I don't think I can GIVE it away. I wouldn't offer this junk to a relative, they will think its a joke. I feel like I've been ripped off. If I knew what junk this was, I wouldn't have bought it.The description for this tablet should say...Slow, glitchy, windows close randomly, bad design, you won't like this one.I wrote to Dell about my issues with this tablet, just as I explained above. Today I got a nice long email from them saying (over and over) they are sorry and they understand. That's all. I won't deal with this company ever again. I will replace this soon with another ipad.

I thought the 2300 would be that much better because of the more powerful subwoofer and amplifier.I might be writing a different review if the thing had worked.  The subwoofer is powerful, but the satellite speakers had a defect out of the box:  the left channel created static at almost all frequencies.  Only at the softest listening levels did it work without noise.  I replaced the satellites and the same thing happened with the new set.  Then failed altogether.  I plugged in some good old Radio Shack speakers and the set sounds fine.  So, out of four satellites, only one speaker worked as it should.  Not very good value.I am back to using the Z-4, which I cannot recommend more highly.  They are reliable and clean, and are a much better buy all 'round.  Approach the 2300 with caution.Update 12/8/10:  After replacing the defective 2300 satellites with Radio Shack speakers, I have been using the system successfully until the other day when the right channel began dropping out intermittently.  A little jiggling with the RCA inputs from the speakers could bring the sound back, but no more.  The right channel is gone forever and the subwoofer is headed for the trash.  Perhaps it is reparable but, as I can see no way to open the subwoofer to find out, that's that.  I was burned royally on this one.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Such a bad experience so far that it's almost comical", "body": "Roxio has made an enemy today.Unless their e-mail tech support produces stellar results, their name is forever tarnished in my mind and I will never purchase their crap software again.Okay, installed smoothly, has nice tutorials, looks pretty good. Doesn't work.Before you claim pilot error: I am using the latest Mac OS on a new MacBook Pro with 4GB. I was running no other apps at the time. I used the built-in OEM DVD drive. I used new, clean media. I installed updates to Toast. I did everything correctly.First project was to burn some sample files taken with a FLIP camera onto a DVD. That actually went smoothly. It was about a 1:1 conversion time. My minor complaint are that the media browser is kind of slow and clunky and is not good when you have hundreds of files, and doesn't support drag-and-drop (although it supports the \"finder's\" drag and drop. Oddly inconsistent.) It's much more convenient to simply drag-and-drop your video files from Lightroom 3, or perhaps the finder, than to use their browser.I've never fully understood the full concept of this software since so many of the things (like making audio or data discs) you can do natively in the Mac desktop or from inside of iTunes. The ONLY REASON I wanted this software was to burn HIGH-DEF files onto a standard DVD. (Yes, I know it will hold much less than a Blu-Ray disk would - that's not the issue.)Then things got bad...FIRST - in microscopic type you'll find that this particular feature, which is highly touted on the packaging, isn't included!!! That's like buying Macaroni and Cheese and finding out the cheese is sold separately. Idiots. You have to pay another $20 to download the HD plug-in! And then these rip-off artists, straight out of sleazy used car dealer school, try to sell you a backup disk for a whopping $17 extra, AND THEN, they try to sell you undercoating, er, I mean, a $6 insurance policy. Apparently if you lose your computer or have to otherwise re-download the software THAT YOU PAID FOR, they won't let you unless you coughed up the six buck insurance UP FRONT. WHAT A SCAM!!! If you fall for it, you end up paying an extra $43 on top of what you already paid, to get a feature that is supposed to be part of the package!Then things got REALLY bad...Okay, so I went to burn 10 minutes of high-def Flip video. It chugged away for OVER AN HOUR and then LOCKED UP at the 99% mark. For kicks, I tried it again, with 1 minute of some different video. Again it LOCKED UP at 99%. IT LOCKED UP BAD. I couldn't eject the disk - I couldn't exit the program (\"Abort\" was active, but it too locks up). You have to use Activity Monitor to force quit the app. EVEN AFTER A RESTART I couldn't eject the disk! DISK UTILITY wouldn't even eject the disk! I did a hard-power restart, and the Mac wouldn't boot - you could hear it trying to make sense of this bad disc, but never got past the blue screen. I've never seen such behavior in a Mac. Finally, on the SECOND HARD POWER CYCLE, the Mac said \"enough of this s***!\" and kicked the disk out and proceeded to boot fine again.If you look on Roxio's own user forum, YOU'LL SEE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM, YET THEY CONTINUE TO SELL BAD SOFTWARE, and they continue to rip you off for the plug-in that doesn't work either. This software has a lot of other features, most of which I don't care about, and based on this experience, I doubt I'll take the time and suffer the frustration of trying them, so you're on your own there.As a software engineer myself, it's hard to say this, but this company needs to fail, or reorganize or something. Every engineer responsible for shipping this P.O.S. code should be booted out of the industry. If you worked on this project, don't even dream of submitting a resume to my company. Go to work tomorrow and punch your boss in the nose for limiting your future opportunities.I spent hours of my life composing this review so you won't have to suffer my frustration.Please click that this review was helpful, so these jokers get the message that they can't sell non-functioning products.FOLLOW-UP:Another lame finding, and I'm not sure this Roxio/Sonic's limitation or the Blu-ray standard, but it limits you to 98 video files on a disc. That might sound like a lot, especially considering you only get about 30 minutes of video or less on a standard DVD, but as most home movies (such as done with the Flip) are made up of dozens of 3-10 second clips, I had only filled up half the DVD before Toast complained that I couldn't add any more files.Yet another lame finding: and again, I don't know if this is their fault, or the DVD standard - but as Toast burns all these clips as individual movies (rather than chapters) you can't skip any scenes by pressing the CHAPTER+ keys! And you know how boring some home video can be! I hope future editions (if they're still in business) can support generating these files as chapters.UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: ;^)While the shameful sales practices remain, I will give them half-credit that not long after my rant, they released an update that fixed the \"stuck at 99%\" bug and the resulting disc appears to be recognized on all BluRay players - however I then ran into another bad problem. The navigation formatting of the disc was not correct - it was not playing the correct clip with the correct \"chapter\". Many of the clips would end up jumping back to the first clip, and most would never get played at all. I wish I could give you more information on this, but I got so exhausted with trying to figure out their bugs that I just worked around it...I am now successfully using their software, but in a very limited way: when I want to make a disc of my home movie clips, I pull them all into iMovie, add my titles, and then export a single HD video file of the whole project (I've exported as 720p and 1080p), which I then drag into Toast. After several discs, I think I can now proclaim that Toast has no problem with transcoding a single HD video file onto to a standard DVD-R disc for playback on a BluRay player, but I hate software that \"trains\" you to work differently or limit your options in order to work around their bugs. If you can live with this major limitation, go for it, but let's hope a better product is on its way someday.Also keep in mind: I am reviewing this single feature. I have not used Toast for its other capabilities.UPDATE TO THE UPDATE TO THE UPDATE:WILL THE AGONY EVER STOP???Here we are, almost 3 years later, and this product is still giving me headaches. I use this product maybe once every 6 months, so it's hardly been any kind of value for me considering all the grief it has caused. Now a new thing...A couple of months ago, I switched Macs. I couldn't just clone the old one, so I basically just transferred my apps and data from the old Mac to the new one. Of course, the one piece of software that did not work was the HighDef plug-in that I complained about so bitterly in the past. Now, as you recall, I did not pay for their idiotic \"insurance policy\" and had long since forgotten about it, so today, when I tried to re-download the plug-in THAT I PAID FOR to the new computer, it would not let me. EVEN IF I HAD paid for the insurance policy, it expires after 2 years, so it still would have refused me. So... I'm completely screwed by Roxio AGAIN. Apparently I have no right to access a digital file that I paid for unless I pay them another $20 extortion money. Is this even legal? What would the trade commission say about this? - they don't give you a hard-copy and you're screwed if you switch computers in the future. I HATE THIS PRODUCT, AND THIS COMPANY IS THE MOST INFURIATINGLY NON-CUSTOMER FOCUSED COMPANY I'VE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF WORKING WITH. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS NICKLE AND DIME YOU TO DEATH INSTEAD OF PROVIDING A PRODUCT THAT THEY WILL SUPPORT.  I think I'm going to spend the $300 and just buy Apple's Final Cut Pro - assuming IT has high-def capabilities built in. How are these clowns still in business?UPDATE TO THE UPDATE TO THE UPDATE TO THE UPDATE:OK. Since I was taught to say nice things as well, I will commend Roxio for one thing. As I mentally prepared myself to do battle over the stupid HD plug-in fiasco, they actually responded to my inquiry. The fist answer wasn't very good, but when I explained it again, they actually sent me a pointer to a utility to help me reinstall the plug-in and it worked... and I didn't have to give them another twenty bucks. So, thank you Roxio, for resolving this issue in a proper manner.", "rating": "neg"}

Now, I can use my Kindle fire HD as it was intended.  I also have a desktop, two laptops, and two Roku players connected to this router, and Internet usage is a breeze on all devices.The problem is with the feature that allows the user to hook an external hard drive up to the router and access that external hard drive from all computers.  Supposedly, this router is compatible with my Western Digital MyBook hard drive.  However, when I hooked up the hard drive, I noticed that some of my media files started changing into folders with 0 kb of data!  The Cisco online support chat person was unable to help me.  I thought I had lost some of my irreplaceable pictures for good.  Luckily, I was able to find a discussion thread on the Cisco forums entitled &#34;Media files changed to folder types&#34;.  A fellow user noted that the program Recuva can be used to recover the files that this router corrupted, and I used it to restore my pictures.Unfortunately, neither the online chat nor the forum posts provided me with a solution to the problem.  The bottom line is that this router will randomly destroy the files on your external hard drive by turning them into empty folders.  The files can be recovered with Recuva, but having to repair files constantly is not acceptable.  Given that I only paid up for this router in order to have the USB feature, I view this purchase as a mistake.  If all you want is a fast, reliable router, there are cheaper models available.  If you plan to hook up a hard drive and access your data via the router, do not buy this model.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Pathetic quality, pathetic support.", "body": "In my nearly 30 years of working with PC's, by far my most frustrating experience has been trying to get this sound card to work with Windows 7 64 bit.I disabled my on-board sound, then proceeded numerous times to install either the Diamond drivers or the C-Media drivers, which had been recommended by some users. The sound is fairly good initially, but within 24 hours the sound is riddled with static and audio dropouts. Rebooting helps a little - until the next time.Of course I've been to the Diamond web site, one of the worst-designed sites I've ever seen, by the way. Here is what displays when I try to download current drivers that work, if there are any:\"Diamond Downloads is currently down. Please visit us later [Friday 3rd of May 2013 12:44:20 PM]You may click here to try again.\" The site has been down for the better part of a week and maybe longer for all I know. I have finally and belatedly concluded that they just don't care.Bottom line: if you are trying to get the Diamond Extreme Sound 7.1 to work reliably with Windows 7 64 bit, good luck. If you have succeeded, kindly share your voodoo secret with the rest of us.

This is one fairly useless peice of equipment in the scheme of things.

Music? Even with USB expect long downloads and only acceptable quality..not a true music lover's delight. Some tape players sound better. As to business use...not worth the hype. Iffy and slow writing capabilities, with cumbersome calendar and contact list functionality. And battery life? Forget about it! I give this a 2 rating because I did find the storage of documents useful to a point, especially for editing speeches on the road. Otherwise, the hype doesn't tranlsate into reality. And movies..why would you on such a small screen? I have found the wireless web on my cellphone more versatile and useful -- get directions, restautrant recommendations and menus, news, games, AvantGo, newspaper and magazine articles, even poetry and ebooks in WAP format if I want them, with video coming soon.

But if you're the careful type who treats your iPad with care, this cover will last, and really is a cute addition to your HK collection.I detract one star for the slightly flimsy-ish back cover.EDIT:  4/11/13I'll have to adjust my rating and give this item 2 stars. I'm very gentle with the iPad and was extremely careful with this case, and still, the back cover suddenly stopped fitting. I coudn't figure it out until I examined the corners of the case. There were tiny hairline cracks in every corner and near-microscopic ridges where 'chips' of plastic had apparently broken off. Again, I'm extremely gentle with my iPad, as it is a costly purchase to begin with, so there's no other explanation except to say that this is junk.The smart cover still works, at least.", "rating": "neg"}

So informed seller SF Planet & they were good enough to send me another similar one fast free of charge saying this could be an isolated case. But this new one exhibited same problem. Then I borrowed one and walla! it worked perfectly. To confirm I ordered a similar one (in length and price) from a seller Cmple (from amazon marketplace) and that worked perfectly as well.

This one worked as it should also.I'm writing this to forewarn people in case they are planning to buy and/or if bought this one already and doesn't seem to work then you should know the problem is with the cable - not with your set-up or linking equipments.SF Planet was gracious enough to replace the 1st purchase free of charge (w/free shipping) and although we had to exchange couple of emails regarding this matter eventually refunded everything.I applaud SF Planet for their effort.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Lots of Bugs and Glitches", "body": "After reviewing several DVD recorders, I chose this Samsung model. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed, and I ended up returning it. There are two main problems with this model:1) Like all other DVD recorders right now, it is picky about what brand of DVD-Rs you use. I am not interested in shopping around for only certain brands. If it says \"DVD-R,\" then it should be able to use ALL DVD-Rs.2) While playing back the DVDs is fine when you use this exact player, there are problems that pop up when you play the discs on other DVD players. I experienced these discs locking up, skipping, or simply not playing on a variety of other players, even one also made by Samsung. Imagine if your VCR recorded tapes that were ONLY playable by that same VCR--you couldn't bring them into other rooms/friends' houses/etc. People wouldn't stand for that, so I don't see why it should be any different with DVD recorders.In sum, I think that there are problems with ALL DVD recorders that still need to be worked out before they will be useful to the general public.

I admit that when I was looking at cases that it seemed really neat to have a blue toothed keyboard as the cover and back-lit at that!!  Yes..the keyboard paired up nicely with the iPad air and it literally felt like a tiny laptop.  It felt pretty neat. But then those natural habits I mentioned earlier kinda kicked in.  It breaks my heart to say that I have to return it.  I want to make it clear that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  WRONG THE PRODUCT.  Just things I did not consider at all before buying it.  :(After inserting IPad air, again, it literally feels like a little laptop.  So being that I was on the home page my thumb instinctively started looking for a mouse tracking pad to place the cursor into the URL for web browsing. Then the instinct to pick it up and use my fingers kicked in because there is no mouse track pad and that's when it hit me that this case isn't going to work for me. I loved the idea of the backlit keyboard as part of the cover but what it really boils down to is that you STILL  need to use your fingers to navigate AND you have to pick up the entire case to do that especially in portrait mode.  Trying to navigate using fingers and a case that doesn't fold all the way around just doesn't work for me.  It was truly uncomfortable trying to use the iPad when the case feels like a book.  These are just things to consider before buying.  And it's only a 130 viewing angle so navigating at all is kinda uncomfortable. So like I've said, nothing wrong with this product at all!!!

It worked for 2 more months then broke again. I was super fed up with Denon and done wasting my time.About a year later, I decided I would try to have them fix it again. I got onto Denon's site and followed all there instructions, filled out a repair form from there official website and it gave me a ticket number and the address to send the unit to. On the repair form I even said &#34;it is a bad HDMI board&#34;. After $60 to ship the unit to Denon. Three weeks later the e-mail I got back stated that I had a beyond repair HDMI board and that it wasn't something that Denon could replace and that I owed them $47 for them to ship the unit back, or they would scrap it.I highly recommend not buying from Denon unless you want to make your wallet rain on them and end up with a product that is an expensive paper weight.", "rating": "neg"}

I used to shoot wedding photography, and would be up all day with 2 camera bodies + lenses, with the black rapid dual camera strap (which is an absolutely amazing dual camera strap), which allows both camera bodies to hang off your shoulders comfortably and safely.Back to Jolby's camera strap, as mentioned by a prior reviewer, the main failings of this camera strap is the camera does not slide up and down the strap, thus, when you raise the camera, the shoulder pad will move on your shoulder, creating friction.In addition, the hardware is plastic, vs metal on the black rapid R straps. Finally, the mechanism to extend and contract the strap amount is bulky. The only nice thing about this strap is the camera mount is very compact and swivels nicely. The black rapid R strap also swivels, but isn't as compact.Because of the plastic hardware, and inability to slide up and down the strap makes this not a usable design. I definitely wouldn't trust 4-5k of camera + lens on this strap.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Cheap Feel, Terrible Battery Life", "body": "I have had one of these for about 3yrs and have finally had enough of it. My biggest gripes are the cheap battery holder door, no low battery indicator, and terrible battery life.When the keyboard has fully charged batteries it works well, the touchpad tracks great and it is very easy to type on this keyboard. The problem is, there is no indicator that the batteries are dying until the keyboard starts exhibiting very erratic behavior. The first thing that goes is the mouse, it becomes very difficult to track, and it takes longer to wake up the keyboard. On top of that, the numlock comes on automatically as the batteries die; try typing your password with the numlock on and no indication that it is on. There is nothing to indicate when caps lock or numlock is on, and it is very annoying when it turns on in the middle of typing something because the batteries are getting low.Then the right mouse click starts sticking, and anytime you attempt to highlight something it starts opening windows or scrolling unexpectedly. If this keyboard had a battery indicator, even a little 3 bar LCD battery indicator it would be 10x better.The other problem is battery life itself. I have tried 3 different types of rechargeable batteries, yet I am lucky if they last more than a few days.  Although it cost a lot more I am going to try the Logitech diNovo Edge just because it advertises a 2 month charge. I'll be happy if it just lasts 2 weeks per charge.The last problem is the terribly cheap battery door.

But I assume that you want a consistent signal and not one where devices of various brands out of the sudden are no longer connected and the only way of resolving it is to restart the wireless router.  My iPhone and IPad run on the 5 ghz network and when they lose the signal they automatically sign in under the 2.4 ghz network.  Once that happens the internet is awfully slow.  We have another iPhone 4s that cannot connect to the 5 ghz and therefore is always on the 2.4, but the speed is by far faster than my Iphone 5 when it automatically signs in on the 2.4 after losing the 5 ghz network.  Why remains a mystery.  The range is not good at all.  When you close the door in the room right next to the living room (where the router is located) you see how the signal decreases instantly.  D-Link claims an amazing range, but fact is that our previous 8 year old Netgear router outperformed this one here by far.

Surely, I am not a pro, but I know a decent photo. What I found after a lot of fiddling around and taking photos here and there, I could produce pretty decent photos.Well, it was a short lived love affair. Just after landing in SXM. I wanted to begin taking photos immediately. The first shot, was blurry as heck, and I couldn't figure the problem, I checked every setting, which all appeared fine. At the resort, I read every possible article, plus my own camera manual over, again just to be sure I hadn't caused a problem, or missed something. The problem was that every photo showed as blurry or out of focus. I made contact with Tamron by email, hoping for suggestions,but only received a PDF form to complete, and mail the lens in for repair. I am devastated, I thought to myself, maybe its the camera, my Canon 60D. I purchased a new one. Canon 6D, and quickly learned they take a different lens all together. I then loaded the lens onto a friends Canon 50D. Same results. I cannot believe how easily it is to get ripped off, especially after reading so many positive reviews. Perhaps I got the one built on Friday. However $500.00 is nothing to sneeze at, and you can bet I will never spend another dime on a Tamron product.

{"title": "Mac Happy for Backups (Somewhat)", "body": "I'm a strong believer in making backups: I've had too many hard disks crash to ignore backups. I make one backup locally and one backup offline (currently via Backblaze).For the past four or so years, I've been using Apple's Time Capsule, a two-in-one concept: it's an \"n\" router as well as a backup drive. With anywhere from two to four Macs (all laptops), Time Capsule worked well, until recently.Now that we're using Netflix via Apple TV (streaming video) and Xbox Live, the demand on our wireless network has gone up considerably. My old Time Capsule, although n-band, is *single* band. Doing some research, I got the sense I needed a dual-band wireless router (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz). This meant that I either bought a new Time Capsule (which is dual-band), or I seek another solution. I did the latter since the two-in-one approach, coupled with Apple's lack of support for USB hard drives on a wireless network with respect to Time Machine, leaves me uncomfortable.I ended getting an ASUS dual-band wireless router, which has worked well, but not flawlessly (I should write this review as well). I then connected the Cloudbox, via these steps.1. Connected the Cloudbox to the wireless router with the supplied ethernet cable.2. Connected the Cloudbox to power, and waited about 10 minutes for it to boot up (the flashing blue light becomes solid). I don't know how long the boot actually took, I just left it and returned after 10 minutes.I then got on my MacBook Pro, and in the Finder, went to the Network. Viola, there was the \"LaCie-Cloudbox\"! I connected to the Cloudbox as a guest (individual accounts are not required) and could see the folders and content already on the Cloudbox. They supply a few folders (Music, Photos, Videos) as examples of how you might share information.Setting up Time Machine to use the Cloudbox was easy: I went into Time Machine's preferences and pointed at the \"LaCie-Cloudbox,\" and continued to sign in as a guest. I did this for each of our four MacBooks, one a day, to give each one time to conduct an initial backup before proceeding. These backups sit next to the supplied folders I mentioned above. After a few weeks, no issues.For the purpose of using the Cloudbox to back up Macs via Time Machine...this gizmo does the trick nicely.** UPDATE: 23 January 2014 **I initially rated Cloudbox as five stars since setup was fairly painless and it seemed to work well. Now that time has passed, I've had two issues: 1) performance over a wireless network is a dog, and 2) the Time Machine backups for two of my four Macs continually fail.With regard to the first issue (performance), it's not a big deal usually as long as the Time Machine backups are running smoothly, since Time Machine knows what to back up (i.e., it doesn't have to compare file attributes between devices) and it only backs up what it needs. When the Time Machine backup failed, I tried another Mac program (SmartBackup) to back up to Cloudbox, but it was awful, since this program first compares file attributes (i.e., it doesn't track what needs to be backed up, it has to figure it out); even after the initial backup, SmartBackup-to-Cloudbox would take hours.With regard to the second issue, I don't know why the Time Machine backups were failing, since all Time Machine told me is that the backups failed. I wonder if this issue is related to performance as well.In any event, I checked to make sure that the Cloudbox firmware was current (it is), so I'm stuck as far as what to do. Since I can't rely on Cloudbox, I now back up my Mac using SmartBackup and a wired Western Digital My Passport external drive: these daily backups take just a few minutes.", "rating": "neg"}

I did it because I have had many great Seagate products and because with new technologies the problem may be on the customer's lack of basic expertise or patience.Well, my apologizes to those who tried to prevent my purchase with their good advice.  You were right.The good about the product is that it does deliver solid streams of video or audio content wirelessly to multiple devices.  However, it takes forever to write or upload your stuff into Seagate Central.  It's incredibly slow to receive your input.  AND, even worse, it's unreliable.  Not usually, but every now and then, it does a \"disappearing act\" from your list of drives.  Which is incredibly scary...For all the good it does, I, and obviously many others, don't have any use for a device that is slow AND unreliable.  I hope Seagate keeps working on the concept.  I would concentrate on expanding the storage capacity of Seagate Wireless Plus 1 TB Mobile Device Storage with Built-In Wi-Fi Streaming as a perfect solution.  Until then, I would advise people to wait..UPDATE: I'm very disappointed that Amazon has decided, for months now, to cook the ratings of this bad product by using VINE reviewers.  Vine is a respectable program when used to produce reviews for new products that need people to give them a try.  That is not how VINE has been used here.  This \"expensive\" product has been given for free to people that are more likely to consequently give it a high grade.

Called customer support, i was told to buy a new map. Now myself, if i have something that is not working, why would i pay for a new map. The old map would work if the touch screen was responding. So as far as i'm concerned, 20 months usage for $400 is not worth it. And in this day and age, to have bad customer support is beyond my understanding. My origional review gave it three (3) stars, now I am giving it one (1) star for the time it did work.Here is my old review:This is my second Garmin, my first is the 2720 street pilot. that is a good unit, but very bulky. This I liked because of the size and I assumed it would be far superior to my old unit. Our first use was when we flew to Oklahoma to drive a new motorhome back to California. It did not know about campgrounds that I passed on highway 40. It took me to restaurants that did not exists (actually into a residential neighborhood for a BBQ restaurant that did not exist.) It took us to gas station in California that the unit said were in the fields. As for the MSN direct, if it wasn't free, I would have cancelled it. You have to be in a city (that has service) for 2 to 3 days before it knew anything. In this day and age, that is pretty unacceptable. This is an 85 percent GPS. I love it 85 percent of the time, not exactly what I was expecting from Garmin. It also has a problem doing a route. When we were driving, I wanted to tell it where I wanted to stay along the route, you can't do that. You can only add one stop along the way. See those three stars up top of this review, remove one of them. This thing cost over $400.00 and should work better.Pros. It is fast, you can see the screen all the time, it works on the California Delta.This is my second unit, so it is not like I have to get used to using it. I am only telling you experience.

This thing is pretty much an electronic version of the Magic Slate Boards (where you write on the grey film, then pull it up to erase) we had as kids.What dismays me the most about this product is, compared to taking notes or drawing in a looseleaf notepad, at least with the notepad you get to KEEP your items. With this, you MUST delete your content before you can use it again.I suppose this is a case of caveat emptor, I should have learned more about the product before purchasing -- nothing on the packaging promises to do the things I assumed it would, but to say this item is totally useless is an understatement.

{"title": "Not as good as original Titans", "body": "I bought a pair of Titans about 1.5 years ago and i loved them, so much so I talked my friends into buying them.  The old Titans had a volume control on the cord as the cord itself was very sturdy and clear and you can see the braid through it.  These ones, however, do not have the volume control and cord is cheap plastic coating which feels like it will break sooner than later.These new Titans pale in comparison to the old ones.  I ordered a pair and once I got past the cheap feel and look, I tried them on only to find that one earbud has a \"leak\" that comes from inside the housing.  This defeats the sound quality as in order to get the best sound and bass response, there must be a good seal.  I noticed it at first because one bud would make the \"popping\" sound of the bud sealing in, which I believe comes from the movement of the driver.  The other bud did not make this sound.  When music was played, there was a noticeable sound difference between the two buds, with the sealing one sounding much better, clearer, louder and more bass.  I swapped ears, same thing. I tried the other set of silicon tips, same thing.  So, I figured I was unlucky and got a defective pair so I returned them.  I got a different color for the second ones and sure enough, same exact problem.  If you take the silicon tip off and gently blow into the ear bud (making a seal on the tip with your lips), the one that \"pops\" and seals won't let any air through.  The one bud that doesn't seal, so much air blows through you can hear and feel it coming out the little hole in the back.  Again, this is on two separate brand new Titans: one black, one blue.  These new ones are garbage.  I will be returning the second pair for a refund only and looking elsewhere from now on. Thank goodness for Amazons great return policy.", "rating": "neg"}
{"title": "2 Defective Units & No Return or Warranty!", "body": "UPDATED 4-10-14:I bought 2 of these a month apart, one for a friend about 3-4 weeks after I had mine. I'm embarrassed that BOTH units are completely non-functional now, mine at 5 week mark and his before even 4 weeks! First, it started skipping during DVD playback (though not CD playback), then the bad disc errors started on mine, then it refused to recognize anything, even a laser cleaner CD. The USB input also did not work at that time.My friend brought me his newer one to use, he had already had problems with skipping and freezing during DVD playback and errors on CD recognition, but within 24 hours of bringing it to my house, it went from dissolving the film (like old VHS lines through pictures), then bad disc errors--refused to recognize ANY discs, DVD/CD & cleaner disc--so I tried the USB, and out of the 12 songs it started failing on the 4th, with static through the speakers & distortion, so I shut it off finally.Before the bad disc errors, these units start making noises while accessing and playing discs, noise that can be heard over the quiet moments of a DVD or CD, within an hour of the noise starting, both units were dead.I called the seller to try and arrange an exchange for defective items, never imagining that a unit under a month old could not be returned (unless un-opened!). Then I checked Amazon site where I bought them both, and it would not let me return them either. These come with only a 30 day UNOPENED return policy, and a 90 day manufacturer warranty, which I will try next, but I can already tell that no matter how many units they replace, none will work, if 2 units failed within a month of purchase. I'm extremely disappointed with the Sylvania brand and plan to never buy another product made by them. I was excited about the product and didn't realize the return policies on Amazon had deteriorated, nor that the warranty was 90 days--to me that is an obviously defective product if a manufacturer won't warranty it for longer.Buyer beware. I'm going to local Best Buy next time.PREVIOUS: Received a couple days before expected, packaged securely, easy to open tab style box, with remote, warranty (90 days! limited), manual (very small print though so it is hard to read), RCA & YUV cables, no batteries in remote.

Even though the package it came in was vented, it stunk of chemicals, and my wife didn't even want to hold it.Other than the choice in materials, I did like the case.  It seemed strong and durable, has nice features, looks good, and has a nice fit at a nice price.

Here are some problems:- Weak N signal/does not reach rated speeds.  Sitting 5 feet from the router, no obstacles, the best I was able to get was 74Mbps at the 5GHz band.  It's supposed to hit 300Mbps!- The last two routers have required daily reboots, sometimes twice a day - the web interface for the router declares all is good, but in fact the router drops all DNS requests, so no computers can get through. (More specifically, the router assigns itself as the DNS server, instead of passing through the IP addresses for your ISPs servers.  At some point after a reboot the router stops responding to DNS requests, so any DNS lookups fail.  Interestingly, any accesses using an IP address still work, so the connection is active, but the DNS is a problem).

Sometimes they come back, but every once and a while I have to unplug and then replug them into the card to get them to show back up.

While it may not be apparent to the average listener, anyone with a critical ear will quickly pick up on the issues created by Bluetooth audio, and this Logitech adapter is no exception.It seems that Bluetooth audio is fundamentally flawed.  No matter what device I've tried, they all have some pretty significant sound quality issues.  With one unit, you get one type of flaw, with another unit, some other issue.  With this Logitech adapter, it's poor dynamic range, doubling of audio, and seriously compromised reproduction when music gets complicated.  For much of the music that is popular, mixed with an \"in your face\" style, these flaws aren't immediately apparent, but as soon as you attempt to listen to anything else, say a classical piece, or popular music recorded before 1975, or spoken audio from an audio book, the problems become immediately apparent.  Spoken audio in particular reveals the doubling issue, where it almost sounds like a second person is reading the same text albeit slightly behind the main reader.  Classical and classic music reveal the other problem, where any significant transient (quick changes in music content) will make the limited bandwidth of Bluetooth apparent, with portions of the audio spectrum obviously missing or distorted in some other way.It's a shame that Bluetooth has become so popular for audio reproduction, as it just doesn't have sufficient bandwidth to do the job properly.  Some devices are better than others at overcoming the limitations, but none is exempt, and all have issues.

It is apparent that the AC adapter has insufficient power circuitry to filter out the noise and provide a clean DC voltage.  This can be very hard on computer components and make it impossible to listen to decent audio from the computer.To verify my results I moved the adapter to a different AC outlet in a room that had no other electrical equipment to ensure that the noise was not being attenuated from another device, I got the same results.

{"title": "Review of customer service & design...", "body": "At this point, that's all I can review, until I either hear back from the company's customer service division, or until my normal technology problem-solver comes in to sort out a couple of other issues for me and tries to deal with this one as well.I had been contemplating adding a Bluetooth speaker to the technology menage for a little while. I'll be upgrading to a smartphone this year (don't need one at present since I work from home in a poor reception area), so for now my primary interest is finding something that can take the OK (but hard to monitor/control) sound on my Kindle Fire HD and turn it into something better. (Right now, it's adequate for audiobooks, or using headphones, but that's all.) Clearly, a Bluetooth speaker was the solution.This little device is a delight to look at -- simple, streamlined design, a nifty carrying case and, best of all, no wires and cords required. Charge it, and you're good to go. The problem? While I've been able to &#34;pair&#34; my Kindle Fire HD with other Bluetooth devices, it's unable to link up to this speaker. The quick start instructions contained with the device instruct me that simply holding down the center button for three seconds will produce a tone, telling me that it's ready to pair. But -- no tone. Nada. It charges and holds a charge (for a long while, which is encouraging: when not being used, it will actually stay charged for longer than the 8 hours cited by the manufacturer.)So, my first step is to look for troubleshooting instructions. Nothing in the box. On the box, a number that is non-functional. Hmm. Off to the website, where the troubleshooting FAQs all pertain to SimpleAudio's other system, the Roomplayer. No additional phone numbers given, so I send an e-mail to their head office in Glasgow. Followed by another e-mail.This may well be a simple product glitch, since so many other reviewers have had no difficulty with the device. Unfortunately, this is my experience with it and a Kindle that is set up to be Bluetooth ready and plays nicely with other Bluetooth devices. I might normally have postponed writing this review for a few months, until I had prodded their customer service into working through the  issues or had my tech guy see if he could cajole it into cooperating, but Amazon's Vine program requires me to submit some kind of review within a pre-determined time frame, and I'm already past that date.Should I hear back from the technical support folks or find a way to do an end run around what seems to be a basic issue, I'll follow up (I hope) with a more useful review of the functionality. From a design standpoint -- it's about a third the size of the box, lovely and compact -- this is the perfect travel accompaniment and so I'm more than a little dismayed by the failure to complete the basic task of &#34;pairing&#34; it.", "rating": "neg"}

{"title": "Heavy, Flawed, not Mac compatible.", "body": "Ok, so Mac incompatibility aside, this mouse has a grip of cool features on paper, but realistically, I would never think of using this mouse for FPS type games, and would not buy this mouse unless it was a fraction of the cost; due to the right click button being flawed... It feels like it gets hung up on the inner chasis or something. This is completely inexcusable for a quality mouse, and it's an understatement to say that the right click does not work. It actually gets physically stopped by something inside the mouse before the actual switch is clicked. It makes the right click (the second most important button) near-unusable. It sucks and takes 5-or-so pounds to click it past the hang, the it stays depressed until you dig it out.Many, many people complain about this online and I thought it was an exaggeration, but it is not. Without taking the mouse apart and carving the plastic, this will not go away. This defect as well as the heft of this mouse makes this mouse useless for FPS and, in fact, pretty much anything that requires a responsive right click.On the plus side, the sensor was phenomenal, like everyone says. I was able to use 2000dpi and move the mouse very quickly and the cursor was smooth and accurate. The dedicated wheel motion button was a great idea. the onboard memory and profiles rock. The shape was pretty comfy. Umm... So if the mouse was a lot lighter and the right click wasn't useless, I would have kept it, but I ended up returning it and for the first time in my life was very disappointed with Logitech.I want to stress again that the right click, BY DESIGN, is flawed and BARELY works.

But the downsides -- The mouse pad is a joke, it constantly confuses a touch with a click so you will drag or select things you did not expect, and the reactions are not consistant. I suggest you use an external mouse with the Zenbook. Mine failed after 4 months, looks like it is a complete power failure at random times. I will provide an update on the RMA process and the repair.Not sure I like the trend in notebooks of no LAN connection and no VGA connection except with dongles. Also I really noticed the lack of a speaker on/off and volume control. It is a pain to have a set of keys with multiple presses for volume. The ideal netbook needs to have built in LAN and VGA connections, and volume controls.", "rating": "neg"}
{"title": "Works Exactly as Advertised", "body": "Update ---Dropped to 2 stars... .like many users my Slingbox worked for about a year and then died. Do youself a big favor and buy theVulkano Flow Mobile Device for Viewing TV on the Goinstead of the Slingbox----------------------------------I was a bit skeptical about the Slingbox solo - I was concerned that the set-up would be difficult and that the video quality would be poor. Well that simply is not the case, in fact it works a little better than I had hoped. There are a few things you need to consider.1 - This is NOT a wireless device. You will need to have your TV/DVR/Cable Box hear your router or you will need to buy a device such asSlinglink Turbo 1PORT Enet Connection Bridge (SL 150-100)which can use your home's electrical wiring to extend your network (it really is a cool product!).2- You can useSling Media SlingCatcher SC100-100 Universal Media Player for TVto watch your Slingbox remotely on a separate TV. This is great for kids that are away at college and still want to watch their home team sporting events.3- Will \"Sling\" to your Blackberry (Model Dependent) or your iPod/iPhone (Requires the purchase of a separate application).4 - You can also just watch on any computer (Macs included!) once you remotely log into your Slingbox5- Only 1 viewer at a time - meaning if you and your buddy want to watch the Slingbox remotely using two different devices (one of you using an iPhone while the other using a computer or any combination) you are out of luck. The Slingbox will deliver programing to ONE discrete viewing device.6- The Slingbox \"Hijacks\" the TV/DVR/Cable box that it is attached to - meaning that if you are using the Slingbox to view channel 3 - then the person who owns the TV will also have to watch channel 3. It could create a dispute if the owner of the TV decides that they want to watch something different than the person using the Slingbox.7- Need to keep an eye on your network settings - If your router is in Powersave mode your network connection may go to asleep which would make remote viewing impossible.8 - Video quality - we vary depending on your network speed - ideally your network will be able to work at speeds greater than 1Mbps - but it is not necessary. at 1Mbps you can expect video quality to be slight less than what you get using a standard definition television.Final Verdict - Works great - but you really ned to keep you expectation in check. This is not a HD Slingbox and does not deliver to the quality. However, for what I am using it for - it is an outstanding product.5 Stars", "rating": "neg"}

I purchased a Router/dsl modem combo by Netgear from Amazon that I had to return, so to be safe this time I picked this up locally. The set-up was super easy. There are two networks, hence the dual band label. This actually confuses me a bit. I am not quite sure which is better to use, nor which Network is which. However I have chosen to use each and they both seem to be equally fast. Make sure to download the Netgear genie to manage the device and rename networks and user names (although I have only figured how to rename one of the two networks so far).

{"title": "Sexy but disappointing.  Save your receipt.", "body": "I've been a long-time fan of Linksys products and have been pleased with their general reliability for years, until I purchased this product.  I have maintained networks of hundreds of users, so home networking is almost effortless for me.  I set my father's WRT110 up and everything went without a hitch.  Total set-up time took only about 5 minutes, including showing him how to administer it himself.  He has been up and running for nearly three weeks without a problem.  I swore that his connection felt faster than my old WRT54G that I keep at home.  Set-up seemed really easy and basically identical to previous Linksys wireless products I have purchased.  I liked my father's router so much I figured I would replace my aging WRT54G.  I was definitely swayed by the sleek, sexy design, low-profile, and the keen blue lights, but more importantly I actually thought this was a better router.Quite possibly the worst mistake I've made in a long time.  The first WRT110 that I purchased for my own use wouldn't allow me to access the the administration pages.  This wasn't a password issue but a full blown, \"server does not exist\" when attempting to access 192.168.1.1 (the admin web IP address common to all Linksys routers).  That's assuming attempting to access 192.168.1.1 didn't lock the computer up to the point where I was force to Force Quit or End Task on the browser.  This happened to both my PC and my Mac.  It would function as a wired gateway to my cable modem just fine but there was literally no way to configure it to do anything else.  I tried resetting it, unplugging it, and I even thought about sacrificing a chicken and doing a little voo-doo dance naked beneath the moon before I figured the cold autumn air wasn't very conductive towards that type of solution.  Nothing would allow me to configure that particular router.  I even tried the bundled-in software as a last resort and that wouldn't work.I exchanged the defective unit with another WRT110, convinced I just got a bad unit.  I set the replacement one up and Voila!  It worked.  I can administer it just fine and manage to secure my wireless network the way I like.  For some reason this particular unit took about 30 seconds to update settings when my father's only takes about four or five, but I was willing to accept that.  I thought I was good to go until four days later, the router starts locking up hard several times per day.  No activity at all.  Not able to hit 192.168.1.1 and I can't even ping the router.  The lights are on and it indicates activity, but it just doesn't respond.  The only way to get it to come back to life is to unplug its power supply.  After it reboots a few minutes later it will stay up for a few more hours before dying.  I have updated to the most recent version of the firmware (from 1.0.0 to 1.0.04) and the issue seems even more frequent after the firmware update, but my perception of that may be clouded by my frustration and general hatred for this spiteful demon of a router.I'm done with this exercise in frustration and I'm going back to my trusty WRT54G.  My father's WRT110 works great for him, and I hope that other people with this model are able to get the same experience, but I will not be recommending this model to anyone.  I have never had problems like this with any Linksys product before and I still recommend other Linksys products, just not this particular model.

Support could NOT help me.  They had no manuals for it either.  Together, we came to the conclusion that it works on the power supply of the iPad, but had NO materials that told us that for sure.

The quality of the speakers is very good.Earlier I commented that the bass stinks and it needs some serious equalizing to make it pleasant to listen. But that's not entirely true.The woofer is pretty big for a small room and it doesnt perform too well ina small room. But once I moved them to a bigger room, I've never been dissappointed.There's only one con I can associate with these speaks is that they dont look too polished to make a living room feature compared to other prettier speakers from creative etc.I have them always connected to my TV (and now also my projector), watch movies, play games on PS2 and listen to music.

{"title": "Works OK but eats up batteries!", "body": "I love the fact that this mouse takes either a \"AA\" or \"AAA\" batteries because after seven months of use one thing I can definitely tell you is that it eats batteries! I have gone through at least nine batteries in seven months which to me is ridiculous. I have even gone as far as turning off the mouse at the end of the day or removing the battery completely but the battery life is still questionable to me. Oh and I just love the way the battery goes dead without any warning and leaves you sitting there wondering where your cursor has disappeared to. At other times the cursor just freezes up for some unknown reason before it starts to work again.  One other thing is  if you're looking for the manual that comes with it I found mine sandwiched in between the front and back cardboard inserts. It's a silly place to put it and the only reason I found it was due to the fact that I have to recycle paper where I live meaning I had to take the packaging apart. Bottom line is the mouse works OK, has a couple of nice features but for me I'm tired of short-lived battery life, and disappearing cursors so I'm going to see if I can't fix the one that this one replaced.

My problem was twofold, the fit was extremely tight and the location of the release button on one of the rings.You definitely want a tight fit of ring to camera and ring to lens, for the obvious light and secure fit reasons. When I say these were too tight, I mean I had to apply way too much pressure to release them from both lens and camera. I never like having to grip my lenses zoom or focus rings with an excessive amount of pressure as  did when removing these rings.My second issue with this set of rings is the release button of the smallest ring was blocking the release button on the camera. Sometimes I have to quickly switch from a macro configuration to non-macro, with the small ring mounted its very difficult to do a quick switch, especially when the fit is as tight as i mentioned earlier.I've owned the Kenko version of these rings for over a year and they are wonderful but also 4X the price!

Never expected this one exception but:- I tried 2 different drives with the enclosure, one HD & one SSD. Both will mount, but then simple things like opening them or Get Info take a long time, and attempting any file copy will simply freeze it & require to pull the plug.- I tried 2 different USB3 cables, made sure to connect the second connector for extra power.- Both drives worked fine, no errors or slowdowns, in another enclosure, with the Macbook Air.- This enclosure, with either drive, worked fine connected to an older Macbook, both with USB2(!) and Firewire 800But this particular configuration does not work, maybe due to some incompatibility with the Oxford USB3 chipset? Don't have immediate access to another computer with USB3 support to try, may update this review when I get the chance. But clearly with the current Macbook Air it's no-go based on the above.Update 1: Same behavior with a Macbook Pro 15\" Retina tested today.Update 2: No problem with a different USB3 enclosure (& different chipset), same drives, even using Oyen's conveniently shorter USB3 cable. (If you're interested:Sabrent USB 3.0 To 2.5-Inch Sata Aluminum Hard Drive Enclosure Case)P.S.: In case your laptop has only 2 USB ports on opposing sides, you may need an extension for the 2nd power-only connector, the shortest possible solution being a right/left angle one (ex.:HDE USB 3.0 Right Angle Male to Female Cable) I picked this one because it's fully USB3 compliant and can be used for data as well if needed, but cheaper alternatives are available.

I realize it's to ensure the iPad is completely covered but coupled with the snugness of the case, the iPad is awkward to remove.  I have to pinch the top with a vice-like grip and exert a little force when I pull to remove it.  The case is basically neoprene with soft patent leather finish attached.  It's a lot softer and less rigid than the pictures portray.  Despite the rigid plastic screen protector (and by rigid, I mean about as thick/sturdy as the material used in e-collars for dogs), it just doesn't feel like it'll offer much protection if your iPad is dropped, struck sharply, or sat on.

{"title": "Great picture, but old tech w/ burn in!", "body": "I was in the market for a new TV.  I wanted the best picture possible (without spending $6,000 on a new 4K TV set) for a 65\".  Unfortunately, I still paid almost full retail for this one as I was waiting for it to come out.  With such rave reviews from both experts and customers alike for the prior year model, this was sure to be even better.  I have always been apprehensive of buying a plasma as I was afraid of burn it.  I was assured that it is likely not to happen with this set as plasma has come such a long way over the years.  My prior TV was a Samsung LED that is about 7 years old.  I always loved the picture on that TV, but the blacks were not dark enough.So, after much research and waiting, I purchased this set (from a local retail store, not Amazon as they matched the pricing).  The TV itself is beautiful and well designed.  I like the look of it on the wall even when it is off.  I won't get into the technical aspects, and as you can read from all the other reviews on here, the picture is amazing.  However, I cannot recommend this set and do wish that I had just waited for a 4K or even OLED which should surface if a short while.  I am just going to share my personal experience with the set and hope that it helps others in their decision.The reason for the 3 star rating is as follows:Loss of one star for burn in.  I had the set only 2 months when I noticed a faint logo in the bottom right corner.  My wife likes to watch the channel Investigation Discovery and has it on this channel frequently.  They have a rather bright \"ID\" logo in the lower right corner, as do most channels these days.  Well, after only 2 months, it is now permanently burned into the screen.  Yes, the TV has a 'screen wipe' function which I use regularly to prevent this from happening, but it does not seem to help.  I find it very sad that my new $3,500 TV is already ruined by burn in, and as we all know, mfg warranty does not cover this.Loss of another star for wireless connectivity.  I enjoy Netflix quite often and was excited to have a TV that has this built in.  I usually use my PS3 to do Netflix and it is set up on my same wireless network.  Unfortunately, without fail, the TV disconnects from the wireless network within about 15-20 minutes of starting Netflix.  It doesn't just disconnect and reconnect either; I have to go back into the settings and input the network security code each time it does this.  I have since just gone back to using my PS3 for Netflix as it works without fail.Also, I know that people have listed that they don't like the sound.  I can't comment on this as I do not use the TV speakers at all and listen through my home theater system.  I can't imagine that someone would actually use the TV speakers on a set like this without a home theater.  But what can you expect from such small speakers on any TV?One last thing that people seem to dislike about this TV is the fan noise.  For me, I can only hear it when the sound is off.  If you have any sound at all, you can't hear the fan noise in my opinion.Anyway, I hope that this review helps you if you are looking at this set.  Again, nice TV, but I would wait if you can.  Plasma is just old tech and will likely not be around in a few short years.*** UPDATE 10/6 ***I have submitted 2 photos at the request of others on this site showing the burn in.  Please note that my wife has completely stopped watching the ID channel since my last review as I was so upset with the burn in.  I have gone so far as to run the screen wipe all night long to see if that would help as well.  Unfortunately, the burn in is still there.  I apologize for the poor photos, as there is quite a bit of glare on the screen, but you can still see what I am talking about.  The photo taken of the ID channel on was the first time it was turned on that channel since the last review, and I simply did it so you can see better where to look on the other photo.  When you look in the lower right corner, you will see a light area (glare), but look at the top left corner of that bright area and you will see a darker ID logo on the screen.To reply to a couple of comments related to my post, first let me say that this has not discouraged me from buying a Panasonic product as I do not feel that they are the issue.  The issue I have is the burn in.  That is related to the plasma technology used for this television type.  I don't feel that it would have been any different with any other brand.  Second, I am glad to post any more photos if you guys want them.  I know that these are not the best, but I wanted to get something up for you all to see.  As I stated, I post reviews to help others make an informed decision regarding a product, not bash a product (unless warranted).  I truly hope that my review has helped others in their TV buying experience and research.  Thank you all for reading my review!  Please keep the comments coming!", "rating": "mixed"}

That is pretty darn fast.I then charged my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; (Previous Model) which has a 4,400 MAH battery and started the charge at 35% battery left on the Fire and the pack went dead at 79% which is 1,540 MAH's.

{"title": "Good but not without flaws", "body": "Linksys WVC80N cam review:Positives:Supports 640x480 resolution at up to 30FPS. Don't buy an ip cam that doesn't support 640x480 (i.e. some of the Panasonic ones)The low light level performance is good. This cam claims to have a better CMOS sensor that the previous model but it's still not all that great in low light (if you want good images in low light you need an IP cam with a CCD sensor but this adds cost and complexity). This is not a Day/Night cam that has infrared LEDs that provide illumination in completely dark areas. (You need to have some level of lighting, and the more the better). Still, I think it's better in low light that some other IP cams.Cam supports wired Ethernet AND 802.11n (Draft) WiFi. 802.11n is better for supporting multiple cameras (but see negative below).Works very well with (3rd party) BlueIris softwareThe camera can time stamp the video with the current time/date. It can also display any text on the video (such as location etc) that you enter)The user manual PDF is very well written and goes into technical details that other manufacturers leave out (such as CGI commands to control the camera without using the web interface).Very reliable, especially with a wired connection. I run these 24/7 without having to periodically reset cams, which is a problem that seems to plague other IP cams.Unlike some other cams this one has an integrated infrared lens filter, which means that outdoor images will have correct colors.The status page indicates the current interface in use (WiFi or Ethernet). Some other cams do not indicate what the current interface is, and this is useful info for troubleshooting/diagnostics.Negatives:There does not seem to be a way to manually focus the camera lens. If you have stuff going on more than a few feet away you will not see details!The power adapter cord is way too short! The cord SHOULD be at least 10-12 feet long. I never understand why manufacturers always give you a short cord - do they feel that you always have a power outlet where you want to place a cam?I don't like the mounting bracket. Two screws (NOT INCLUDED - why?!) must first be screwed into the mounting surface and the mounting bracket slides into the screws and held by friction or gravity (depending on mounting position). This is in contrast to other cam mounts which must be screwed down and are unremovable without tools (this one isn't). In addition it is too easy for anyone to move the cam's position by hand. Also the mount makes the cam stand out more (more noticeable). There should be a cardboard template included to make it easier to drill the mounting holes for the screws (they must be spaced apart correctly otherwise the bracket will not fit). Also the design of the mount makes it impossible for the cam to mount against a vertical surface (side of bookshelf) and show a straight level display, because the side of the cam bumps into the base of the mount.This cam is labeled as using draft 802.11n technology and features 1 internal antenna (according to the datasheet). For maximum range and speed 802.11n uses MIMO which requires multiple antennas. This may explain why the range may not be as good as it could be.The cam's web interface should feature a WiFi scan feature which also displays all detected SSIDs, channel # and % signal level (so you can get an idea of signal strength and channels in use by other routers). Trendnet WiFi IP cams have this feature and it's a VERY useful one. It's disappointing that other manufacturers don't include this feature.The image options web page allows brightness/sharpness to be set, but it doesn't display the image at the same time so you can observe changes.The webpage \"Live Video\" displays video only using MJPEG, not MPEG. Other cameras (such as Trendnet) allow selection of video type. This does not mean that the camera only supports MJPEG but that's all you can get via the default webpage).The camera is supposed to get current time by NTP protocol but this seems to be broken - the cam's status log indicates \"NTP: Failed to synchronize data & time with the NTP server\". Unlike other cams you cannot change the NTP server and it is not even displayed so I have no idea what the problem is. This could be a big deal if you are recording to a Samba server as the time&dates; will be wrong!Comments on other reviewer's problems:\"Range problems\" - WiFi connections are tricky things, in that there are many factors to consider. Interference from other routers, distance/positioning of both router/cams, router firmware, cam firmware, MIMO capabilities of both, type of walls between router & cam etc. The only constant to reliable working WiFi is experimentation - sometimes another router or cam will work better in a given situation. Wired Ethernet gives the most reliable results but isn't always convenient. If the web interface displayed signal levels it would be easier to troubleshoot wireless problems. Also this camera should have 2 antennas for MIMO support.Overall I think this is a decent camera for the price (less than one one five). However many improvements that I've listed can be made via firmware so hopefully this camera will be improved. And how about a True 802.11n MIMO version of this camera?OCT2011 UPDATE: Just wanted to say a few more things. With regards to reliability these cams are rock solid with a WIRED connection. With a WiFi connection there have been a few times that the WiFi has \"locked up\" and the cam needed to be power reset. This seems to be related to distance from the router and I have seen it on the cams using WiFi that are located furthest. Like I mentioned above it's unfortunate that there is no sort of site survey that displays signal strength etc so you could troubleshoot this.

{"title": "Warning!", "body": "This dock requires HDTV, at minimum 720P resolution. It does not work on regular TV.Like all other Kodak docks, it requires the custom camera insert included with your camera. If you have more than one dock, contact Kodak about getting extras. Using the dock without the adapter plate can cause damage to your camera, the dock, or both.It does not connect to a PC. You need a different dock, printer dock, or a memory card reader for that.Check camera compatibility before use.It is not compatible with CX, DX, or and most LS, model cameras at all.Some supported cameras DO NOT output in HD quality for picture or video.It will not play video at all from many models of camera, even when you use the memory card directly in the dock.The product strikes me as something Kodak stopped in the middle of development. It will not save many users from needing multiple memory cards or a laptop while traveling. The fact it only works with an HDTV makes it fairly useless for travel anyway unless you manage to find a hotel that has the required TV and allows you to mess with it.", "rating": "mixed"}

You are given the option to wall mount with brackets or if you would prefer there is an included stand which allows you to balance the speaker wherever you wish to place it. Speaker level connections use clips, not banana plugs.Will this unit be preferred amongst home theater enthusiasts? Most definitely not. What this center channel does bring you is a decent sound in a very small speaker(And at a good price, especially when coupled with one of polk's RM packages). Those looking to add a HT setup to their house will be very pleased with this center. Even if you wish to upgrade over a built-in TV speaker this center channel would be more than adequate. An average speaker overall, but probably much better than the similarly priced competition(if you buy in package).", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Strange but Beautiful Product", "body": "I love the built in stand and the front facing speakers its a really pretty product and even comfortable to hold while in bed or sitting in a chair. I also love that when you put your sd card in there itgives you this scrolling horizontal user interface that has each video on the card and you can scroll through them and pick what your looking to watch. There is also a 5 or 10 second quick foward or reverse button on the video player so if you miss something you don't have to scroll to the spot with your finger which is hard to pinpoint on a touchscreen you just press either of the buttons. Your not going to be using this tablet to type much on, the keyboard is a bit wide for me and thin horizontally for me, your going to be missing your keys, also the browser seems to be a different version than the new updated android browser and it wouldn't let me install chrome browser from the google play store. I also noticed that the browser would not let me click some videos on a website I visit but since the website has an app I was able to use that instead. The battery runs out QUICKLY, as for the charger this comes with you'd think they'd give you a longer cord on the adapter for something that's going to live plugged in all the time well its very short but I used my phone charger cord to charge this which is longer, now the bottom of the device says to only use the supplied charger but I had it plugged in overnight and everything seems to be fine. Of course they are both the same volts, amps and watts otherwise you might have some big issues so proceed at your own risk. So there's good and bad in this, your not going to get a crystal clear screen like an iPad but its cute for a kitchen or to Skype on which is built in and easy to use. The 7 inch screen is a bit small forget or reading but light reading and watching videos is ok, I think this is best for watching videos you have saved on an sd card. I hear some people say the battery only lasts one hour but so far I believe mine has lasted 2 or more but I didn't time it. You can just keep it plugged in . So good and bad things on this tablet if you get it for a good price it looks nice on your desk. One more thing the touchscreen is pressure sensitive not capacitive like an iPad so you have to press on the screen to get it to recognize your touch, which most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference except on this tablet its surprisingly very sensitive for a pressure sensitive screen as I tried to scroll videos on youtube it just picked up my scrolling as a touch and starts loading videos you didn't click on so that stinks, I noticed that I used a stylus from my phone and it worked great on this tablet and took care of that problem but I don't like using the stylus to much.

A down side: the remote \"input\" button also seems to have crapped out so we have to manually hit the button on the back if we want to play music though the headphone input jack.*It has/had very good sound.  Also it has a small footprint / doesn't take up a whole lot of space.  It puts out some good volume and doesn't struggle to fill the room.  It was great for keeping the iPads charged up and for listening to music from pandora, etc.*Didn't like that it would automatically start playing music from either iPad as soon as we placed it on the connector. (no longer a problem...)*Remote design isn't the best (vol control vs next track should be switched - my opinion).*For all the issues I'm still considering buying another if I find it for the right price.  It was cheap the first time and for the sound quality, it was worth it to us as it fit our sound/space needs/requirements.  That said, I wouldn't really recommend it due to its lack of durability and odd bugs associated with volume control (as noted in other reviews).  We'll keep using our broken one as an auxiliary speaker until Santa finds and brings a replacement.3 stars", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Reasonable, Budget Telephoto", "body": "I bought this lens because it is the only telephoto lens currently available for the micro43 system.  My first impressions follow:Build Quality is what you'd expect from a kit lens.  It is very \"plastic-y\" and doesn't really inspire the user with confidence.  Perhaps more disconcerting is the fact that you can \"feel\" the components inside the lens move around.  I read on the dpreview forums that this is to be expected.I was also less than impressed with the Optical Image Stabilization of this lens.  Having used/owned various Canon IS lenses in the past, I was expecting 3-4 stops of additional hand-holding ability.  However, I've found that I've had consistently poor results with the OIS beyond 2 stops.  It is better than nothing (particularly since this lens is so cheap) but not great.The IQ is quite decent.  It has little to no distortion (and it is very good at the wide end) but this may have to do with the fact that Panasonic corrects distortion from their lenses inside the camera.  Pictures at the telephoto end are a bit soft but I'm probably being unfair (I've been comparing in my mind to Canon's fantastic 70-200 f/4 IS which costs 3 times more).The one extremely bright spot for this lens is its relative size.  For an equivalent focal length of 90-400, there isn't another lens on the market that can compare to this lens' size.  It is no bigger than the standard zoom kit lenses that you get with other systems.  Micro43 has a bright future if they can continue to make such small lenses while improving build quality.", "rating": "mixed"}

If you use the other app you have to go through the laborious process of setting up port forwarding etc. The purpose of paying extra for a plug&play camera was so I wouldn't have to do that. I can't believe they would not update their own app to enable this function.  My experience with calling technical support was more positive than several of the other reviewers. I called tech support 4 times, for various issues, and each time I waited less than 5 minutes to talk to a tech support person. My experience with sales was a bit problematic.

{"title": "Great for Amazon fans. Does not replace a computer.", "body": "1st, I have the Kindle Fire HD 7\" with 32 GB of storage and ads enabled.If you are a book junkie, news junkie, or movie buff like me, then you will love the Kindle. You can carry around in your hand a whole library of large or small books and read them at your leisure, which can be just about anywhere. I think that aspect of it is great.There are also all kinds of games for it. I like a handful of the basic time-wasters, but otherwise I stay away from them.It does not have the basic card reader. It is designed with the idea that all of your storage will be on Amazon's Cloud Storage. Amazon gives you unlimited storage for the materials which you purchase from them, plus 5 GB for personal data. You can't transfer images from your favorite camera onto it, unless it has built-in WiFi (maybe). The Kindle is designed to rely only on it's built-in camera. I don't consider the built-in camera to be real great. Plus I consider the built-in camera awkward to use. It seems like the main idea of it is to take pictures of the user. Use with video calls and video conferencing would be ideal for it.Unlike the Netbooks, which were popular a couple of years ago, this tablet does not replace a computer in any sense of the word. You will still need a computer in addition to this tablet.Also, while I am on computer issues, Amazon's instructions say that this table will connect to any computer. This idea does not seem to be true with some computers and operating systems. My computer would be an example. The Kindle transfer system relies on the newest version of the Windows Media Player. I am running Windows 7-64 Premium on a 1 year old Toshiba. It has an AMD 64 bit processor and the 64 bit version of Windows 7. (Amazon and Microsoft both indicate that I am a minority with this choice.) I have the Windows Media Player on my computer. However, Microsoft gives me the message that the newest version of their Media Player will NOT run on my system. Apparently, my version of Windows Media Player is upgraded as far as Microsoft is going to upgrade it. (I never use it anyway.) It also appears that Kindle can not transfer files to my computer without the newest version. To get files from one computer to the other, it seems that I will have to email them to myself. (This is going to be a pain.)WiFi connections are problematic. That said, the Kindle version seems to be more problematic then most. I travel all over the USA. If you are in an area where there is a lot of WiFi routers, then the Kindle seems to get confused and refuses to work. Or you start running into security issues with everyone.I mentioned before that I am a movie buff. There is not room on it's internal storage to download a bunch of movies to it, and there is no external storage except on Amazon. I have even tried attaching an adapter and card reader card to it. This idea didn't work. Kindle won't recognize the card.I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard which works fine with it. But while I can pair up my computer to the Kindle with a Bluetooth connection, I still can not transfer files to/from my computer to the Kindle using it. (Don't know why, yet.)One thing that I have noticed is that this is a great idea to increase Amazon's business. I have purchased several apps and books from Amazon for it. Books are usually a lot cheaper to buy for use on Kindle. Apps are usually very cheap. And it is really nice to have a whole library to read at any given point where I have extra time. The built-in reader which reads books back to you is another great feature. I like have it read to me while I sit back and relax. (I am reminded of teachers asking me in high school if I was reading with my eyes closed and my head laying on the books.)Another issue that I have run into is the Kindle headphone-speaker plug. I am working trying to find out what works and what doesn't work with it. I have one set of headphones which will work with it, and they sound great. But most headphones and speakers won't work with it. The receiver socket of the plug-in area is recessed, and only a plug with an indented collar will make a connection. Standard speakers and headphones for other devices don't seem to work with it since their connecting plugs don't slide inside the socket far enough.The sound from the Kindle is great. The video is great. It is easy to read. There is a ton of things that you could do with it.In short, the Kindle is a great idea. But it still needs work.Update: Sept 18, 2013I have ordered many things from Amazon using my Kindle Fire HD.But it hit me that not all of the items available from Amazon will show up on the Kindle when browsing and placing orders. An example would be a jacket that I just received. I am a big person, and need big clothes. I ordered the largest size of a jacket that I liked using my Kindle Fire HD. It barely fits me. I looked at the jacket that I ordered on my home computer and saw that Amazon offers the jacket the next 2 sizes larger, and in additional colors. The additional larger sizes and colors where not showing on my Kindle when I placed the order.As I said before, the Kindle fine for reading books, magazines, and for a person's personal entertainment. In fact, it is great for that. But it does not replace a computer.", "rating": "mixed"}

The only customization you can do is a voice pack upgrade ($$) or a themed 'dashboard' ($$ - Starwars, Spongebob, and Dora the illegal alien).  You CAN download a voice editor to re-record the prompts.. but not the street names.  You can also download vehicle icons, but not edit any. There are the same basic mods you could do to the 1300.The display is bright, the signal acquisition is QUICK but I still notice the map 'jumping' when driving straight.  Its annoying.  The mount is basically the same and it did include a USB cable that will charge the unit if plugged in to a powered USB port.  Also a car charger.I didn't see a way to add a custom boot image, nor assign an image to a saved address.  It might be in there.. I haven't pressed every button yet.

{"title": "Pretty good (as a keyboard), but not as a cover.", "body": "I am annoyed when a product comes without instructions so, right off the bat, we got off to a bad start. Installation isn't exactly 'plug and play' as you might expect in a product without instructions and I had never before installed hardware to the ipad. There is a slip of paper that tells you to go to a website (or scan a QR code) to get the manual. When I did so, I couldn't spot any product that began with \"Hard shell\" and the search function told me that there was no manual for such a product. I kept doing the same thing over and over and (finally!) it found the manual. For those of you who might be having the same problem, here is the link:[...]Once you know the process, installation (and 'pairing') is a breeze. The i-pad fits easily into the groove, the plastic stand that pops up holds it at the perfect angle for desk viewing at either orientation. It removes and slides in without effort.I am writing this review on the keyboard and I do like not having to use the tapping i-pad keyboard. I am always making mistakes, either adding extra letters or not having letters register. This is pretty close to typing with an actual keyboard. I love that I have arrow keys and a caps lock, I hate that the shift key on the right is a bit far and I wish it had a \"delete\" key so I could delete left to right instead of always right to left, but those are minor problems.  Of course, the keys are a little closer together than they would be on a regular keyboard, but you easily adjust to touch typing. Good responsive keys, neither requiring too much pressure nor overly sensitive. It also has tab, Fn, control, alt/option, and command/control.  Best of all, you don't have to keep switching between the letters keyboard and the number/symbols keyboard all the time.  Despite the fact that the i-pad weighs much more than the keyboard, the keyboard lays flat on the desk regardless of orientation. Since the non-slip buttons are only on the four corners, the smooth plastic surface slides off your lap and I don't feel comfortable using it that way, particularly in portrait orientation. I don't mind because I got it to work on a desk, but it might be a consideration for you. On the whole, the KEYBOARD part of the product rates pretty highly.My main complaint is that the I pad is hard to remove once you are no longer using the keyboard and want to use it as an i-pad cover, it is really awkward. It is difficult to snap on, and downright scary to snap off. I am concerned that I will damage the i-pad yanking so hard.  According to the online manual, there is supposed to be a \"screen protector\"included with the keyboard. I didn't get that (and I've carefully checked all the packing materials) but I doubt that this would make a difference in the easy of removal, and I'm wondering if, without it, the screen is vulnerable--maybe I'll insert a sheet of paper or something.Since I carry my i-pad in my purse I will continue to use the apple plastic cover as a cover. It is thin, doesn't take up as much room, and protects my i-pad well. I will  use the keyboard at home for writing e-mails (and reviews). I confess that this was always my intention, but it might have been nice to, occasionally, have the option of taking the keyboard along. After my struggles to get the i-pad to come apart from the keyboard cover, I have given up that idea.So, if this was only a 'keyboard' I would have given it a 5, but since it is also supposed to function as a 'cover' I've had to remove a couple of stars because it is not something I would ever choose to use as a cover.", "rating": "mixed"}

In fact, I was so impressed with the firmware that I'd rate it right up there with Open-WRT in terms of feature richness that an advanced home user could want.If there is anything to complain about, the packet inspection slows this router down noticeably, more so than a Cisco SOHO router would. Of course, it's also half the price of one of those, but the lack of performance makes the savings more of a hassle than it is likely worth.Wireless offers stable connections with no drop-outs. The range is lacking, however. My 4 year old wireless-N router covers almost twice the area that this D-Link router does. That's a shame, because the stable operation could have made this a real winner.Other than the feature-rich firmware and stability, this router is barely average in actual performance, if not slightly below average.

I think the point of the earbuds is just to keep them in place - I believe sound is coming from the entire circular portion.The earbuds just rest on one of the curves of my ear rather than over my ear canal. Hence, they do legitimately stay on my ears, even during movement or while being upside down, but they're simply not comfortable. They don't hurt, but they just never feel secure even if they don't fall off. One tug of the cord downward and the left side will pretty easily slide right off, hence the clip on the cord. On the right side ear, the plastic part would never rest behind my ear like normal behind-the-head headphones, which contributed to them not feeling secure. Additionally, if the earbud thing doesn't rest over your inner ear then the sound will be quieter than it would be with normal over-the-ear headphones.I ended up having to give these away after a few days of usage because I just couldn't get used to them.

{"title": "A good, basic GPS that needs a significant price cut.", "body": "I've reviewed other Garmin GPS units; please see my other reviews for comparisons. Also, my star rating is largely dependent upon price. See the last couple paragraphs here for details.This is one of the lowest-end GPS units available from Garmin, though at the time of this writing the Garmin \"i\" series (i2, i3, and i5) has been officially discontinued. (Note: When I refer to the \"i3\" in this review the same information applies to the i2 and i5 unless otherwise noted.) Still, this is a decent enough inexpensive GPS, particularly if you shop around for a bargain. The three \"i\" series Garmins are identical but for basic features. The i2 has a monochrome screen and no preloaded maps. The i3 has a color screen but is otherwise identical to the i2. The i5 is identical to the i3 but contains preloaded maps.Included in the box is the GPS itself, a 128MB MicroSD memory card, the MapSource DVD (version 8) containing maps of the United States and surrounding areas, a suction cup mount, 12 volt power adapter cable (for your car's cigarette lighter), an adhesive dashboard disk, a USB cable (A to mini), and a reference guide and some other bits of paper.Physically, the GPS is downright puny. Occupying about as much volume as a tennis ball, the i3 looks like a tiny original iMac computer. The face has a clickable scroll wheel, like pretty much any computer mouse today, and operates in the same way. This is your primary interface for the GPS. Flanked on either side of the scroll wheel is a \"back\" button on the left and the power button on the right. The right side of the unit has a mini USB port, slot for the MicroSD card, and a cover for the battery compartment (it takes two AA batteries, not included). The single speaker is on the bottom.Initial setup is easy. Install batteries, make sure the MicroSD card is installed, and turn it on. Install the software on your PC (alas, full Macintosh support is STILL not available from Garmin) and plug in the USB cable when prompted. The first thing you'll need to do is download maps into your GPS. The 128MB card is really pathetic, but I was able to fit three or four of the smaller northeastern states into it. I found a cheap 2GB card which allowed me to put all of the maps on it, so I recommend anyone who buys an i2 or i3 to do likewise. Once the maps are installed you may also want to run Garmin's online updater which will update the system in your GPS. Mine came with the most up-to-date system but had a few other updates, mainly for the different voices, which took about 15 minutes to download and install.Once you're done you can unplug the Garmin and start driving. Because the i3 uses batteries you can either keep using batteries and replace them (or use rechargeables) when they're dead, or you can use the included power adapter for your car's cigarette lighter. The i3 draws power through the USB port so in a pinch you could even power it off your computer's USB port. If you use rechargeable batteries, the i3 will not charge them when connected to a tethered power source.I've previously used other Garmins (2820, c330, c550, and Nuvi 310) so I was expecting much the same interface. I was right, but I was also wrong too. The i3's biggest drawback is a lack of touchscreen; all selections go through the click wheel. You can think of it sort of like moving through an iPod. You scroll to the next menu, click to select, scroll to the item, and click to select. You use the \"back\" button to back up one menu, like the MENU button on an iPod. It's a simple enough navigation system which won't cause any difficulty for most people, but at times it can be laborious.The real effort comes when it's time to put in an address. Imagine having to \"type\" your address on an iPod. Scroll to select a letter, click, scroll to the next letter, click, etc until you're done. It works but it's clunky. To Garmin's credit they did a sort of \"auto-complete\" with this process; as you enter letters (and numbers) the Garmin displays a list of possible matches on the side. At any time during the text entry process you can stop entering text and move to that list of matches. Then you just scroll to the one you want and select it. There's some delay involved in this process, particularly if you don't enter a lot of characters and/or if the region you've selected has a lot of similarly-named streets or cities. Even so, it's usually still faster than typing in the whole name through the scroll wheel. Users of the i3 will definitely want to make use of the \"Favorites\" function to store commonly-used addresses.Once you've got the address in, the Garmin's navigation system takes over and it's quite nice. Being a low-end system you get no fancy features; you get no street name announcements, no traffic uplink, no Bluetooth, no MP3 playback, etc. It DOES give you voice prompts (e.g., \"turn left in 400 feet\"), automatic route recalculation in case you go off route, and route avoidance (you can tell it to avoid highways or toll roads, for example) which are all basic GPS features. Given that the i3 uses the same map data as the higher-end Garmin units, accuracy is very good.As a test I put the i3 next to my 2820 and entered the same destination into both, and as I expected both units gave me the same directions to my destination. I did notice two things in that test though. The first was that the i3 took significantly longer to pick up the satellites than my 2820. It took about 20-30 seconds for my 2820 to pick up satellites and begin calculations for the course, but it took nearly three minutes for the i3 to do the same thing. In fairness this may have been due to motion vs non-motion; I was parked while the 2820 was calculating but once it was ready to go I started driving. The i3 was still calculating while I was driving so that may have caused an increase in calculation time with the i3.The second thing I noticed was that the i3 got a little confused as to my current location than my 2820. While sitting at a traffic light surrounded by 5-6 story tall buildings my 2820 didn't even flinch, but the i3 would occasionally jump around and put the vehicle as much as a block and a half away from my actual location. Once I started moving, however, the i3 caught up fairly quickly. I am guessing that the satellite antenna isn't as sensitive in the i3 as the 2820 (which would also account for the longer delay in finding satellites).The biggest downside to the i3 is the quality of its screen. Like the StreetPilot c300 series (see my previous review of the c320) the i3 tends to wash out in even mild sunlight making visibility difficult at best. Worse, the i3's screen is highly reflective; it is impossible to read in bright sunlight due to the glare. Fortunately there's a great product called GlareStomper which adds a shade to the GPS unit that cuts the glare down to nothing. The i3's viewing angle is also far narrower than the c300 series. Having the c320 on the dashboard and angled towards the driver, the passenger can easily see the screen. Not so on the i3, where the screen gains a noticable blue cast as your viewing angle increases. If you're going to use the i3, make sure you can see it \"head-on\" or as close to it as possible.All that being said, let's summarize.GOOD: Inexpensive, particularly if you check out a certain auction web site for remanufactured units (and GlareStompers). Color screen (personally, I'd avoid the i2's black and white screen altogether). Good speaker volume. Accurate maps. Solid basic feature set. Battery power to take it with you if the need arises (e.g., if your car breaks down and you have to walk to the nearest service station). Small size makes it highly portable. Uses industry standard MicroSD cards.BAD: Terrible screen if you don't have a sun shade and/or if you're not looking at it head-on or as close to it as possible. Kludgey scroll wheel navigation system really makes you want a touch screen. Slower acquisition of satellite signals and route calculation. Batteries don't charge in the unit so you'll need to make sure you always have good batteries in it. Cheap 128MB MicroSD card is lame; Garmin should have AT LEAST a 256MB or 512MB card in there. Historically terrible customer support from Garmin, including a lack of promised Mac OS X support.Overall, the bad things don't really overwhelm the good things so I would judge it an \"okay\" basic GPS. HOWEVER, I have to give it low marks simply because of the cost issue. As of this writing Amazon is selling this unit for $270. At the same time Amazon is also selling the higher-end StreetPilot c340 for $60 *LESS* and the higher-end StreetPilot c330 (refurbished) for almost half the cost of the i3. Either of those c300 series units is far superior to the i3 in every measurable way, so why would anyone buy a less-capable i3 instead?In my case, the answer was simple: I didn't buy mine from Amazon. I bought a remanufactured unit through a very popular online auction site and paid less than $100. For that price, and likely not a penny more, the i3 is worthwhile. Otherwise, not so much. That being said, if you can buy this unit for under $100 then I give it four stars. Otherwise, I give it two stars. Therefore it balances out to three stars.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "difficult installation, but now it works", "body": "My network already included a TP-Link WL TL-WR841N 300Mbps Router, and one of their wireless adapters.  The install on those wasn't as simple as some reviewers apparently experienced, especially for the router.  But it was not too bad, given that the products are reasonably priced and seem to work very well.  So, I decided to get this AP, primarily for use with an older Compaq Presario 900 laptop running XP Home.When wired directly to the router, this Compaq's hard drive had been readily available on the network to my newer Lenovo wireless laptop.  However, when the wire was removed, and the old laptop connected to the router with the wireless adapter, the drive was no longer visible to the new laptop.  Since I mainly use the network for sharing an internet connection, with just occasional file-sharing needed between the laptops, I didn't want to experiment with various network changes to access the Presario's drive.  If it was visible when wired to the router (a configuration I couldn't keep), then I figured it should also work when wired to an AP running as a universal repeater.  This did turn out to be true, yet it was by no means an easy task to get it working.No problem getting the AP hooked up, turned on, and accessing the web-based configuration utility.  But, changes to various settings were required to get the AP connected to my network, and that's where the problems started.  Any time I tried to save changes, a message would appear about Incorrect Username or Password.  This didn't seem to make sense, because I was already logged in with the default user & pw, which are both \"admin\".  I went to the company web site and found there was newer firmware available, so I installed it, but this did not fix the problem.After awhile getting nowhere, I decided to switch from the old Compaq and try the setup on the Lenovo laptop.  At first, I wasn't even able to access the configuration utility from the Lenovo's browser.  I had changed the computer's IP address and DNS servers as required, but that alone didn't work.  I figured out that I also needed to pull up my list of wireless connections, and try connecting to the AP.  The configuration utility login finally appeared.  Once inside, I tested a bit and could tell that it wasn't having the same problems as when accessed from my older laptop.  This likely means you'll want a version of XP that's beyond SP1 before installing this or, like me, have a 2nd computer that's more up to date.  However, if that's true, I'm not sure why my old Compaq didn't have similar issues with the TP-Link router and adapter - it was only the AP's setup it couldn't handle.Next, I made the mistake of setting the unit up as a universal repeater before getting it connected to the router.  Once in repeater mode, it disappeared from my list of wireless connections, and I couldn't get back in to the configuration utility.  I found the reset button for factory default settings and pressed it for 5 seconds, thus eventually getting the AP back in the connection list, so I could login again.Then, you would think QSS would work between a router and AP made by the same company, but this just wasn't going to happen, whether pressing the buttons, starting QSS from the configuration utilities, or by the method of entering PIN numbers from either unit.  (QSS had previously worked fine between the router and adapter.)  Giving up on that, I went to the AP's security page, selected WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK, version Automatic, encryption AES, and entered the long PSK password that was assigned for the network when the router was installed.After saving the security settings, I was able to verify connection with the router, set up the AP as a wireless repeater, and also  change the setting for the AP to get a Dynamic IP (DHCP) from the router (so it's no longer the default 192.168.1.254).  Once configured, I went back and wired the old Compaq laptop to it, and it worked as originally intended.  The last step was to change my computer's network TCP/IP settings back to automatic assignment of IP and DNS.  Everything seems to be fine now.  I'm happy with how it turned out, but was frustrated enough with the setup that a couple of times I wondered if it might be easier to just send it back and try one from a different company.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Very pretty, but cramped.", "body": "This is certainly the most aesthetically pleasing case I've owned, and very well finished, but the cramped quarters when using a full size ATX board makes it difficult to give it a top rating.To get the motherboard in, ALL of the drive bays must be removed.  The only fan cooled drive carrier leaves the drives sticking pretty far into the case over the motherboard.  I had to make sure the SATA cables were attached to the motherboard before inserting the drive bay, since I would not have been able to get to them afterwards (in fact I started out that way and had to remove the drive bay, connect the cables to the motherboard, then replace the drive bay).  Getting the drive bays in was further complicated by the front panel cables, which had a tendency to get between the bays and the bottom of the case.  A hemostat would have helped, but I don't have one.Normally I have drive fans blowing in, but the cables behind the face-plate stuck out a little and rubbed on the in-blowing fan.  Turning it around, the fan mounting kept the panel cables at bay.I have a hard time understanding how effective the fan is, since there is no obvious place where the air is exhausted at the front of the case.  I have to assume blowing the air around the drives (recirculating) is better than nothing.  There was no way to mount the drives with sufficient space between them (in my opinion, at any rate), so the fan ends up being pretty important.Because of the cramped space for cables at the bottom of the case, I ended up turning the power supply around so the cables came out near the top instead.There was supposed to be space for a side fan that could blow into the case at about the same place that the processor was mounted.  Two problems: first, there's not enough space for an 80x80x25 fan (it bumps into the processor fan); second, there's no obvious way of mounting it, at least not without defacing the attractive mesh cover.  I ended opting to live without the extra fan, but that makes this the least-well-ventilated case I own.I read a fair amount of SilverStone's online information.  Apparently they're proud of cases that don't take up much space.  Good for them.  Bad for me.Up to this point, I have been able to reuse my cases as technology changes.  What I have in this case will stay in this case, since I don't look forward to wrestling with the case to change the motherboard.Not recommended, but it *is* really pretty.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "3 stars for the potential, but no more for what it does today", "body": "So far the Xbox One is OK but not a huge upgrade.  There isn't a great launch game, which is disappointing.  I downloaded a demo of the new Kinect Sports and it shows a lot of promise, but that game won't be out for a while.The kinect is much more accurate than the previous generation.  The Kinect Sports demo is a waverunner race, and you control your speed by opening or closing your right fist.  The kinect can actually detect the change!I wasn't expecting a lot out of Fighter Within, and although it isn't awesome it is better than I expected.  I can throw fast punches and it will recognize that (Wii and older kinect never would).  Kicks work well too.  I can reliably cover/block as well.  As I learn more advanced combos my opinion may go up as well.  It is quite a workout to play this one!Just Dance is OK, but I prefer the Dance Central interface.  I wish there was a new Dance Central out for the system, but there isn't yet.  JD is good enough that I will play it though.As a multimedia hub, Xbox One is a mixed bag as well.Netflix works much better on Xbox One than it did on 360.  The 360 always looked blurry to me, but the One looks nice and clear.  The PS3 always looked clear to me.  I will probably transition to using the One for watching Netflix rather than the PS3.Amazon Prime has done something with their sound, and on any of my systems I now hear music and background but the voices are very soft.  I have googled a little and see others with Dolby 5.1 having the same issue.  Supposedly if I switch to stereo audio I will hear everything OK, but I don't see going through settings menus to switch back-and-form just to watch something on Amazon Prime.The TV interface is geared around interfacing to a cable box and watching everything live.  Since that isn't how I watch TV anymore, I will probably just skip that altogether.  I have my Tivo feeding the Xbox right now, and I just don't see the point of going that route.  It doesn't even pass-through when the One is powered down, so I have to turn both my One and my Tivo on to watch anything I've recorded.The biggest advantage of the media hub in the One over the 360 is that the One is very quiet and the 360 is very noisy. I really do like that.So I guess overall I see potential but it isn't quite there yet.  I am hopeful the games will arrive, but I was hoping at least one would be here already.", "rating": "mixed"}

Looks good on a table as far as design. I switched from a wired Microsoft media pro keyboard and I got to really like all the extra buttons for controlling iTunes, zooming in and out of documents, volume control, programmable extra keys for launching various applications, etc. All of these are somewhat there in this wireless versionMost annoying features:The function keys and the escape key are waaay too small. They are hard to hit and even then they need to be depressed HARD otherwise it doesn't register. This is most annoying in every day use. Visually: the \"F1\" - \"F12\" function keys are printed on the keyboard are in dark blue on a black plastic so it's really hard to see. Not only that there is no identification for F13-F14-F15! Instead they printed all this annoying silly white icons on top of the keys for \"open\" \"undo\" copy\" \"paste\" etc. - and it should have been done the other way around. A lot of these are  Windows application functions and are totally irrelevant to Macs.On Macs there's no way to find out by looking at the keyboard if caps lock, num lock, and scroll lock are on. In order to save power, there are no lights for those locks. If you install the software (on Windows only!) if you press any of those buttons, a message on the screen will tell you the state of the locks, but after the message disappears, there's no way to tell. It's a power saving feature. Again, on Macs there is no way to tell what's on and what's NOT. Hit the keys to see the effect...

{"title": "Not one of my favorite kindle cases..", "body": "I recently purchases a Kindle Fire HD.  I have tested several cases.  WIth regards to the Timbuk2 Envelope Sleeve Case:The Good:  It is made out of a tough canvas material that I would expect to wear well.  The 'envelope' flap fastens very securely with two 1-inch+ pieces of velcro .  It looks relatively sleek and is discreet.  It has very nice stitching and very well constructed.The Bad:  Part of the reason I like to have a cover on my kindle is to protect it.  This sleeve lacks the rigidity of other cases.  Also I put a snap-on case on my kindle and tried to see if I could then slip it into the envelope- no go, too tight a squeeze.  Because the case lacks enough rigidity and padding in my opinion, the screen could sustain damage  just being carried in a laptop bag, etc.There are no openings for charging.  Basically, one has to take it out of the envelope to use or charge.  Other cases have openings for headphone jack and charging cable.  They are also making cases that stand up when folded a certain way.  Other covers out there allow you to protect your kindle while in use, charging and while in transport.If you like the look and are careful with your kindle, this might be great for you.  It is a well made case but just not good for someone like me who takes her kindle everywhere in a laptop bag.  For me, it seemed like more hassle combined with less protection.  It's better than nothing, don't get me wrong, but I think Kindle Fire HD users will find better cases out there with more protection, functionality and features.", "rating": "mixed"}

The picture did not blow me away, especially for standard definition channels. Few HDTVs will do a great job displaying standard def, but this TV is significantly worse than my Sony Bravia 32\" at carrying out this task. Faces would appear blotchy, similar to the computer art style known as \"cel shading.\"  The sound also left a lot to be desired. I wouldn't say it sounded \"tinny\" as others have commented, but I would use the words \"AM Radio\" to describe the Haier 32\" sound experience. You can turn up the volume and hear the audio fine, but it sounds flat.What led me to return the product was a loud audible buzz or hum that would emanate from the set when I plugged in a composite device. It didn't appear to be coming from the speakers, rather the set itself. The buzz would continue even when the volume was muted.Let the number of Amazon Warehouse used units give you pause before you purchase this off-brand set.

You don't have to be using the stupid touchpad on a laptop, and standard mice can get...not to sound unappreciative, but kinda boring. I shifted to a Logitech Trackman Marble, and it was really nice. But I saw this and I mean it's only 4 bucks...might as well try it.Pros:Offers something unique from a mouse or touchpad.Fairly high sensitivity; you don't have to throw the mouse to the left a million times to get the cursor to that side.The clickers (right, left) are very sensitive. You might not think of it but once you feel it, if they weren't, you'd have a hard time using them.The cord it attaches to the computer with isn't the regular plastic which can be bent a few times and start exposing wires, eventually failing. The cord is made of nylon string - you can't tie tight knots with it, but it is a lot more flexible than the plastic.Cons:The major problem with the mouse is that it doesn't feel really right. It doesn't want to go at the very tip of your finger, so it stays a little higher on the finger. This means you can't really have your finger on a flat hard surface without dragging your fingernail across the surface, and after a few minutes, they get sore.When clicking on whatever, since the mouse is fairly sensitive as it should be, your hands have a really hard time staying 100% still. So if you click, you often find that you drag whatever you clicked on somewhere, i.e a file gets dragged into the wrong folder accidentally.The mouse scroll thing, it's fairly low sensitivity, so you do somewhat have to scroll a bunch of times to get anywhere. Plus, the right/left click buttons are reasonably accessible, but the scroll bar is just at a really awkward position, making it basically useless.Overall, I think I'll be using this as either a backup, or as something to show off to friends, but when actually trying to get stuff done, I won't be using it. Very worth the 4 bucks though. I'd suggest it to friends, because if it caught on, people might start looking into how they can improve so that an even more functional version works.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Here's the scoop when using with Nikon's D5100", "body": "The eyecup is good and shields light nicely. To rotate into landscape mode is possible, but the rotation is quite stiff. I'm thinking a careful application of WD-40 with a cotton swab, being careful not to get the lubricant on the part of the unit that slides onto the correspondent mounting grooves on the camera, might be just the ticket.The articulated screen of the D5100 does, as mentioned in the product specs, collide with the eyecup, necessitating removal of the eyecup from the camera in order to swing the screen out or back in. While this is not such a big deal, my example broke as a result of this frequent on/off action. It still works-- just a little piece of plastic along one side broke, causing it to fit more loosely.Overall, I like the eyecup, especially if the WD-40 trick might work. Hang on a sec. I'll go try that now. I'll be right back.OK, the WD-40 helps, but the rubber is still a little resistant to turning. I rolled back the eyepiece, reversing its concavity to allow access to the ring about which it rotates and applied the WD-40 with a cotton swab. For me, it was still a little too sticky. I think I'll try some graphite lock lubricant and see if that works.UPDATE: After a few days, the WD-40 kicked in and the cup rotates pretty easily. Definitely an improvement over the way it came. I like the eyecup and use it all the time. It seals out ambient light and prevents distracting reflections in the viewfinder.Meanwhile, here's the executive summary:PROS:* Reasonably comfortable.* DOES rotate.* Screens out ambient light effectively.* InexpensiveCONS:* Rotates, but very stiffly. (see UPDATE above)* Collides with articulated screen on D5100 and similar models.* Better removed for storage and replaced with each camera use.* Construction is such that care is needed in removing and installing the eyecup.", "rating": "mixed"}

Second problem was, it was excruciatingly painful to navigate the interface, because there was significant \"button lag\", that is, between the time you press a button and the time the device does something and shows it on your TV set. A third problem, a minor one, was after I told the device to update its firmware, it just froze. Power buttons wouldn't revive it, so I had to unplug the power and replug it in, which did the trick!

Overall I give it 4 stars and 4 stars for each of the attributes. The only thing I don't like is the extra processes/memory usage the drivers use but it isn't too bad/noticeable since both my laptop and desktop are quad core and 4gb of memory; even when photoshop and chrome with a few tabs are open. I will try to upload a few sample pictures and/or videos of the tablet in use.After having it for a longer period of time and using it, it has actually degraded in performance, and now not worth the $80.

{"title": "Decent Side Bags But Clunky", "body": "I bought these for the extra space as I was running out of room in my Tamrac Expedition 3 (Model 5273).  Let me start buy saying that they are a pain to get onto the side panels of the bag and once they were on, they slide around a bit as they are not truly secured to the bag other than a velcro closure with two snap buttons that are a pain to close.  I love my camera bag but would caution that when buying these saddle bags, think about maybe purchasing a new bag all together since they are so expensive.Pros:  They store a lot of stuff.  I have about 8 filters in their original cases, a puffer (fully assembled) and some other odds and ends just in one of them.  Built very solidly.Cons:  I had to take one of them off my bag because they slide around and are a pain when trying to handle the bag. (i.e. when you can't set your bag down and want to retrieve something from the bag itself, they flop around a bit so makes this cumbersome task all the more so). Also, these are an expensive accessory when compared to just buying a new bag with more space.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Good Item But Needs More Reliable Rubber Feet", "body": "The Antec notebook cooler essentially fulfills its promise of pulling hot air from your laptop away from  the pc, where it can then be dispersed. My complaint is with two small but important factors:1) The cooler has four small rubber \"feet\" that sit between it and your computer. These tend to come off and, being small, ultimately get lost. I have found two of them and plugged them back in a number of times, but they continue to come off. The significance of this is that having that bit of space between your laptop and the cooler is important for pulling the air out. You don't want your laptop to sit immediately upon the cooler, yet this is what ends up happening as you lose first one then another of these four little rubber feet. (Antec could have at the least supplied an extra few spares, IMO).2) There is a \"high\" and \"low\" fan speed switch, but no \"off\" switch. This could be significant since computers vary from model to model as to whether or not USB power goes off when the computer is placed in \"standby\" mode. My old laptop would cut power to the USB's, so I had no issue there. With my new laptop, however, power is not cut, so I am left to unplug the USB every time, or else leave the cooler running constantly which doesn't seem a very good idea.On the plus side, the Antec does provide a pass-thru USB slot, which compensates for the USB port occupied by the device itself.Ultimately the Antec cooler is a decent product but one with a couple of shortcomings that could be significant.I know that the Targus model of cooler has gotten some bad press on here, and some of that is well deserved since they tend to last somewhere between 6 and 9 months. But, the little rubber feet do stay on them. Unfortunately, the Targus does not have an on/off switch either. I do think the rubber feet is an issue Antec should address. How hard can it be to design rubber feet that actually stay on (plug-in style on the Antec), or that are firmly glued on???", "rating": "mixed"}

Eventually the camera will shut off stating \"Change Battery Pack\", if you remove and re-insert the battery it works for a few more shots or a few more minutes of video.  The original Canon battery works fine without any of these glitches.  So I'm assuming that the problem is with the Lenmar battery.

{"title": "It is what it is", "body": "Disclaimer:  I do not own a Flip MinoHD or any other Flip device.  This review is based on a week's heavy use of an HD that I borrowed to take on vacation.It is stretching a point to call this an HD camera as the video it produces scarcely resembles anything that consumers have learned to expect when the letters HD are involved.  As might be expected from the nature of the sensor used in the camera, images are grainy and focus is vague--just what one would anticipate from a fixed focus lens.  It reminds me of the images that used to be produced by 8mm consumer film cameras a couple of generations ago.Low light sensitivity is surprisingly good although white balance pretty much goes away and colors are shifted toward blue.Audio quality is likewise surprisingly good although the device suffers the usual problems of camera-mounted microphones.  That is to say that it faithfully reproduces every movement of your fingers on the camera, not to mention your inadvertently mumbled, \"Hold still, dammit,\"  The apparent lack of effective AGC means that if you turn up the playback volume loud enough to hear gramma's quavering thanks for such a wonderful 90th birthday party and then someone next to the camera speaks in a normal voice you'll get bounced out of your chair.Frame rate, either of the recording or the playback software is erratic.  Sometimes the video is quite smooth and sometimes it has a Keystone Cops jerkiness to it.  This was noticeable even when playing the video on a pretty powerful graphics PC and is most apparent during fast pans.  Of course, panning is one of those things that ought to be avoided by home videographers but...Ergonomically, the Flip is first rate.  Controls are simple, logical, intuitive, and they just work.  Build quality, at least on the outside, is excellent though I share with others a measure of befuddlement over the choice of piano black unless Flip assumes that owners are interested in collecting not just videos but fingerprints.I found the limited battery endurance an issue in a vacation setting where I was away from my hotel from morning to night.  For more typical home use (drag it out for Junior's christening party; film the kids making the first snowman of the year) it probably is just fine.I had no problems with the PC software though I understand some Mac owners are having indigestion.Bottom line?  This is a nice looking, easy to use video camera, stripped to its bare essentials, capable to capturing very mediocre images.  It is inexpensive and readily accessible to both your 12 year old granddaughter and your 80 year old palsied uncle.And therein lies its brilliance and the reason for its stunning success.  John and Mary Lunchbucket have never demanded excellence in either video or still photography.  They don't want on-screen menus that are six levels deep or handfuls of accessories and add-ons certain to be lost when needed.  They don't want to be confronted with an 85 page on-line user's manual.  What they want, for the most part, is easy access to memories.  This is exactly what the Flip provides.  It is a niche product with a very large niche.  It fills that niche well.As an absolute video recorder...one star.As a stroke of marketing genius...five stars.If it suits you, go for it.", "rating": "mixed"}

In theory the cable will disconnect near the headphones if the cable gets caught, \"a great feature for active users.\"  I'm probably less active than most, yet somehow I damaged the cable fairly quickly in spite of the connection near the headphones, or possibly because of it.  I don't take them out running or biking, so they're used around the house as I'm reading or washing dishes or on the NordicTrack.The damage is in the short wire near the headphones, not the long one.  I've replaced the long cable and that doesn't fix the problem.  If I'm sitting perfectly still and I can hold the wire in just the right position, I get left and right sound.  If I move or even sneeze, the left channel cuts out and I get to fight with the wire until it connects again.The sound is wonderful, but the inconvenience of using these headphones keeps me from using them most of the time.

{"title": "OK TV", "body": "It is a nice TV.  The picture quality out of the box is stunning when it is on a TV channel that is broadcasting a high quality HD signal.So why only 3 stars from me?1) Cost.  TV's like this one cost about twice as much as they should (compared to the last TV you bought).  Based on cost, they're all a 3/5 in my book.2) Setup.  The TV I bought had trouble initially detecting the TV cable signal during \"Plug & Play\" start up.  The cable signal worked perfectly on my old TV and on a smaller Samsung I own.  It worked eventually.  When I Googled \"Samsung Weak Cable Signal\" there was no shortage of items available for viewing.3) Sound Quality.  Sound quality is very basic and unimpressive.  As picture quality on all TV's has improved significantly over the years, sound quality hasn't.4) Features.  One feature of this TV is a scanning function of the ambient light in the room.  The problem is, that \"feature\" blocks the signal from the remote control for my BOSE system.  This means that every time I turn on my TV I have to use one remote for channel changing and a different remote for volume control for about the first 5-10 minutes.  I'm unable to completely disable that function on the TV and so will have to live with it.  Not good.5) WiFi Capability.  For about $50-$60 you can buy a Samsung dongle and plug it in to this TV making it accessible on your home wifi network.  I did so and can tell you it works.  The problem is that there is no benefit in doing so.  Save your money.  If you want to see your kids pictures on the TV you can use a USB drive.  If you want to watch movies from Netflix etc, the Samsung dongle won't do it for you.  I returned the dongle and bought an Apple TV puck.  Very nice.6) Documentation.  When I was trying to get the wifi dongle to work the TV manual explained I needed to download \"PC Share Manager\" software from the Samsung website.  A trip to their website yielded a completely different software download called \"AllShare\".  I presume it is a renamed update for the software but am not sure.  I ended up not installing either.7) Software.  There are a few annoying things.  For example, I have my Apple TV plugged into HDMI port 1.  On the menu screen showing sources I wish it could set it up to say \"Apple TV\" so that members of my family don't have to remember that I happened to plug it in to port 1.Bottom Line:Nice basic modern TV.

Also, a little known fact, at least for photoshop you can make the RAW editor open any type of image file, and while it's still not RAW, the tools are less destructive than most others.I tried another reviewer's suggestion of taking off the end and scanning against a white monitor (I found lace curtains on a sunny day worked best) and while it helped, I still was not totally satisfied with the results.OVERALLIf you are just looking for a cheap way to scan old family photos, you will probably be satisfied with the results after about 10 minutes of editing on each file and if that is your purpose, go ahead and get this copier. If, however, you are like me and you pour over each negative/slide with a loupe to catch each detail and tone...well I'm not sure you're going to be satisfied. I would probably have given this item 3.5 stars if it were allowed, but it definitely isn't a 4 star product for me.", "rating": "mixed"}

Unless you have a second computer connected to the internet (to find out what the error code means), you will be up a creek without a paddle. Why? Because the disk that comes with the MOBO is worthless for finding the error code. Actually, IMO the disk is worthless since I have not used it since the abortive attempt to find the error code.After changing the BIOS to boot from the disk (it took a couple of tries to figure out how to change the value since positioning the cursor on the desired setting and pressing the enter key doesn't change anything), it still failed to boot -- with NO error message that was visible.So, after disconnecting everything except for the RAM, CPU, fans, boot drive, and Video card, tried again.

{"title": "Almost great, but just good.", "body": "First let me say this is really a 3.5 star review.The unit came packaged securely without the bank vault like plastic clam that takes five minutes to break into using everything from a pair of pliers to a propane torch.My primary computer is a Macbook Air 1.7GHz I5 with 128G and another with 256G. This review is for usage on those two units. I switched to the air due to weight, ease of travel, and it does everything I need to do on a day to day basis. As I'm rarely stationary I have a once a week back-up reminder set as a minimum and do not have a back-up drive constantly attached however I do try to do so daily.The Seagate Back Up Plus is light, fits easily into my everyday kit, the usb cord is of ample length and it was instantly recognized by my Air. I compared it side by side to my current back-up unit a LaCie Porsche design unit that is within 2-3 ounces and 10mm in size. It backs up 2G in almost exactly the same time. I then partitioned it into 350g/150g to store extra files and also back-up. It will transfer 2g of files in nearly exactly the same time as well. So it's fast, quiet, light and easy to transport. Why the 3.5 stars you ask? It's plastic, the top is a silver colored plastic, the sides are white plastic and I question it's durability for everyday travel and use. The LaCie unit is encased in 5mm of solid aluminum and is an exact, and I mean exact match to the brushed aluminum of the Mac's. I don't worry about travel, handling, dropping it (it's been dropped countless times) and it's price point is very close. So close in fact that I question the Seagate price point and value for price considering it's pressed together plastic construction.If I didn't have to travel with it, where it wouldn't get tossed into my everyday bag which in turn gets thrown into overheads, car trunks, floors behinddesks, lunch counters, kicked out of the way, used as a pillow, etc etc and the minor price difference made a difference to my budget and it could sit quietlyon my desk, well then maybe.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Slightly better than my venerable D90 but not a great upgrade.", "body": "I have been a Nikon user for many years and I shoot semi pro here and there when needed.  I don't need too many features to take a shot and I don't need to spend a fortune either just for bragging rights but would like a good all around camera.  I have known many great photographers from the past that can best anything with simple old school devices so the \"features\" in these newer cameras are questionable.The D90 was my previous DSLR and worked well with a very good low light sensor.  I found myself using the video feature more than I expected and without a continuous auto focus in video, the D90 was not cutting it.  In sunlight you can not see the LCD well enough to manually focus video so it had to go.  The D7100 was the closest replacement (Nikon) but with an auto focus video mode so I opted for it.Once received, I immediately generated a set of indoor test images between the D90 and the D7100 using controlled lighting, same lenses, settings, etc.  In a blind test with a fellow photographer, he was barely able to choose the D7100 over the D90 in 2/3's of the hundreds of images -- I could hardly tell the difference either.  There are some features with the shutter speed that is better with the D7100 but overall it is a minor upgrade at best in image quality.The D7100, even with the 51-point focus, still suffers from poor logic in any and all modes for focus.  Like all other Nikon's I have had, I end up using point focus or just go manual when it counts as the software does not know what to focus on for the most part.  Even simple tests I have made it is a hit or miss what it does for auto focus.  It would be nice to leave that aspect alone when shooting sometimes but I can't it seems.  The focus gets much worse as the light trails off which you may expect given the contrast detection  I assume it uses in the algorithm since the only time it gets it right is in bright light.  My friend's D800 seems to be very similar in our tests for auto focus logic (or lack thereof).I still find myself just going near full manual to get a shot I really care about all in all.  I would like to simply use an auto mode and hand the camera off to a friend to take some images I would be in, but I can never trust these Nikons to do the right thing.  I often just bring a point and shoot for those times to make sure I at least get a shot of some kind.  Would be nice to rely on one camera though.The video mode works well enough but also has odd focus problems, but at least it has something to help when you can not see the LCD well enough in bright outdoor light.  If it was not for the lenses I have for it I may just use an HD point and shoot for video as it usually handles focus better for some reason -- lacks image quality of course.\\Overall it has been so-so.  The battery does not last as long as in the D90 either.I may consider other makes next time as this price range for Nikon is seemingly just upped megapixel rehashes of the past with mostly more bells and whistles.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Good for the money.", "body": "When my Canon A710is died, I needed a point-and-shoot that would fit a pocket better, offer similar zoom range, and good battery life... and I needed it quickly. I did some quick research, and had settled on another camera, but came across a deal I couldn't pass up on Amazon. Being short on cash I decided to look into it further. The Lumix rated well on some of the review sites, so I went with it.  For the money, this is a solid performer.First the bad.  It takes very natural pictures in good light, but in lower light the pictures look a little overprocessed by the noise reduction in the camera.  It's also noticeably slower to focus as the light level drops.  It does have a focus assist light, but it seems like the camera first tries to focus without it, then turns it on and tries again.. making focus in poor light annoyingly slow.  The flash is strong, but a little harsh compared to the A710.  Most of this is only visible in side by side comparison to photos from the A710, so unless you blow up your photos and print them, it's really not a problem.  Using the iA mode drastically slows down the performance of the camera.  The idea is good, but with every shot, the camera takes nearly a full second to decide on settings to use for that shot.  In theory that's nice, but I think the camera may have too many choices for it's own good. The flash is also very slow to charge between shots.Now the good.  When you use the other scene modes or manual settings, the performance really speeds up.  It's never what I'd consider a snappy performer, but shot to shot times and shutter release to recorded image times drastically improve.  The display is sharper and brighter than the A710, and the controls are just as intuitive, if a little different (OK, yeah... I'm a Canon fan).  The zoom is relatively fast for a camera in this class, and it has a neat little E.zoom button next to the shutter that very quickly takes you from whatever zoom setting you're currently at to full optical zoom, full optical + digital zoom, and back to wide angle.  I find this feature to be very handy.  The LZ8's wide angle lens is nice, and because of this it's easier to use in small spaces than most other point and shoots I've owned.  It's quick to power on and off, and I found the controls easy to use even with large hands. I also like the fact that the SD card door is separate from the battery door. The face detection is nice, but makes the camera just slightly slower.Battery life in the short time I've had it has been exemplary.  I used up the set that came with the camera the first day I had it, which made me a little nervous, but I immediately switched to the 2300 mAh rechargeables I used in my old camera and performance has been great.  Between experimenting with it the first week I had it, two birthday parties, a weekend at the beach, and day to day use I still haven't drained the second set of batteries yet.. after around 300 photos, many with flash.  I never got more than 200 shots out of the A710, usually somewhere around 80 to 100. Flash recharge time is increasing as the batteries drain, as expected, but is noteworthy on a camera with such a slow recharge time to begin with. Most likely, after I've finished stretching battery life as far as I can, I'll get back into my old habit of swapping in fresh batteries before every event.Overall this camera isn't a great replacement for the A710, but as the 710 was a higher end (and therefore more expensive) camera back when I bought it, it's not completely fair to compare it to the LZ8. Having said that, I did expect the performance of a 4 year newer camera in this class to be slightly better. I bought this camera so I don't have to carry my dSLR around all the time, and for that purpose it's great.  It stays in my work van most of the time, and fits a jacket pocket on a motorcycle ride easily. Battery performance so far is good enough that I would be comfortable not carrying a spare set for a day if the ones in the camera are fairly fresh.. a new experience for me. It's inexpensive enough that I wouldn't get upset if it were to get damaged, but still takes satisfactory pictures. It lost one star for the sluggish performance in iA mode and slightly soft low light images.  The other star was lost for it's slow full shutter press to image taken time. I made the right choice for the money I had to spend at the time, and for about $130 (with overnight shipping) this camera performs well.", "rating": "mixed"}

Have to admit they both sounded awesome outside.  I put them side-by-side and listened to the same song over and over with each speaker.  The play1 has much sharper highs.  It seems to drown out a lot of everything else but not really in a bad way.  The play 3 has much more mids and a slightly better low-end bass response.  The lows hit a little harder, deeper and cleaner, but it was slight and really not a \"wow what a difference\" moment.  The mids seem to overtake everything here.  I messed around with the eq setting for each speaker.  Funny, the play3 has a setting for Left/right.  Really?  The speaker might be stereo itself but it is not a stereo listening experience.  Being that I had to really go back and forth between the 2 speakers to really get a sense of their differences tells me they are not that much different.  To my ears anyway.  Worth the extra $100?  I don't know.  Some music sounds a little better and the rest sounds the same. Considering that I would just use sonos to add background sound to a room, I think the play1 is absolutely fine. It is also much easier and lighter to carry the thing around than the play3.  Again, I think the Sonos stuff is really overpriced.  The bridge should be free since you cannot do anything with it alone.  Ultimately, I need a speaker I can bring all around the house and outside.  The play1 & bridge is a $250 setup.  I had a $100 gift card.  So, $150 sits easier with me.  I think it's the price it should be anyway.  ***I discovered you can use different apps on your phone and pc (like Windows Media Player) to send songs (Play-to) to the sonos speaker, bypassing the Sonos app.  Really cool.******************************************************************************end of update.So, been thinking of sonos for years.  (I am just interested in music, not the home theater aspect of Sonos).  Currently have a Yamaha receiver w/ Airplay in the living room.  All my music is on google play online, where I can store all of my 50GB of music.  Pull it up on the iPad, hit \"Airplay\" and it sounds great on my home theater speakers.  The only thing is that Airplay does tend to drop-out sometimes.  This is a pretty big deal.  But, this setup is costing me zero dollars, I can attach a pair of speakers outside to the \"B\" outputs on my receiver too.  But that requires running the lines.So, I got the Play1 with the bridge and then a week later got the Play3 to test that out for comparison.  With these, you get a speaker with an amp built in and it's wireless.  But it is still a lot of $ for the gear. They don't give the specs for their speakers or amps.  I don't like that at all.  I hate it when companies tell the consumers what they think we should care about.I am just not sure about the sound quality of the Play1 and 3.  Here is my problem, I'm used to listening to music in stereo.  When I listen to a single play1/3, the sound is very direct (obviously), and there is no separation.  It is also a \"treated\" sound, similar to Bose.  It sounds a bit unnatural.  As if the speakers are just trying too hard to produce sound that they physically cannot reproduce.  Do they sound good?  Sometimes.  Sometimes there is too much mids, bass or lack thereof.  It all sounds very small.  And the louder they play the worse it gets.  I have a moderate HT setup.  Klipschs FR speakers connected to a $600 Yamaha receiver.  Nothing too fancy.  Maybe I am spoiled.Also, besides having a NAS or leaving your computer running when playing music, there is currently no free online storage method of streaming your music.  This would change if Sonos gets google music or if Amazon cloud storage suddenly removed their 250-song limit.The play 1 is in my kitchen & living room (open floor plan house).  And I think to myself, why not just use the Airplay?There are options though.  Getting 2 play1 speakers, now this is getting pricey.  Forget their speakers and just get the Connect or the Connectamp.  Way overpriced.  If the connect was $100, now that would be a game changer.  I just can't see spending $350 for something that just acts as a conduit to play my music on their app.  And $500 for the Connect amp?I think perhaps Sonos is just too overpriced. I'll continue to listen in hopes of discovering something that makes this all worth it.  But for now, this is what I have come up with, for what it is worth:Sonos excels at:Playing music that does not drop out at all!  (not sure if this alone justifies the price tag)Whole-house (background) audio.  If someone has a lot of separate rooms and wants audio in each, yes this would fit the bill. But really only for background music IMO.  They start to show their limitations the louder they get.  You're not going to rock a dance party with any of the Sonos speakers, unless you are running multiple pairs of (maybe) the play 5's.Having a wireless speaker that you can take around the house/outside.", "rating": "mixed"}

So take my review with that in mind too. The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic mouse feels comfortable, but falls short on its promise of &#34;maximizing wrist comfort while making navigation effortless&#34;.About &#34;wrist comfort&#34;, it is too low for me, so it does not really support my wrist in a semi-vertical position as I hoped it would. And there is very little difference in my wrist position compared to my full-size Kensington Pro-Fit Full Size mouse. I can glue a bit of mini-cell foam to the Kensington mouse and get much better support. Still, slight advantage to the Microsoft mouse here out of the box, but not significant. Perhaps, for someone with small hands/short fingers, it would offer better angle.As for the &#34;effortless navigation&#34;, it is considerably worse than the Kensington. This is for two reasons: first, it is heavy, so when I need to reposition it, I'm lifting a hefty mouse; second, the area at the thumb is slippery, so I have to hold tight. In contrast, the Kensington is light and sticky (I have the wired version, which is probably lighter than the wireless version with batteries).Setup was automatic, quick, and easy on my Windows 7 machine. The BlueTooth USB piece is a bit bigger than the smallest out there, but not as big as the worst of them. Fits nicely inside the mouse when not in use and is held in place by a magnet (as is the bottom cover - no tabs to break).The movement is smooth and without apparent delay, so it works well as a mouse.However, because it is fairly expensive (even discounted to about $40), does not really offer significant ergonomic advantage for me, is heavy and slippery, so it is not the ideal mouse for me.", "rating": "mixed"}

The Sony stereo has four really good speakers in it, and one of them is a sub-woofer. This enables sound quality that no \"internet radio\" can even come close to producing.It also allows for completely portable use, because even though it is cumbersome to tote around a notebook computer and a portable boombox-type stereo, both devices can run on batteries, and the notebook computer has wireless capability, as well as a jack for cable modem.And then there's the convenience of simply being able to use a browser in Windows XP or Vista to navigate exactly to where you want to go without a lot of knob fiddling, or going through a bunch of complicated gyrations just to set up a Favorites list of stations.  Plus, you've got an on-board hard drive in the notebook, and the ability to play/record DVD's and CD's.*** Revision, April 22, 2009 ***  Finally have this figured out!

Bottom line: I'll have all the advantages of a tiny net-browsing notebook, great speakers in their own carrying case, and the ability to run everything on batteries if I want to, and the total cost to me is $304. Compare that with $279 for the Squeezebox, which really can't compare. Cheers! ***", "rating": "mixed"}

And while these offer decent sound -- especially at the price point at which they are offered now -- that's not the only basis on which I judge headphones.For context, I use these while walking, getting from point A to point B on the subway, while I\"m at the gym or on the treadmill at home, in order to listen to a vast array of stuff. I want solid sound -- it doesn't need to be spectacular; I'm not an audiophile and if I were just sitting and listening to the music I'd be doing it at home where I wouldn't need headphones or would be using a pair of on-ear headphones. I need a long cord, so that I'm not always jerking my iPod out of a pocket or wrenching my head forward to prevent a disaster. I need stability -- these things need to stay put in my ears, so that I'm not hyper-vigilant about how I move while wearing them.Well, these fail badly on the last count. It doesn't seem to matter how I play around with the foam covers for the earbuds, or whether I drape the cords behind or in front of my ears. These earbuds seem to have a suicidal impulse, tending to leap out of my ears at the slightest jostle, or work their way out until I realize, in irritation, that the sound has gradually gone tinny and work them back in again. Yes, the sound, on the whole, is better than theBose IE2 audio headphones, but if I'm not getting the full benefit of that sound without what I feel to be a disproportionate amount of effort, then what does that matter? The fact that these are on the short side is another issue that contributes to this problem -- I can't always just tuck the iPod in a pocket and listen to it when walking without always being conscious of whether I've got enough slack in the cords to prevent them from being pulled out of my ears.One of the great features of these earphones -- in principle, at least -- is the ready access to volume controls and a pause button. Again, however, there's a design flaw. The controls are placed very high up, between one of the earbuds and the spot where the two strands connect to lead down into the iPod. That's extremely awkward in practice -- either you have to whip your arm across your lower face to reach it or contort the arm that is one same side as the controls to try and reach it. In practice, I found I was taking the earphones out of my ears when I needed to hear what was going on, and reverting to controlling the volume on the device itself.These are pretty, I love the red color and the carrying case, and the sound is very solid for what these earphones are. But they'll remain a back-up pair in my household -- and the quest for the perfect in-ear headphones will continue...", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Think twice before trading your Fujifilm X-100 for the Sony NEX-7!", "body": "Although the Fujifilm X-100 has been the best camera (film or digital) I've ever owned, I took delivery on a NEX-7 earlier this week and went so far as to list my faithful X-100 on eBay.  Well after two days of using the NEX-7 I \"delisted\" my X-100 (thankfully no one had bid on it) and telephoned Sony for an RMA number.  For although the NEX-7 looks good on paper, is very quality, and has generated unequivocally positive reviews, it suffered from three fatal flaws as far as I'm concerned:1) Despite being generally high-quality, the EVF viewfinder -- as is the case with all the EVF finders I have used so far -- is virtually as useless as LCD finders on sunny days on the water.  Since I take about 50% of my photos on cruises or during yacht races, this makes the NEX-7 unacceptable for my needs.  The X-100 on the other hand has a superb optical finder (as well as a decent EVF) that comes into its own under these circumstances.2) Most of the remaining 50% of my photos are candid indoor or evening available light candids; and I hate to have to use a flash with these.  Here, the slow speed of the \"kit\" zoom made these shots murky and hard to discern details; especially when compared with the superb results of the X-100 under these same conditions.  I had  the fast 24mm and 50mm lenses on order, but they aren't expected to be available in quantity until the end of the month.  And, even then I'll have spent about twice the price of the X-100 to match what the X-100 offers in low-light conditions right now.  Also, the resolution of the NEX-7 kit zoom doesn't hold a candle to the X-100's resolving power; especially in the corners of 8x10's that I printed last night.3)  From the size standpoint, the NEX-7 with any of its lenses is about twice the depth of the X-100; and this renders several of the small cases and gadget bags that easily fit the X-100, totally useless.  The best example is the Sun Sniper SnapR which is my favorite X-100 carrying device since it combines a sling & a case in one integrated package.  Unfortunately the NEX-7 will never be able to fit into it or similiarly-sized cases until Sony releases a pancake lens with the resolving power and focal length of the X-100's.For all of these reasons, if you're addicted to always have the \"latest and greatest\" camera, I'd recommend staying with the X-100 for now.  And similarly, if you're looking for a truly high-quality \"king of the hill,\" despite its quirks, I'd say that for now I think the X-100 is still on top and is likely to be for some time if you don't want to spend more than $1400 and if resolving power, low light performance and suitability for composing photos in extremely bright shooting conditions are among your priorities.", "rating": "mixed"}

I suppose that is sort of standard, but for such a \"high quality\" product it is unacceptable.P.S. I take very good care of my electronics, there is barely a smudge on my white edition Big Jambox.EDIT: So several months after writing this review I decided to contact Jawbone again, to see if they could at least repair my Jambox. After many e-mails back and forth support eventually informed me that they had talked to their manager and would be replacing my Jambox. Why they didn't do this 6 months ago when I first contacted them is beyond me, but I'm happy to get it replaced. They make the consumer pay to ship to them, which is a bit disappointing. I will update my review again once I have had this for a long while.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Decent drive, defective cable", "body": "I've had this drive for about a week now and it seems like a good performer, small light and zippy. I'm only giving it 3 stars for 2 reasons.First, the USB cable that came with it was defective leading to an intermittent connection between drive and PC. I'd almost returned the drive for refund before I realized that the problem was with the cable. Still, you'd think that for a $179 device the manufacturer would give more attention to details like ensuring that a good quality cable is included.Second, the build quality is not perfect. The USB port on the drive is slightly mis-aligned relative to the opening in the case. This makes it just a little awkward to insert the plug into the drive.At any rate, the drive itself seems to be living up to expectations so far.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Decent, but Expected More", "body": "I bought this unit for use on hikes, bike rides, and other similar outdoor activities.  I've had it for a few months now, and overall, I'm only somewhat satisfied.  Here's a list of pros and cons that have stuck with me so far:Pros:-easy to read/see color screen (even in bright sunlight)-highly customizable screens (types and amount of data shown on each screen)-fairly easy to learn and operate-many features, including barometric altimeter and electronic compassNow, the cons to this product may not be specific to this unit.  It may be more a function of the limitations of GPS:-inaccurate (sometimes highly) \"tracking\" of horizontal position or trail actually traveled (I've compared to trail maps and Google Earth visible trails, and some of my tracks are inexplicably way off)-inaccurate barometric altimeter (sometimes hundreds of feet off.  I've turned it on, and had elevation readings of -200 feet!!) which must be constantly calibrated.  Also, if you calibrate at the bottom of a climb, by the time you reach the summit, it may be over 100' off.-very inaccurate odometer data, and inconsistencies in the data.  For example, I recently hiked Half Dome, which is 4800' vertical gain...this unit only registered 1500' total ascent, but the begin elevation and end elevation shown were well over 1500' different.  Also, on the same Half Dome hike, the odometer read 5 miles hiked, but the track total registered a more accurate 8.3 miles.-very \"stiff\" buttons.Again, the inaccuracy may be a function of the limitations of GPS, but the odometer inaccuracies in terms of total distance, total ascent, descent, etc. was disppointing.  Perhaps Garmin needs to come up with another way of calculating these values.  I think a lot of these values are calculated using current horizontal and vertical velocity, which may be inaccurate at any given moment.  With inconsistencies at any given moment, it is difficult for the unit to calculate the actual horizontal and vertical distance traveled.In any case, overall, I would recommend this product for simple trail and waypoint marking.  But it should be understood you will only get \"general\" information, and not anything resembling very accurate data.**EDIT**  Garmin released a firmware patch in Feb of '08, and it has really helped with the accuracy of certain data.  The total ascent data is much more accurate now, often within 100' of actual climbed distance (that may not seem so great, but it was horrible before).  Also, the distance measurements are better.  When I save a track, the distance per the track is much more close to the odometer reading, usually within a mile for a 10-15 mile hike (which again, is just ok, but better than before).Overall, the unit does seem to be more accurate in all ways now, perhaps due in part to this firmware update.  Also, tracks seem to be more accurate in terms of comparing visually to maps.  I'm more happy with the unit now, and would probably give it 4 stars if I reviewed it today.", "rating": "mixed"}

Nice.- Lightweight but still a quality feel to the keyboard.- Looks nice- No sync issues, lag or anything wireless problems of any kind.  Unifying receiver works perfectly.The Bad:- A little hard to type on.  Doesn't have as easy of a typing feel as the old Microsoft wireless keyboard it replaced nor the keyboard on my high-end Dell business class laptop.  I am making a lot more mistakes typing with this- I knew this going in, but there aren't any &#34;extra function&#34; buttons on this.

{"title": "Decent unit, but poor tech support. VPN users should read!!", "body": "I bought this unit to connect my Gateway Athlon desktop running Windows 98SE and my new company-issued Dell P4 laptop running W2K, and share a Roadrunner cable internet connection via a Toshiba cable modem.  The Gateway is hardwired to the router, the laptop wireless via a Linksys wireless PC card.To connect to my corporate e-mail, I must use a VPN connection to the corporate server, and then connect to the mail server with Microsoft Outlook 2000 via Microsoft exchange server.  I've been doing so for years without a hitch on the Gateway.Hardwired to the Linksys router, my Gateway easily connected to both the VPN and the MS exchange mail server. The cable internet connection was shared successfully between the two computers, and I could transfer files from one computer to another, share the printer, digital camera port, et al, without a hitch.HOWEVER, I could not access my corporate e-mail account with the laptop, either using the wireless Linksys PC card or using a hard-wired connection with the Dell's built in 10/100 3com NIC card. I could complete a VPN connection, but when Outlook tried to open the program responded &quot;The Microsoft Exchange Server is unavailable&quot;.  Yet I could connect the laptop directly to the Toshiba cable modem, and access my corporate e-mail with either the ethernet port or a USB connection.  Oddly too, the VPN connection appeared &quot;dead&quot;;  ie, I had no internet connectivity for my web browsers, etc, when the VPN was connected.I tried unsuccessfully changing a number of different settings in W2K and in the Router's web-based configuration utility.  I studied all the online documentation at Linksys' web site, but found nothing specific to my situation.  I searched the web for answers, but was unsuccessful.  I e-mailed Linksys corporate support, and got a e-mail full of suggestions for port forwarding, DMZ, ad nauseum, none of which worked.I then spent over two hours on two separate calls to Linksys' tech support.  The first tech thought I needed to upgrade the firmware and told me where to download and to call back if I needed more help.  The firmware he suggested refused to load on the router.  I called back, jumped through a few more hoops, before the technician declared the modem &quot;defective&quot; and that I should return for an exchange.I was on the verge of returning the both Linksys units for a  refund, and buying Netgear wifi equipment (which I'd read here are more VPN friendly).  I'm stubborn, though, and made one final Google search of usenet rather than the internet.  After an hour or so of searching, I stumbled across a recommendation to change the router's internal IP number from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.xxx.1.  It was for a somewhat different problem and a different brand of router, and I had no idea whether it would work or not but I was desperate.I opened the web based configurator and changed only the internal IP address for the router.  I repowered router and rebooted the laptop.  I was amazed (and delighted!) to see my laptop seemlessly connect to the VPN AND my Microsoft Exhanger server e-mail account.  And I turned off all the security-reducing port forwarding and WAN filter disabling that Linksys' tech support had urged me to implement to try and get it working.  All of that was absolutely needless.I recounted this tale of woe to the local computer store where I'd purchased the unit.  He was dismayed that Linksys' tech support didn't have such a simple solution on hand.  It only took 10-12 hours of my life in web searches, software tweaking, et al, but the router finally worked perfectly.It's a good unit for a simple, straightforward &quot;vanilla&quot; installation.  However, if your configuration is &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; or complicated,  I would recommend staying away from this product unless you're already a networking guru and don't require support from Linksys.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Read the small print! THIS REVIEW MAY HELP YOU", "body": "I purchased a Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player as I don;t have cable TV, but I do have WiFi internet.I wanted to be able to watch Netflix on my basement tv ( which was only picking up the basic TV stations, ABC, CBS, PBS, etc.I hate watching adverts and prefer to choose my own uninterrupted programs.Setting up the device is a little tricky!Step 1.  Plug it in to the HDMI slot on the TV.  No problem there. I had a slot and I used the supplied short extension HDMI (about 4&#34;) to connect it. Look carefully at the advert - in the small print off to one side they mention that you need a power cord. They actually supply a plug-in power pack that you need to plug into the Chromecast device.  Not a problem really, but make sure that you have a spare outlet.Step 2.  Switch on the TV and go though the modes until you find the HDMI channel you plugged the device into.  It displays nice pictures to look at when you find it.  Again, easy enough.Step 3.  This is where it gets interesting.  Make sure that you have a computer, phone, etc that is listed in the small print in the advert:Supported Operating SystemsAndroid 2.3 and higheriOS 6 and higherWindows 7 and higherMac OS 10.7 and higherChrome OS (Chromebook Pixel, additional Chromebooks coming soon).Be aware that if you don't have WiFi, Windows 7 on  your computer, or the correct Operating System on your phone, it won't set up!I went to the google.com/chromecast/setup on my WiFi computer with Windows 7 and was able to get through the first step, getting it to find and activate the device plugged into the TV.  I think that this is where a lot of people think that they have completed the setup and think that the device is not working.What I didn't notice initially was that a second window opens up after a short while to allow you to download the program that sets up the computer to put the little Chromecast App onto your computer or other device. It was hiding BEHIND the Chromecast setup window!  Once you find this and enable it you can use the device successfully - -for the listed places, like Netflix, etc.  Again very carefully read the list of what the device can do.What it DID NOT DO!I tried adding it to my Motorola Admiral cell phone, which has the Android OS 2.3, but it didn't want to let me Accept the App - just washed out the screen and froze up.  After a lot of playing with it I found a message that said that the device is not currently able to work on my version of the Android 2.3 Operating System!  So, I'm not able to use my phone to control the device. If you have a lower end phone like me then you may have an issue.Having said all that.IT DOES WORK WELL at putting Netflix, etc on my TV.  I can use the computer to do other things whilst the program plays, but I have to go back to the computer to control the program, stop, pause, etc. I'm happy that it does what I purchased it for. Picture quality and sound were excellent on my very high speed internet connection.You can name the device and then you could actually put one on different WiFi TVs and send different programs to each TV of necessary.If you have Cable or Sat TV it would not be much use to you, unless you want to view stuff from your computer or cell phone, but it does have a use if you do a lot of Internet viewing.Go the the Google Chromecast webpages and you'll find the answers to most of the problems you may have setting it up, and also what it will and will not work with at the current time.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Quirky", "body": "I researched media players for a long time, and I knew what I was getting into.  The info in the Amazon reviews is pretty much all you need.The user interface is, indeed, full of stupid quirks and infuriating limitations.  When you are in the menu structure or browsing a list, the volume button doesn't control volume.  So if the music itself gets loud at that point, you will damage your hearing.  Well, as long as you are just listening to music, the screen lock is handy; you can indeed use the fwd/back, pause/play, and volume buttons with one hand while it is in your pocket.The sound quality is ... mostly dependent on your transducers.  See my review of the Sennheiser IE6s.I was disappointed with the parametric equalizer.  It is a true parametric equalizer ... except that for each of the filter bands you are limited to only 5 specific frequencies.  It's great that you can adjust that, and the bandwidth too, but still limiting.  E.g., only the first filter (out of 5)  can do bass.  And the lowest frequency you're allowed to tune is 80 Hz.Battery life:  Less than half of what was advertised.  I'm always trying to decide if I'm willing to send it in for battery replacement.  I would expect this only after 2-3 years of use (since lithium batteries always deteriorate), not for a new product.  I think that the equalizer itself consumes more battery power.  THat would make sense if the filter implementation code is not efficient.  I now leave the eq off (\"Normal\" setting) since I got good earbuds.  Now I can do music for 5-10 hours per charge (not 50).  I also cannot use the Sleep function because the battery will die; I turn it all the way off each time.  Well, you will probably have better luck if your battery is not defective like mine.The iamoled picture quality is just gorgeous.  In a few years I know the color rendering will deteriorate... but so would a paper photography book, after all.  I'll buy something else at that point!The FM radio is a lot louder than the mp3/ogg/etc decoder.  With my low-impedance earbuds, even volume = 1 (out of 40) is too loud.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.On the first day, my S9 froze.  THe screen stayed on and consumed battery for several hours until I found the reset button.  It kept doing this until I reinstalled the firmware;  then it was stable.  Note that the player has a FAT32 file system on it: so just like any memory-stick, if you don't \"safely eject\" before unplugging, you stand a good chance of corrupting the files, and this is probably what causes the crashing.Thank you to Cowon for including OGG and FLAC -  now my music is open-source.  And Media Monkey is awesome, by the way.  I use MSC mode and let MediaMonkey copy files over.  You have to put cover.jpg in each album's directory; the player won't recognize embedded art.The updated firmware has a fun customizable UI.  Together with user backgrounds, the music listening screen is very attractive.  Definitely learn how to download & install firmware; then you won't mind so much if it gets corrupted.You will not find a replacement USB cable anywhere except from Cowon.

Among those I found in a local store (Fry's), this came the closest, so despite its small size, I ended up at home with it.The good: It is surprisingly comfortable.  In fact, more so than much larger mice, like the Logitech MX 1000 for BlueTooth (included  with the Logitech DiNovo Desktop Laser combo).The charging cradle allows you to avoid replacing the batteries every week (they do run out this fast; I tried).The not so good: Without recharging, the battery life is pretty short.Out of the box, the tracking speed is pretty fast - and the movement is a bit jerky.  Both of these can be fixed (in Mac OS X) by going to the Keyboard/Mouse panel in System Preferences and reducing the tracking speed there.It is notably slower to come alive than other BT mice, including Apple's.  Also, if your Mac is asleep, waking it up will not automatically wake the mouse (again, unlike a couple of other mice, like Apple's).  You have to click one of the mouse keys (or scroll the wheel).Also, it frequently happens that only the buttons and the scroll  wheel wake up, not the optical sensor that allows the mouse to move.  The only way I found to get around this is to turn off the mouse, wait a few seconds, turn it on again, click a button, and wait for it to pair with the computer.I ended up getting another BT wheel mouse online to replace it - one that is even more in line with the Apple style:[...]This one, I am happy to say, is quite an improvement over the BTMicro mouse in all these areas.-tor", "rating": "mixed"}

No intention of 3D use.I came from a 20&#34; acer, 1600/900 led 60hz 2ms response (cost 119$), and the first thing I noticed was how wash out and shallow the colors look on this monitor.

Fortunately I brought my own trusty level with me and was able to re-drill the holes, but I wasted a lot of time and created unnecessary holes in the wall in the process.

{"title": "A couple of initial freeze ups, those were fixed, but my opinion has changed. . .", "body": "The professional reviews of this series are correct.  The cooling system is quiet and very effective.  The screen is nice, but does pick up reflections in bright light.  The machine is fairly heavy and you will need to buy a bag or sleeve meant for 18\" screens because the thickness of the laptop prevents it from fitting in most 17.3 bags.  The battery dies fast and furious, though you can squeeze out over an hour of use if you are just web browsing and turn down the screen backlighting.  I wanted an ATI powered rig, not NVIDIA, and this fit the bill.  I've had a couple of the grey bars of death screens that apparently are common with this series.  That has been the most disconcerting issue.  Hopefully some future 5870 drivers will clear that up.  I wiped the drive and installed Windows 7 Ultimate. The laptop includes a utilities installation disk.Update 1/13 - The computer continues to function pretty well.  I haven't used it for gaming recently, but I have not had any more of the \"grey bars\" crashes.  All drivers and bios are updated.A different issue has developed: the built-in touch pad seems to loose sensitivity and/or malfunction periodically.  This is very annoying as I use the laptop in multiple locations and rely on the touch pad - I do not carry around an extra mouse with me.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it, and updating the driver did not solve the issue. It goes through periods of not working, automatically resizing the window when I do not want to and other irksome issues.Update 2/10 - Over the last several days I have been using this laptop for gaming.  Nothing major - mostly \"Two Worlds\" on maxed settings.  \"Two Worlds\" is a perfectly dull, buggy game I would not recommend to anyone, but it does have graphics that will push the mobile 5870 card a bit on maxed settings.  When I first received the laptop (before updates) it was a game that gave me a couple of my GSODs.  Anyway - no GSODs now.  Updating everything seems to have worked.  I haven't had a GSOD (knock on wood) since December.  Now I will have to try a game that is actually worth playing!  I have a tower I have dedicated to major games - and it's hooked to a 60\" Sony TV, so it is hard to use my newest stuff on the laptop for long periods when I can use the larger system instead.)Update 4/26 - I've tried several other high demand / graphics intensive games on the laptop.  It runs them very well.  However, a new issue has appeared that seems to be common with this type of ASUS power supply.  I discovered the jack that plugs into the laptop was bent sideways.  I am very careful with my electronics - the laptop has never been banged or dropped and as far as I know the cord has never been jerked while plugged in.  I can only assume the weight of the cord somehow bent the plug, or that it had a crack inside that widened at some point.  Now the cord is shorting out.  I did some research and it does appear that the power bricks are a weak link in for this series - both for failing or (to a lesser extent) physical issues like my bent jack.  So. . .now I've been trying to get my power supply replaced by ASUS. . .and as many others have reported, dealing with them directly is no fun.  I've received inconsistent replies and RMAs that initially requested I send in the entire computer.  The issue is relatively new, but as of yet unresolved.  At the moment I'm still giving this laptop four stars, though I would rate ASUS customer service around one and a half or two at the present time.Update 5/11 - The power supply issue is resolved.  ASUS eventually shipped me a new one, though it took a bit of wrangling with multiple customer service people before the item was sent.  Once sent, it was shipped quickly. Strangly, the replacement feels lighter weight than the original - somewhat filmsier perhaps, though it is difficult to say for certain without the original here to compare (I had to send them the original - shipping at my expense).  Now I'm paranoid about the plug breaking again as the other one bent with little or no provocation. Overall the customer service experience was about two stars out of five.  If you have a problem, do not email them.  Call them and keep calling if the RMA they send you isn't related to your issue. They also tried to get me to give them a credit card number to keep on file.  I absolutely refused to divulge that information.Update 09/2011 - Overall still somewhat recommended. . but I would not buy one of these huge gaming rigs from ASUS if I had it to do over.  I recently bought a Lenovo Thinkpad and put in a top of the line SSD.  It scores better for overall processing power in windows than this laptop, and it weighs a fraction of the weight and the Lenovo's battery will last for hours and hours, even gaming.  The battery on the ASUS just dies ridiculously quickly.  I do not trust the power cord since the new one seems flimsier than the one it replaced.  Because of the odd angle it hangs off the laptop (and the weight of the cord itself) I feel like it has to be constantly supported and watched as it would be easy to snap off.  Thus, this laptop is best when it is stationary at a desk and not moved.  Lugging it around is pure work.  The weight is OK for very short distances, but on trips this thing is just not a realistic nor welcome companion.  If you are going to buy it and leave it on a desk, why not just buy a tower PC or build one yourself?Finally, customer service through ASUS was pure frustration.  Unfortunately I'm knocking off a star.  Not a bad machine, but not a sensible investment for gaming when you can get a much more powerful PC that can just as effectively sit immobile.", "rating": "mixed"}

In comparison this printer maxes out at 4800 x 1200 DPI and is a 2pl system... and while the prints are still fine, there is an obvious difference between them and my other printer (especially when printing small images, I do a lot of jewelry/resin work with prints and couldn't use this printer for that reason, which really is unfortunate as I wanted to set it up in my craft room).That said, it's by no means an awful printer. If you only occasionally print photos, and are looking for an attractive all in one which offers wireless printing it's a great little printer. I've had no issues printing from my cell phone or tablet. Getting it up and on our network was quick and easy and it connects & prints very quickly wirelessly.I've opted to give it to my almost 10yr old daughter, who has no issues printing (even direct from her camera card), and for whom the print quality is more than sufficient.

Only after installing a local server I realized that I did not need it to use Squeezebox in conjunction with Squeeze Network where I had to program my radio stations for stand-alone use.Pros:- great sound quality- stand-alone operationCons:- occasionally the box cannot connect to Squeeze Network which can be very annoying when you try to lower down the volume and you get no response- poor manual (maybe upgraded by now?), with no details on resolving firewall issues- I had problems playing asx Internet radio streams (even after upgrading firmware to revision 88)- it seem like Logitech support is as familiar with this device as I am, if not less.  After several e-mails back and forth their best suggestion was to contact the radio station and ask if there is an alternative stream.  Eventually, I gave up and went to the Web to discover that asx is a play list format, and so I found where WM Player put it, looked at the content and found the ultimate stream location, however, I wonder why can't Squeezbox do it automatically?I also had a number of suggestions that I e-mailed Slim Devices (before Logitech bought them) but I never got any response from them.  Here are some of them that may be relevant to how you want to use your Squeezbox:- Why not support multi-line text with Wiki-style links e.g.[Radio.Internet.Address|My Favorite Radio]and allow people to trade their favorites?  This would be a great win for ethnic communities that are poorly supported now.- Favorites could use improvements - who will program 100 of them if they always have to start at the first choice?  At minimum the box should remember last choice and better yet, it should allow some type of directory structure to improve navigation.- Squeeze Network does not support secure login.  What is my password worth then?", "rating": "mixed"}

It clearly meets both of these needs, which is the primary purpose of this keyboard. It has the clickity clacky keys rather than the soft kind, so don't expect typing to be \"quiet\". For some reason, they decided to make the delete key much smaller in exchange for a slightly larger enter key, which seems counter intuitive to the point of the ez eyes portion of the keyboard.One of the reasons I went for the keyboard was the claim to being spill resistant. This was a complete hoax. As a matter of fact, this broke down more easily than previous keyboards. A single spill, not directly on the keyboard, completely decimated it. A completely false claim. It also lacks the finger divots at F and J for guidance when performing \"proper\" typing, another thing that I'd expect from a keyboard designed to make keyboarding easier.Other than that, it works like any other keyboard. If it fits the aesthetics of your home or if you have bad eyes and need it, this can be a functional keyboard for you, but it's claims are a little exaggerated. It's like every other cheap keyboard except it has yellow keys and bigger bold letters.

{"title": "Manfrotto 234RC Monopod Head: Good, Not Great", "body": "This is my first monopod head, and I was guided partly by the reasonable price and my uncertainty about how well I could control a ball head while supporting a monopod.  The 234RC rotates along one axis only, which is not a problem provided that you shoot primarily in landscape or primarily in portrait orientation.  If you find it necessary to do the 90 deg. rotation needed for changing from landscape to portrait, it is necessary to remove the camera, loosen the quick release plate on the bottom of the camera, and rotate it 90 deg.--an operation that I find fussy.  The quick release plate supplied with the head has arrows that point in the direction that the lens is looking, but these are cast into the plate and hard to see when out in the field shooting.  I traced over the markings with a Sharpie.The quick release mechanism is convenient to operate.  It takes only a second to snap the camera on or off.  The connection seems secure for a DSLR with a moderate weight lens.The major parts of the head are robust castings.  Reviews on other web sites complained about a slight residual movement in the rotation after tightening the knob.  This can be suppressed by tightening farther, but then you can't fine-tune the rotation without loosening the knob.  The problem is that the hole through which the hex-head bolt is placed is about 0.0125 inches wider than the bolt.  I cut some 1/2 inch strips of brass shim stock (0.003 inch--available from good hobby shops) which I rolled up and placed at each end of the hole in the part that screws onto the monopod.  This prevents unwanted residual movement.Bottom line: This tough head is good but not great.", "rating": "mixed"}

Look for CEA-2006. This amp is NOT 5000w or any of that. I read elsewhere that this bench tested approx. 700w @ 4ohms, 1,400w @ 2ohms, & 2001w @ 1ohm. I think that is about accurate, give or take a little. I just burned up a 600w peak MTX 10\" @ 4 ohms. I had a spare 800w 10\" Kole that I can beat up and play with the settings @ 4 ohms but, I couldn't max it out so easily. I'm upgrading to a 2 ohm dvc 12\" Alpine SWS 500w rms/ 1500w peak subwoofer that I will run @ 1 ohm. I think that will be a good match with the rms close to where this amp plays and any bass boast should be covered by 1500w peak. I will see real soon.Oh yeah, I received a refurb instead of new for under $150 and I haven't had a problem yet. I run it really warm for a few hour drive several times a week for work. That is also why I'm aiming to run it @ 1 ohm before something happens. Do not run this at 4 ohms. It is not that powerful, a waste of potential, and gets hot quickly...=================================================== UPDATE 1/1/13 ===================================================I fried the 1,500w Alpine SWS 12D2 in 4 days. I am now using the stronger Alpine SWR 12D2 with 3,000w peak at 1ohm. This amp is really powerful and I doubted it with my 1st impressions and tests. I had to buy a 2 farad Tsunami capacitor. It really helps but, I can still dim the headlights when I'm hammering it out hard. I tried to save a few bucks with the capacitor but, this amp needs a second battery and some good subs that can take it. I can top out an Alpine SWR 12D2 without it cranked and it sounds incredible. Definitely in with the big league systems.I'm only disappointed in a few things: the remote level control is not accurate like the Infinity control I had for years before this. (Maybe try an another brand of knob.) The 4gauge terminal connections are small and they lied about the watts. Further in the literature it does say \"5,000w when 2 amps are ran in sync with 1 as a slave amp\". What that really means is that, it only states that this is 2,500w/peak and is the best that they are actually claiming in the fine print but not on the cover...=================================================== Update 4/13/14 ==================================================I am still slamming the Alpine SWR12D2 in a sealed box without any issues. This pairing is ground shaking at times. I have this in a 2002 Jeep wrangler and people turn their heads from far away up the block when I coming. I highly recommend an XS 3400D battery to stop headlight dimming. I ate the big price of the battery but, WOW!

I have camera and laptop backpacks from Lowepro, Tamrac, Ape Case, and Think Tank, and quality-wise, this Case Logic backpack is far, far behind those brands.  The nylon wall seems flimsy, the padding is on the miserly side, and the backpack does not have a good structural frame.  However, the aforementioned brands cost three or four times more for a similar functionality, so that's something to factor in.  As it stands, I would recommend this for a day use at school or work, but definitely not for foot-travelling or hiking where the backpack would stay on your back most of the times.The main compartment has a lightly padded divider that holds the laptop against your back; the front compartment is smaller and has storage for pen, USB flash drives, etc., and a zippered pocket.  A nice touch is another zippered pocket between the main and front compartment, which is made of nice felt-like material.  Ideal for storing phones or PDA or MP3 players.  There are two side pockets, ideal for storing water bottles or other sundry items.For the price, I think this can be a useful backpack, as long as you don't expect too much out of it.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Ok desktop speakers, weak on range; headphone jack useless", "body": "I use them with my desktop computer (mac Mini).  They are powered speakers with a volume knob, blue power light, head phone jack, and speaker jack on the right speaker.  The speakers are slim and look good on the desk.  They are 10\" high (with stand) x 2.75\" wide x 2.75\" deep.  The round stand is  just under 4\" in diameter.  Each speaker is about half a pound in weight.The audio output is fine as a general speaker, but they do not wow.  As one might expect at this price point, the range is trapped in the middle with little bass and light on the high treble.  I can listen to my iTunes library for a few songs before I find myself missing the deeper sounds I get from my iPod player.  I will say, however, that the sound is better than what I get from my 2008 15\" MacBook Pro.  I think the main failing is the huge loss of volume I seem to get form the headphone port on the right speaker.  I tried three different headphones on that jack with the same result.. Basically an 80% loss in volume.  That renders the headphone jack essentially useless.So, these are okay speakers for the price point.  Pro:  Affordable, okay sound range, look good.  Cons:  Heavy on the mid-range, light on the bass and treble; useless headphone jack.  All-in-all, I would look around a bit more before buying these.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "If you want value, seek another option.", "body": "I went ahead and bought this despite negative reviews. I find the headset to my liking for the most part.First impression of the HD228 is that they have an appealing design.  The build however is on the flimsy side. I guess it is flimsy to make the headphones lightweight.  For this reason they are also very comfortable to wear, especially for an extended period of time.The sound quality is excellent and very natural, crisp with great range. As regards the base, it is not a strong base.  I personally do not like hard hitting base and prefer an ambient yet rich sounding base.  Therefore even though they sound great, do not expect a base with a lot of 'power' to it.  Bottom line, these are perfect for my acoustic EQ settings.With sound leakage it was surprisingly good. I had to raise the volume to two ticks below highest on my iPod before the sound began to leak. It leaked slightly and the person next to me had to listen carefully enough to confirm the leak.  The person could  not make out the music I was listening to.The cable is not as short as some say, I think.  To me the perfect cable length is on Apple's stock headphones since they do not dangle much if anything out of my pocket.  If I stick the iPod in my pocket with these headphones, the cable dangles an extra 12 inches as it comes up to my head.  I'm 5'9 and it wasn't pleasant to have the extra cabling in front of me, and stuffing it my pocket doesn't help much.  Still the length could be an advantage since it is long enough to use with a computer.  Also, the cable itself is one of those thin and rubbery types.  I think they should have gone with something more typical.  The cable moves very easily when it is made of this material and it could be bothersome if you're in movement.One thing I did not like, is the male jack of the cable.  It is over an inch in height!  Just imagine plugging the jack into your device and it sticks this much above the jack.  It looks dumb, and the fact that they stick the Sennheiser logo onto it, made it that much more annoying to me.In conclusion, I bought these headphones Refurbished for $25 with shipping included.  For that price, I am definitely satisfied. Most of my satisfaction comes from the sound quality, it's that good.  Yet, if you're going to spend $50+ on these new, I recommend that you reconsider your purchase. For the price, quality, sound, and usability factors, I would say spend your hard earned money on a competitive set of headphones that sound just as good if not better than these.  Also I suggest a look at Audio Technicas.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Not a great upgrade, but Tivo is still a must-have!", "body": "I'm the biggest fan of Tivo in the world. These magnificent devices have improved my life dramatically over the past six years. I have a series 2, series 3, and now the series 4. Unfortunately, I am not happy with the new Premiere machine. First, it's actually even slower than the older models. Tivo says they have a much faster processor, but it must be bogged down with too many tasks. Second, the Premiere tends to freeze much more often than the older machines - taking up to NINE minutes to restart. Yes, nine minutes of waiting for your show to start recording again. Third, the `picture-in-picture' feature in the corner of the menu page is extremely annoying. There is no way to turn it off. You can only mute your TV while in the menu. If you are recording sports the live feed will be in corner giving away the score before you can even start watching the game. I'm sure the only purpose of this feature is to force us to watch a commercial here and there. Fourth, there is a 30-second jump feature now that just fast-forwards. On the older Tivos you could fix the remote to jump ahead clean 30 seconds. It was instant. The new fast-forward jump is much slower. All in all, there are no improvements over the Tivo HD machine other than some extra storage space. If you already have Tivo save your money and wait to see what they come out with next year. If you don't have Tivo - you are missing out big time on the greatest invention since TV itself. So I'll give it 3 stars. That's an average of 5 stars for Tivo and 1 star for the Premiere box.", "rating": "mixed"}

The quality compared to more expensive units shows it's decidedly cheap steel from overseas. Also, the specs are slightly misleading. You can mount TVs up to 27\" wide, not necessarily a 27\" model. The weight limit is 60lbs when you tilt it to the 10 degree position. The manual is 16 pages long, but in 17 languages including English. 6 of the pages are diagrams that are pretty good. The hardware comes in a very nice, clever strung together pouches that are clearly labeled. The strap is good to poor depending on the design of you set. Some sets are too slanted or rounded for the strap to really hold onto. (This goes for all TV mount straps though.) I like to find a safe place in the TV chassis and run sheet metal screws from underneath up into the plastic underside of the TV. I have mounted approximately 1000 TVs in my line of work.

{"title": "Adequate for my purposes, but not what is advertised", "body": "I use this for real estate photos where I need a few extra feet of clearance for those tight spaces in bedrooms and bathrooms. The lens is adequate for that purpose for mid-range homes, though I would not use it for my upper price range homes (on which I usually hire a photographer anyway).Pros:--Macro lens works with minor distortion around the edges.--Wide angle lens (with macro) gives those extra few degrees of angle when you need it--CostCons:--Black ring around border when fully zoomed out--Wide angle does not give the full range of view as a true wide angle lens, but you get what you pay for. I didn't expect that for $13.--While the product page advertises you can use this as two separate lenses, that's not true. You can use the macro alone, which works just fine. However, the macro lens works as an adapter for the wide angle part, and without the macro lens in order for it to work you would need to purchase an adapter ring in it's place (guessing it's a 58mm). So you can't truly use this as two lenses out of the box.Would knowing the above have kept me from buying? Probably not as I wanted something cheap to use as a spare when needed. Though it would have been nice to know the above prior to purchasing so I'd be aware of the need for an additional ring to factor in cost, as well as having it ready in order to actually use the two lenses separately.", "rating": "mixed"}

I don't have any way of measuring the impact on overall speed. It certainly seems to improve startup and loading, but wi-fi performance is far more a factor than disk for me.It seems a good intermediate tool between standard hard disk and full SSD. I just wonder if it's worth paying the price rather than accepting OK laptop performance or buying a new machine.

{"title": "Works with Win 7, Doesn't like microwave ovens! Works with Apple N Routers", "body": "I have had this adapter for more than a year, and use it in my garage workshop which is about 70 ft through a door to my wireless \"N\" router.I originally had it installed on a Vista computer, but recently dumped that computer and put a Windows 7 computer in the Garage. The adapter works just as well as it did under Vista without any additional drivers... that was a nice surprise! I have the adapter mounted in its little stand rather than directly into a USB port.My speeds are OK... when it is fully connected to the network. I generally see two to three bar strength, and sometimes get warnings of low connectivity, but despite the warnings and the low bars, the speed is generally good enough for all my uses, including online video and audio streaming.That being said, I also ALWAYS know when my wife is cooking anything in the microwave in our kitchen, because the internet connection is completely interrupted until the microwave is off. I troubleshot this issue to determine whether it was the adapter, or my router, and it is definitely the adapter. (My other wireless systems including my laptops are NOT interrupted by the oven). This is not really a big issue for me as it usually means I am about to be fed anyway! So, I just quit what I'm doing until she's finished cooking.One other issue is that if you move the adapter from one USB port to another, you have to REINSTALL the drivers for it. It will not just work when switching ports.On a positive side, I use an Apple Extreme Airport Router and Apple Airport repeaters throughout the house and this adapter works without issue with them. There are also no issues with security via WEP.On the whole, this is a decent, inexpensive solution for computers that don't have built in wireless, and works well with Windows 7. If you can deal with the minor issues of Microwave interference, USB port changes, and a slightly lower strength readings than a more expensive solution, then you'll be happy.3 out of 5 stars for this unit due to the issues above.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Good case while docked, not great for just the tablet", "body": "I ordered this case after looking at a number of different options.  Based on the reviews and the video on Caseen's web site, it looked this case would be a good solution for my new tablet, both used on its own and when docked.First, the case is a very nice quality and appears to be well made.  There are a number of color options, which I appreciated; I purchased the green case from Caseen's web site.  I'm not sure why, but the leather on the right and left edges bulges a bit when I put my tablet in, and does not lay flat.  Also, the top edge of the case is very close to the top of the screen and sometimes makes it difficult to hit buttons that align with the top of the screen.The magnetic closure seems to work just fine with the tablet, and when I have the dock attached the strap holds everything closed.  When not docked, you can charge the tablet with the case closed, thanks to a little cut-away that can be opened/closed as needed.  I really like this feature.  When the dock is on the tablet it holds open very nicely and I don't have problems with it becoming unbalanced and falling over.Aside from some difficulty accessing menus/buttons along the top, the only thing I really don't like about this case is that it does not hold the tablet up when the dock is not attached.  The bottom is not sturdy when folded and it keeps falling over backward.  Also, even if it did stay upright, the angle of the screen is close to 90 degrees and is not the most comfortable for working with the tablet.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Good unit but not perfect", "body": "I wanted a portable GPS unit with at least 4\" display and text-to-speech feature. This is my first GPS. I would say the text-to-speech feature is a MUST; otherwise, you may get confused.A 4\" Garmin was too expensive and it didn't look very attractive.I like Navigon because it made GPS for European cars, it had photo images of the streets, and it looked really good but I need to get the expensive high-end model for the 4\" display (the free lifetime traffic info was very attractive too). However, it didn't have any audio and/or video features and several reviews indicated problems with navigation and the text-to-speech.I could pick TomTom but I liked HK. I picked it has mp3 feature. I wanted the GPS 510 video one but that costed more than I expected. Anyway, I guess I expected too much from HK.As a basic GPS unit, it's great, especially with the large screen and text-to-speech feature. The display will adjust day/night automatically.Pro:1. 4\" display, looks beautiful, solid built.2. It's very easy to use.3. Speech is clear.4. Re-routing is very quick (usually takes 5-6 seconds).5. You can do navigation and listen to music at the same time.6. It's not too difficult to learn all the features.7. Long battery life (I think it's 5 hours).Con:1. The initial search for GPS signal is very slow, up to several minutes.2. I turned on all the POI but I don't see them all the time. Most of the time, the unit will tell me turn on which street and then tell me to turn right or left to a ramp but sometimes it tells me to turn left/right after 200 ft. If I set my routing priority to shortest time instead of shortest distance, it will try to get me on the highway even though it is a much longer route.3. I don't know how to get the most updated map...I am sure it does nothave some of the 2007 constructions.4. As someone commented on the older model, GPS-300, the speaker was not good for music. I used the unit to play mp3 songs on a SD card (not included) and it didn't sound good. Yes, it's a HK! It may be good for radio programs or sermons.5. The \"quick user guide\" and the owner's manual on the HK website are the same. They are way too simple. You need to explore the unit for different features. The guide scared me. I thought I need to charge the unit in my car all the time but someone mentioned you can use the USB cable to charge it from a PC. Yes, I tried it but it didn't tell me when it was fully charged.I bought the dash mount unit but this GPS unit cannot be sticked to it tight. The unit will move a little bit at a time but it will not fall out from the dash mount.I am still ok with the unit but I didn't focus too much on the mp3 feature and tried TomTom.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Great sound for the price, but with a couple of nits to pick", "body": "I recently bought a new LG video system: a 47LM7600 3D Smart HDTV, a BP620 Blueray player, and the NB3520A Sound Bar & Subwoofer.  Overall, I am very happy with everything.  But, related to the Sound Bar, I have a couple of nits to pick.First, the praise... The Sound Bar system produces excellent audio, especially for movies where I prefer to crank it up a bit.  That, alone would rate it 5 stars based on quality of audio versus price.The first nit is that the volume control does not pair with the HDTV remote's volume control.  There are a variety of solutions for that.  For example, I have a universal remote that \"locks\" its volume control to the Sound Bar.  But LG should have integrated the functionality and not require me to acquire and program a third-party remote for that.The second nit is that there is no return-feed to the TV so that sound bar settings can be integrated with the TV settings menus.  This is especially egregious when I consider how well the TV and non-LG cable controller (Motorola, from Verizon FiOS) are integrated.If this was an assemblage of multiple vendors' products, I could better understand the lack of integration and the need for a third-party universal remote.Not to over-value these issues, I'm knocking-off one star from the rating.  So it's four stars.UPDATE 8/24/12I also posted this review on the LG site.  It was rejected for not following their \"guidelines\", even though it does.

Did they even try it out in the field?This is NOT a travel bag but one to take just your camera and a couple of small things for a few hours out in the field.It does not hang well more like dangling on the lower back with no waist straps to help support it.The flaps over the memory storage are a waste. I have no idea why bag mfrs even go to the trouble of putting memory slots in the bag. They aren't convenient.Most of us have pretty good sized tripods that aren't going to be carried by this thing.I store most of my equipment in a backpack: camera, 2 extra lenses, flashes, filters, etc. I also have a Kata Torso pack that will fit to the side or in front and will easily hold my camera and an extra lens or couple of flashes and batteries (unfortunately Amazon doesn't carry it any more).  With the Kata bag I can easily get to my camera not having to take off my backpack every time. But my Kata bag could use a couple of large pockets which is why I wanted this Case Logic.The bottom line: If your going out for a walk and want to take just your camera, wallet and cell phone this bag could work.  But if you are out to really take some photos this bag falls short.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Moshi iVisor AG Screen Protector - Good Glare Reduction, Diminished Reading Clarity", "body": "TheMoshi iVisor AG Anti-Glare Screen Protection for Kindle Fire (does not fit HD models) - Bubble Free Installationprovides a nice layer of screen protection with reduced glare for the original Kindle Fire.  It also provides smudge resistance so you don't have to clean your screen as often.  The Kindle Fire is made with Gorilla Glass, so scratch protection is less of a concern.  But added protection never hurts.This reduces enough glare to make the Kindle readable in bright rooms or outdoors in the shade.  It will not allow you to comfortably read your Kindle Fire in direct sunlight.  The trade-off is diminished clarity when reading.  To compensate for this, I have turned up the brightness from the 50% that used to be perfect for reading to about 80%.  That will undoubtedly give me less battery life for reading, but it's worth it to be able to read more easily in bright rooms.  Enlarging the font is also an option.PROS++ Thick screen protector Provides decent screen protection++ Reduces glare enough to make the Kindle Fire readable in bright rooms or outdoors in the shade++ Can easily be cleaned and reapplied, so it will last longer than most alternatives++ Installs without any bubbles++ Adheres very solidly to the screen++ Smudge resistant so you won't have to clean the screen as often++ Includes a high quality micro-fiber cleaning clothCONS-- Reduces contrast and clarity of text while reading, so ....-- You must turn up your Kindle Fire brightness, reducing your battery life-- Does not reduce glare enough to allow for reading in direct sunlight-- Attracts dust particles, though it is very easy to clean them off-- Costly compared to thin film screen protectors-- Only includes 1 protectorUnlike many thin film screen protectors, this one installs without any bubbles.  Perfect installation requires you to place the protector inside of a small fringe border around the screen. If you have part of the protector on that border, it will not lay completely flat on the screen. Taking the time to line up the protector will allow all the edges to adhere flat against the screen.CONCLUSIONThis product comes at a premium, and it only includes 1 screen protector when others include 3.  But it is thick and durable, and can easily be cleaned and re-applied.  So this is one case where the premium may be justified for a screen protector.  Just be aware that you have to turn up the brightness, and you may need to enlarge the font size for reading.Enjoy.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "A620 the new A95??", "body": "I just wanted to say one thing about this camera.  I do believe canon did a great job following up on the A95.  However, what i am very dissapointed in is the construction of the camera.  Notice that most digi camera under 250.00 do not offer 7 Megapixles.  that is reserved for the higher priced cameras.  The reason canon was able to do this is simply in the body construction.  PLASTIC - and alot of it.  Its flimsy feeling plastic.  the A95 had a much more sturdy feel than the A620 especially in the pop out LCD.  the cover for the ports on the camera (USB, Power...) is very poorly designed.  Its a rubber/plastic type piece that is made to fit over the ports but never seems to want to stay - theres no latch or way to secure it.  The A95 had the ports scattered all over the camera, which I liked, it allowed me to have more than one cord plugged into the camera without trying to shove them into one small space all together.  the rubber piece covering the A95's ports were alot more effective.  I have No idea why they decided to go with the SD memory type instead of sticking with the compact flash.  that just boggles my mind.  Anyhow...Performance wise the A620 reminds me very much of the A95.  the menus are familiar and the options are a plenty.  I like being able to control how the camera focuses, where it focuses and the grip/LCD combo makes it easy to take interesting angle shots where as other cameras have the LCD fixed on the back of the camera (how are you going to take that myspace picture without a mirror or flip around LCD screen...HMMm???).  The image quality is what you'd expect.  Im not sure if the images Look Better but u can certainly zoom closer into them without getting any pixles.  I would say it hosts about the same amount of colors.  speaking of colors..the \"my colors\" option on the camera is pretty neat.  Change any color to another or accent any color you want.  Now you can also set your own white balance (an advanced feature only enthusiests would want to use)...im tired..i have nothing else to say...If you are an enthusiest with a very limited budget I wouldnt look further than this camera.  theres no two ways about it.  its an amazing price for a VERY versitile camera (most digi's arent even this versatile untill you get to the SLR range.)", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Could have been great but for spotty traffic signals - great voice command feature", "body": "I've driven with a GPS in the car for over a decade now. I find it very convenient to have it set up every time I go anywhere, even in areas I know, so that I can easily re-route if there is a road blockage, or to use the point of interest feature if I need to find something quickly. I also have come to rely on the traffic information since moving further away from work. Although my drive in good traffic is about thirty minutes, it can easily turn into one - two hours if there are any incidents on the interstate between my home and office.I chose the Garmin n&uuml;vi 3590LMT 5-Inch Portable Bluetooth GPS Navigator with Lifetime Map and 3D Traffic Updates because it could connect to my Android smartphone to provide me with weather information and traffic cameras (both for an annual subscription fee), it had lifetime map updates, and it came with traffic service at no extra charge. Although a little pricier than the GPS devices I've purchased in the past, it was worth it to me to get those features.Having used it since September 2012 now, I can say that while it is a good GPS, it is not worth the price I paid for it. The traffic feature that comes with it works perhaps one-third of the time at best. I live and work in a Metropolitan area where my previous GPS devices had no trouble getting traffic information. This one, however, only gets it in certain areas. I can rarely get a signal on the traffic receiver anywhere in the Nashville, TN area although I have tried resetting the traffic provider data multiple times, applied the latest software updates to the device, etc.That said, it is otherwise a great device. The mapping works very well - I've not had it miscalculate a route yet. When it does get a traffic signal, it works well to provide alternate routes if there is a traffic problem on your way. The GPS route is easy to look at and gives clear vocal instructions as well.The feature that most surprised me is the voice command feature. This is almost perfect. I love that I can easily find addresses using the POI feature, my saved places, and more without taking my hands off the steering wheel or my eyes off the road. The only problem I have had with it is that it just won't work when it is raining. It seems to be the sound of the rain that affects it, since it fails even if I turn the windshield wipers off momentarily. It has no problem hearing me over the radio, but doesn't like the rain at all. Another suggestion I have for Garmin to improve the voice command feature is to enable it for more commands. While you can do most searches with it, it would be nice to be able to perform any command possible on the GPS with voice. The most glaring omission for me is that you cannot access any of the traffic features with voice commands.Software and map updates are easy to do with the provided cable. They seem to provide updates as frequently as they deem necessary rather than a quarterly schedule, which I appreciate. Some other brands provide updates only at set intervals. You can also download extra cars and voices for free.This is a very good GPS and if you don't need to rely on the traffic feature, I'd recommend it. I would not recommend this GPS to anyone who needs a consistent traffic signal.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "You will either love it or hate it", "body": "I like it, but I'll tell you why my wife hates it.You cannot simply open and fold like a laptop. It is some sort of transformer contraption that you will either love or hate. She hates it! But the thing that she hates the most is the opening aspect. When it's folded, it is actually clipped into place. This is very hard to articulate, but here goes.. there is a notch cut out on the keyboard, so when you fold it up, the clip fits nicely into this notch and is completely recessed. There was no design into how to easily open it. What do you do when things are shut tight with no designed mechanism to free it? The answer is you pry it open! This wasn't a big deal to me, you just pry one of the corners. Or, you can dig your fingers in the seam to pry it open. Going from the smart cover, my wife really hates this prying thing. She feels like here finger nails will scratch her Ipad inside. So the best way to open it is to use two hands and target one corner to pry it open. But watching my wife open this thing, I can see why people with small hands may hate it. She has to brace the whole thing against her tummy, or her elbows are tucked in with her arms supporting it while her fingers are prying. It's not a pretty site. But I see it as a non issue because most of the time, you'll be opening in bed, or while you're sitting at a desk in which case you can use the desk or bed for support.Now once it's open, you're presented with a contraption that will feel awkward at first, but once you get used to it, you'll think it's cool. At least, I think the guys will think it's cool. Once again, my wife is like what the heck is this ugly thing? Your Ipad is not immediately supported once open. It is protected in the case, it just can't stand on it's own yet. You'll need to slide out a hidden rail. The Ipad can rotate and stand vertically or horizontally. If you look at the product pictures, you'll see the silver circle on the case. That circle is where all the actions at, it allows you to pivot/rotate, and honestly by the looks of it, it will probably break during your ownership.Some people are saying the Bluetooth disconnects when you close it, and it's true. Once the Ipad goes to sleep, it disconnects. But it's not a hassle as some of them make it out to be. You DO NOT need to go back into your settings and pair it again. The keyboard has an on/off switch. So all you need to do is turn it off, then turn it on again and your Ipad will connect automatically. Anyway, you should turn off the keyboard when you close it. I mean you want to conserve its battery after all, right? Why are people closing this thing and not turning off their keyboard?I like it, my wife hates it. That's why I came to the conclusion that you will either love it or hate it. LOL!", "rating": "mixed"}

That virtually guarantees that the lens and its apertures get separated, leading to frustration. The irony is that the cheap cloth bag that comes with the lens works much better, as it has flexibility to stash the tool inside as well.I suppose if you primarily use the Zone Plate / Pinhole optic, that wouldn't be a big concern.Also, there's no clip or fastener for easily connecting to a camera bag; not a big deal but that'd be nice.Bottom line is: Lensbaby has the opportunity to make a unique case designed for their product, and this isn't.

{"title": "Clamp: 3 stars.  Arm: 5 stars.  Very srtong.", "body": "I bought one of these and it worked great.  Strong enough to hold my 7\" LCD monitor with no fear for falling.  Just make sure to position it so the weight twists the frame to the right.  If you do it to the left it can unscrew itself under force.  The clamp is aluminum and prone to stripping if you tighten the nut too much. I decided to buy another one.  This one arrived with the tightening nut seized in the clamp and the plastic around the head would not grip the nut tight enough to get the screw out.  I was able to cut the plastic off the nuthead and fortunately is is just an Allen nut.  Actually, all you have to do is drill-out the plastic at the end of the nut to reveal the Allen head.  When I took it out, it appears that the hole was not threaded properly or deep enough and it had destroyed the nut when it was put together at the factory (OR...someone bought it, screwed it up, and returned it.)  The original nut was 5mm.  I re-tapped the hole for a no.12 nut.  That solved the problem and it works great just like the first one.  I could have returned it and asked for a replacement. But with a 50% success rate so far, I decided to take 10 minutes and fix it myself.  Just passing this along for any of you that have similar problems and need a quick solution.

It would freeze on the intro, freeze when browsing through the home screen, freeze when downloading games, freeze when loading a game, etc.Looking at other reviews this drive is definitely a gamble, as with most drives.I don't think I would gamble again on this drive for the PS3 because it isn't that much faster than the stock drive that comes with the PS3.

{"title": "Pretty good but overpriced", "body": "This turntable works fine for converting vinyl records to mp3 or other preferred digital formats. However there are a few things that keep it from being a 4 or 5 star product.1. The assembly. The mechanics of this turntable are very basic. I still have a 30 year old Denon turntable that has superior construction to this. It seems that when CDs took over the music business that there was not much call to build turntables any more so all you can get now are basic units. At any rate, this turntable comes with a leather covered top, which is nice but odd. I would have preferred acrylic so I can lower the lid while the record is playing. If you do that here you can't tell what's going on. Also, you have to loop the rubber drive belt around the motor spindle. The belt comes attached to the platter, similar to a gasket. You have to pull the belt away from the platter and drop it over the drive spindle. I couldn't believe I had to do that or that the belt is exposed when you play. I've owned numerous turntables in my time and the belt has always been within the motor housing. The belt is flush against the platter and is made of rubber so you have to be very careful in pulling it away from the platter so you can loop it around the spindle. I used a bent paper clip to get behind it to minimize the risk of tearing the belt and this seemed to work fine.2. The software. The software that comes with this turntable is called Vinyl Recorder. It works ok but has 2 problems. First, it's only a 30 day trial version so if you want to keep using it you have to pay after the expiration. This struck me as a rip off. Had I paid for the turntable I would have expected a software version that at least worked well enough for me to use the turntable without shelling out more bucks. I installed Audacity, a superior, and free, piece of software. Also, when I used Vinyl Recorder to rip from my records I had to find the correct setting for the record to play through the speakers while I was ripping it. When I switched back to listening to music through iTunes, it wouldn't work. I had to disconnect the turntable from the USB port to resolve this. Might be just my system but worth mentioning.3. The price. I did not pay for this turntable, having received it through Amazon Vine. However, if I were looking for a turntable to rip my vinyl records I'd pass on this as too expensive. I think for what you get a reasonable price is about 25% of what it's listed for. Again, that's just my opinion but the simplicty of the materials and basic functionality of the item don't warrant the listed price.", "rating": "mixed"}

I appreciate this. The Noise Isolation is amazing. I really love this product. I purchased two of them now. (and three extra cables&#8230;)There is also oxidation of the coper connections that has been a problem (Why i purchased my second pair earphones). Not a huge problem and it would be due to my location, sweat, and how much i use them. Sometimes i have to 'clean' them but again, not a huge problem.The soft in-ear parts last way longer that i would have guessed. They are very soft and my first guess was that they tear or wear, but it takes many months of use before they start to wear at all. Love this aspect of the earphones. Very comfy. IMO this is really 60% of the reason I own this earphones and love them so much.So - here is where it all goes wrong - the cable will fray and split on you. Im very, very careful with them and they still start to come apart after a few months. They last for me (splitting for months) for not longer than a year. For over half a year i have worn them falling apart knowing that if i replace them it will be a few months until its right back to splitting.The slow death of the cable is really annoying and i won't be replacing this beloved headset due to it.

Yeah, it plays DVD, BD and streams from internet content providers (Netflix, Amazon, etc.) just fine.Edit - btw, if you are an audio enthusiastic and are picking this up to be a universal player, be aware that it does not support DVD-A playback.

It has very nice blue lighting when you turn it on all around the dial.4) Plays SHUFFLE well, a feature which lesser players always are lacking in.5) the builtin CLIP is an awesome plus.  You can just clip it to your shirt or pants, or whatever else turns you on, in case you are short on pockets.6) very low footprint.  its about one inch wide, just under 2 inches long and maybea third of an inch deep with the clip.7) has a builtin rechargeable battery, rated to play 15 hours between charges and seems to fully charge in roughly 3 hours.  Haven't had it long enough yet to comment on the battery, other than to say this is far preferable to using AAs.8) superb sound9) turns on and off QUICKLY (2 secs max).  you may wonder why i mention this, but my prior piece of garbage MP3 player took 30 seconds+ to turn on or off.10) The firmware is absurdly simple to upgrade via the SANDISK website.11) The clip is easily REMOVABLE, which makes the player lighter and thinner if you don't need to clip it.CONS:1) the on/off button is my least favorite sliding type.  I far prefer the on/off design of the slightly pricier SONY WALKMAN2) 2 GIGS is too small if you have a LOT of music (you'll fit roughly 400 songs)3) The battery doesn't last all that long and the indicator of how much is left leaves a lot to be desired - I'd prefer if it showed minutes remaining until death, but all you get is a segmented bar which isn't all that accurate.Worst drawback of all is if you fully charge the battery, then do not use the player for a week or 2, you will find the battery DEAD when you next want to use it.  It seems to burn battery slowly even when turned off.4) You'd think it's simple, just plug into USB port and use filer manage to copy your songs, BUT there's a really complicated trick they mention NOWHERE in the manual that WINDOWS can see this device as either MTP or MSC, and if you copy files to it in MTP mode, then the next connection sees it as MSC, all your files will seem to vanish.  Make sure you DO NOT install the MTP driver unless you require it for Rhapsody or some other nonsense.  Stay in MSC mode and file management will be much easier, but this should definitely be made very clear up front in the manual, and it is not.OVERALL: If you enjoy wasting money, buy an IPOD - if you enjoy a quality product at a great price, buy a SONY WALKMAN.The SONY is IN A CLASS BY ITSELF.  If you want the best buy the SONY NWZE354 Walkman.  But the SANSA is $20 less expensive and a winner in its own right if you can tolerate the battery issues.In my mind it is worth the extra $20 to hold 4 times the music and have a superior interface with a best in universe 50 hour battery - you be the judge.

{"title": "Improved display, worse navigation", "body": "This product will definitely get you there.  It costs much less than the Garmin nuvi 350 that cost  me $278 six years ago.  The LCD display is much better, high resolution and helpful at showing the correct path at complex interchanges. And it  includes free map updates.But the navigation is noticeably inferior to the Garmin nuvi 350, or the TomTom XXL 540TM that I  bought 4 years  ago.The way I judge efficiency of a  GPS is by asking it to navigate local roads that I know  very well, to see whether it comes up with the most efficient route.  This GPS does poorly  with this.  For example, when I asked it to take me from my home to a destination seven miles away,  and I started taking some back roads, it kept telling me to revert to my original route, even  though this would have been substantially slower.  In other words, if you deviate from the original route, it just tells you to go back to that route, rather than recalculating and finding the most efficient route from your current position.Another way of judging a navigator is how well it predicts travel time. In this respect this GPS  is seriously deficient.  For example, on a recent journey late at night with very light traffic  and no obstructions, it started out predicting 19 minutes and ultimately the journey took 26  minutes, even though I was exceeding the speed limit most of the time and there were no holdups.  This is what it usually does.  My 6 year old GPS, on the other hand, is usually within a minute or  two for short trips, and within 3 or 4 minutes for longer journeys in excess of 50 miles.  If you are like me, and phone  ahead if I am going to be late for an important appointment, this is a real defect.So, I am giving this product 3 stars, because it is significantly worse at navigating than older  navigators that I own, even though it will get you there eventually.I bought this product  because my nuvi 350 maps are increasingly out of date. But I am returning this product and looking  for a GPS that is good at recalculating efficiently if I take a wrong turn or deliberately deviate from the initially chosen route.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Don't know what the big deal is!", "body": "I have owned this for about 2 weeks now and maybe watched netflix on it ONE evening. The thing I was very disappointed about was the fact the unit's software is computer dependant. In other words, most of the apps have to be registered via laptop or desktop computer by entering and code on the computer to activate the software on the unit. You have to do this for almost every peice of software it comes installed with. I find this to be a pain. I bought the unit hoping it would be a better alternative to the media streaming unit I currently own. Alas, it is NOT. I have found there seems to be media streaming software that you can download from the ROKU store but out of the two packages I tried, I had to go through all this registration and code setting in order to get it work. One software I couldn't figure it out at all. The other I sort of got to work but neither offered a point and click solution on the computer to find network directories on your network to play videos or music or photos from. One has to remember what the exact network path is in order to get the software to find the files and play them back. I felt it streamed Netflix alright as well as Amazon video and Crackle. But in the world of streaming video, my idea is to be able to keep a library of backed up DVD's on a hard drive so I never have to put in the actual disk and it remains safe from scratches and such abuse. If I want to be able to play back a movie, then I just have to find it on my NAS drive and itiate playback. I was hoping the ROKU would've accomplished this for me but it doesn't. So now I have to keep the other media streamer hooked up that is designed to play back ALL types of video files including DVD VOB files, and I have this player and the ROKU hooked up via an HDMI switch. But what a bummer that is. There are many players out there that are NOT compatible to playback VOB files. These companies think that the only type of video file are ones such as MP4 and WMA and AVI...etc. If a company wants to create a winning streaming player, they really need to consider being able to play back ALL types of popular video formats such as DVD files also for those keeping extensive DVD libraries on their large hard drives.Another point I wanted to make about this player, is the movies that are streamed, such as those from Netflix or the Amazon Store, do not play back in 5.1 surround. The streaming quality has to be at a lower bit rate in order to be effective enough and watchable enough to stream over the internet. This also is disappionting. At least with my other player, it will also play back the original 5.1 surround sound.I would not refer this product to another person.

{"title": "Best thing available, but not great", "body": "Bought these a few months ago from a retail store.  I had previously purchased (and still have/use) the Sony Ericcson MW600 bluetooth, but I opted for this set because I found the cord very annoying during runs.  (The Sony basically is a clip that you can plug any pair of ear buds into).  The price point was a bit high, but I thought it would be worth it.  Unfortunately, I have found the weight and angle that these fit into your ear canal almost equally annoying.  Even with the new ear cushions, the fit on these is just not optimal.  Let me explain:  The plastic cord that connects the two units is very inflexible and flaps up and down when I run, so I've used a clip to pin it up in my hair.  Doing this, however, misaligns the natural angle these are supposed to fit into your ear, causing them to constantly slip out even with the ear cushions.  Bear in mind though, that even without clipping them up this, the angle that these are supposed to fit into your ear would suggest the cord actually fall in front of--not behind--your head.  That would be just as annoying as a standard wired headset.  Because these are very heavy, misaligning the angle even a little bit makes it so the cushions don't work as well.  This may sound nit-picky, but if you look at the photo on the website, it makes it appear that the headset should be perfectly perpendicular to your body.  In reality, it never stays that way when you run.  The ear cushions do not come in a size small enough to remain in my ear (I guess I have small ears?), so while it is good in theory, it hasn't worked for me.  The sound controls are also so small and difficult to press (probably to ensure the sweat-proof seal) that they are not really usable during a run.  It would also have been nice if the unit offered the ability to change tracks, but I don't think that is an option from what I read in the specs.Fit issues aside, the quality of the set is excellent.  It has lived up to the sweat-proof warranty so far with  good sound quality and decent bass.  If I could get them to consistently stay in my ear during long runs, I'd be able to rate them higher.Overall, I haven't found anything else on the market that has anywhere near the quality and features that this set has, so I'm inclined to go ahead and settle on these for now.  Hopefully, the upcoming holiday season will result in some better options becoming available.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "The hard set-up", "body": "Man, I thought getting the Buffalo N600 HighPower Gigabit Dual Band router would be great.Unboxing the unit was pretty easy.  The hardest part was taking the cling wrap material off the unit.  The base snaps on to the N600 easily allowing it to stand up.  One complaint though is the power cable is SHORT.  I mean really short.  The LinkSys unit this replaces had a much longer cable which allowed me to put the unit further back on the shelf.Now to setup.  I don't know about you but I don't like setting up these things via applications.  A good web browser is all one should need to configure a unit.  There are where my problems started.Most routers/gateway/switches available for home use have an IP address of 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1.  Buffalo is different.  This being my first Buffalo unit I did not know this.  The N600's IP address is 192.168.11.1.  The forced me to change the IP address of my computer to use 192.168.11 and not my standard IP address.Next came the web interface.  There is this area on the first screen called the Setup Card.  I missed the prompt wanting me to change the admin login name and password.  That is what I get for not fully reading the alerts.  The first alert shown is a box to change the admin name and admin password.After struggling for sometime, I got the N600 configured, changed the SSID and wireless passwords and then went to change the default admin name and password.  Here is where another mistake was made.  I prefer my routers to not have a login name.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the old LinkSys units my husband and I have had over the years.  We just enter the admin password and leave the user name blank.  So that is what I attempted to do.Regrettably the Buffalo N600 saved it, or it saved something.  It really is hard to know because after I told the N600 to reboot I was locked out.Dang!While I still had network connectivity, I could not get back in to the N600 to make any configuration changes.  Now I had to find how to reset the N600 back to factory defaults.  So I put the disk that came with the N600 in the drive and searched for \"reset.\"  Finding it, I find a long, thin rod to press the reset button on the bottom of the router and started over.Everything is easier and faster the second time you do it.  That is true for setting up the N600.  Then the N600 locked up.For several minutes I struggled to re-gain access to the admin pages of the N600 before finally unplugging the unit and letting it reset.All in all, the N600 has been a problem child to setup.  Maybe, again, it is me and my previous history with LinkSys.  But we also have a D-Link which is our primary router.  It was easier to setup and configure than the Buffalo N600 has been.  The edge for the N600 is the fact it is a dual band wireless access point so my wireless devices that can use it, read 802.11N devices, can get data faster.But the trusty and faithful LinkSys WRT54G is not going anywhere.  It may well be pressed back in to service.To give the N600 an honest shake, it is highly configurable and comes with the DD-WRT firmware installed.  On the disk you can install the Buffalo firmware.  There is even a window to run commands directly on the N600.  For me, and for most users, this is just more than we want or need.  What we need is a secure unit that is easy to setup and operate.  If you are a gamer or serious tinkerer, then the N600 may be for you.WARNING:  Antennas on this router are pop-ups and the top is vented, so you cannot put anything on top. If you have small children or pets, this could be a problem.Rebecca McFarland Kyle, October 2012", "rating": "mixed"}

It is awkward to accomplish detailed moves.  To me, pointing with my fore or middle finger is more natural than the thumb, and after all what are you doing with the cursor, but pointing with it?I was hoping to be able to get used to this trackball,and gave it 3 days....but no go.  It may be the perfect mouse for some people, but not me.THE UGLY: This is the first REAL updated wireless trackball from Logitech in YEARS.  And what do they do? Update the tech of an OLD design, and not their most popular trackball design either. Logitech has 2 wireless trackball models, and form hasn't been updated on either since XP days. I would settle for an updated Cordless Optical Trackman (my current fav)with unified receiver and improved tracking, but I would LOVE something NEW. The trackball market is a loyal one...there are OLD OOP trackballs selling on that auction site for $200+.Logitech gets around $50+ for each of their 2 wireless trackballs, but evidently feels no need to come up with anything new for their loyal trackball customers. We get dozens of new mice....but the same ol trackball stock.  I would have to add that Logitech's driver support is sorry to say the least (it took a solid year for a Win 7 version of Setpoint), and longevity has always been an issue. I have to replace my Logitech trackball every year or two.

{"title": "Big sound, but has some issues", "body": "First of all, let me say that I'm guessing I got a faulty unit or something because when I feed it a Dolby Digital signal, it makes this horrible crackling and popping sound.  As soon as I send it just a standard stereo signal, it sounds great.  I'm using this downstairs in my game room with my Xbox and so I don't really need surround sound like I would for a movie, so it's not a big enough deal for me to go through the hassle of returning it.  I will say that it more than fills the room with plenty of rich sound--MUCH better than the TV speakers could ever do and without all the bulk of a receiver and satellite speakers.  I've also fed it some bass tracks as a test and this unit held its own very well.  Having said that, though, you're going to get a much better surround experience from real surround speakers.  In fairness, I'm not feeding this a 5.1 signal (because I can't for the reason listed above) but even with stereo sound, I'm not really getting the amount of auditory spacial perception you would expect with the real thing.  No surprise there.ALSO, the remote is super finicky.  I've found that it often doesn't work until I shake it or open it up and jiggle the batteries around.  Loose connection, or something.  That's a little annoying but once again, I can usually just set the volume I want and call it good, so it's not enough for me to deal with the hassle of boxing it back up and taking it to a delivery store (UPS, FedEx, etc.).If I thought these problems were likely to be common for all of these units, I'd give it 2 stars.  It deserves at least that even with the annoyances because it does sound very good in stereo mode for the price listed.  I am convinced, however, that I got a bad unit and they don't all do this; I could be wrong, but it seems like such a blaring problem that they would have noticed and fixed it before shipping if it was the norm.  On the other hand, I can't rate it higher than 3 given my personal experience with it.Personally, I prefer the sound that actual surround speakers provide, so if you have the space and budget, I'd totally recommend you do that instead.  On the other hand, if you don't have the space and/or don't want to run a bunch of wires all over, then you might consider an option such as this.  The sound won't be AS good, but it isn't bad.  If you want a nice, quick, easy set up with all the wires you will need provided in the kit (which this has) and if money is an issue AND if you are willing to play the return game if your unit is acting weird, then I'd recommend product.  The sound is big, rich and full and I think for the vast majority of users who do not already have a full surround sound system, it will be more than good enough.Now that I think about it, I think this would make a really good unit for users who want just music in a single room and have a place the can put both the bar and the sub.

{"title": "Good looking case not without drawbacks", "body": "This attractive red case is well made and it does the job of protecting your Kindle Fire HD.  It looks good, I'd go so far as to call it eye-catching.  The stitching is neat and even and it's nicely padded to absorb those inevitable knocks and jolts.  It has 4 silicone-enhanced elastic straps to hold the Kindle in place without interfering with the operating buttons and a pocket on the inside to keep notes or business cards.  In short, it's a lovely case.Now come the \"buts\".  There is no closure mechanism on the case.  Short of inelegantly wrapping an elastic band around it to secure it, there is no way to insure that the Verso case will remain closed while in your purse or backpack.  Next, it doesn't work well as a stand, critical when you want to read or watch audio hands-free.  I tried it a few times and it just flopped down each time.  And finally, and perhaps most importantly, those elastic straps.  While there's nothing inherently wrong with them and they do allow the case to be used for devices other than the Kindle Fire HD, they aren't the best or most secure solution.  Perhaps the fact that Lightwedge has designed the case to fit multiple devices is actually part of the problem.  Those cases which are engineered for one specific product are able to customize the fit so the tablet may slip into the case like a glove without the need for straps to hold it in.  The Amazon Kindle Fire HD Standing Leather Case (which I also own) is one of these.  The Kindle just fits tightly and securely inside its shell and stays there even when turned upside down.  The Amazon case also addresses the other issues that I have with this case.

{"title": "Great picture and looks, poor user interface", "body": "Lets start with the good about this 55 inch LCD set: This is a great looking TV that comes with an elegant base that emphasizes its sleek and thin design. The very thin frame makes it look smaller than it is.The picture quality is excellent: crisp and sharp with a good viewing angle. LED dimming creates strong contrasts. Digital image processing magic enhances motion blur and contrast. This works well without much noticeable side effects.The 3D picture is great, popping right out of the frame. The included 3D glasses are flimsy, but the lightness makes them easy to wear. The 3D blueray player that came with the set is decent, and the supplied animated 3D movies are a blast to watch. There is a 2D to 3D up conversion that is better than I expected. Still you'll probably not use that feature for non-3D content once the novelty wears off. 3D glasses are just not cool enough....I suspect that in practice, 98% of the use of 3D TVs will be regular 2D content. Though nice, the experience is just not comfortable enough for daily use. Apart from the inconvenience of having to wear them, the active shutter glasses create a slight flicker effect. Since the frame rate is effectively cut in half fast objects move noticeably more jerky.Electrical power consumption is very low which can be felt since the set barely warms up after use. This a a huge contrast from the hot 50\" plasma that it replaced. This is  the coolest and most energy efficient TV I looked at in nearly half a century.But this great TV has a number of annoying flaws as well.First, the set I received developed a manufacturing defect in the LCD after just 30 minutes of use, which does not bode well for Samsung's quality assurance. Suddenly a full line of pixels is stuck on. Amazon was quick in sending replacement set. Lest hope that one with survive the burn-in period.The remote looks OK at first sight, with its full keyboard on the back side. Its wedge shape makes it look like a miniature ladies' purse, riddled with buttons on both sides. In practice, it offers a pretty lousy experience.Where do I start? First, it is simply not responsive. It may take seconds for the menu to respond to a button click. This is the least responsive remote I've ever used in 30 years. It seems that Samsung skimped on the processing power of the embedded processor. Sometimes the 'input select' button must be clicked many times to respond. this is necessary because the set does not automatically switch between HDMI inputs. Typing on the dorky keyboard is a horrific experience: it misses keystrokes, or the key bounces to produce two the same characters. It is no match for the Logitech Google TV that has a great full-sized keyboard.In an age of well designed iPad and cellphone user interfaces, it is mind boggling why a TV that costs 5-10x as much comes with a stone-age user interface that is an illogical mess of tiny buttons. Control is simply not intuitive, and worse, each of the apps uses the buttons in a different way. Loads of buttons that are hardly ever used obfuscate the ones that actually matter.  There are colored buttons that are mysteriously called A B C D. Unbelievable that the Samsung engineers who designed did not walk across the isle to talk to their colleagues who are woking on android phones. Or they could have copied the 12-year old design of the Tivo remote and User Interface.The set comes with an e-manual only, that is slow to access and required many clicks to get some info. Anyway, I did not manage to find out whether the remote can replace the control for the assorted set-top boxes and DVD players that are stacked up next to our TV.3 Buttons scattered over the remove start different collections of built-in apps. They are not much to write home about: clumsy and moving jerky compared to a Tivo or Google TV. The Yahoo 'hotapps' are basic widgets for weather, stock news, etc. Since its so much easier, faster and smoother to get the same information from a smartphone, I predict that they will never be used in practice. There is also a web browser, but the above mentioned problematic tiny keyboard makes it near-useless. By the way: even with a good keyboard (such as the Logitech Google TV), browsing the web on a TV is not something that the average buyer of this TV is likely to do more than once or twice per year.The 'social TV' button mixes a rather basic Facebook interface with a TV picture. I totally fail to see the point of this. Facebook or twitter are individual activities that we do in a corner, in bed or in restrooms, not in front of a huge 55 Inch TV with the rest of the family watching.Many of the above usability argument also apply to all other manufacturers of TVs. Fortunately, the main thing we with the the TV is to switch it on or off, as most other contents comes from settop boxes. Once on, this Samsung TV is among the best, mixing good styling with a good picture.", "rating": "mixed"}

It's audible when the car is quiet but a highway speeds it is sometimes tough to discern what she is saying.Re-routes are not the most logical(if you are familiar with the area-Common GPS problem)Overall, this GPS is a good value.  It is easy to use right out of the box and has enough features and upgradeability for the seasoned driver.  If you don't need Bluetooth Cell Phone features or a built in MP3/Photo viewer, this definitely fits the bill.  With software updates this product should keep growing.", "rating": "mixed"}

Packaging is in a clear see through hard plastic case which I do not like as much as ipod packaging.That leads to the biggest problem with this player.  If you use iTunes to manage your music this is probably not the player for you.  I use iTunes to manage most of my music and this will not sync with iTunes, as one would expect since it's not an iPod.  I'm just putting this out there as I know there are people who just assume any old MP3 player will sync with iTunes.  I have downloaded a few songs from Amazon.com and using the included software I have no real problems getting the MP3 files on the GoGear.  I swapped out the stock earbuds for a pair of ultimate ears I have and the sound quality is right on par with an iPod.

{"title": "GPS 315 good but has big problems", "body": "I purchased the GPS 315 in December after using another brand for five years. The GPS315 represents a big improvement with better, quicker satelite acquistion, a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user  to use the sun or moon to  correct bearing. This way the user is not having  to pull out a compass to check bearing. Additional pluses are its small  size and light weight using only two AA batteries lasting up to 15 hours.  If weight is a concern, that is big. My previous unit used four and lasted  five hours. Problems: The manual is as sorry as it can get. It barely  covers TrackRoute, Track History, Backtrack, and Reverse Route. These are  major important features left to the user to figure out. I have yet to  figure them out consistently. With Track History there seems to be an  ability to set a scale, but what scale? Nothing tells me. Is it how often  it records a waypoint in history?I have emailed the company with  questions twice, called once (had to leave a voice mail because they were  not taking calls), faxed once. Heard nothing from their customer  no-service. I wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts. Oh yes, my GPS  315 crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old.  Glad I wasn't in the middle of 40,000 acres. You can't zoom in on a  waypoint if it is very far away from your current location.

Unit was also shipped with Microsoft Office and AntiVirus software (long out of date, but it did update itself on 2nd use --- 2nd use because of hardware component failure.)  Item was shipped with caveat that battery was &#34;feet up&#34;, but the battery holds a charge, just that it SOMETIMES doesn't transfer energy to the motherboard (but sometimes, it does).  Ditto the internal NIC card.  It was NOT listed as defective, and (as a matter of fact) presented as fully functional.  Well, it worked the first time, and failed thereafter.  I had to purchase and use a USB adapter to access the Internet (after which, the computer sizzled and popped and the NIC card came back on line and remained for a few days before quiting again.  (I found that smacking the laptop a few times would bring the NIC back on line, because when it sizzled and popped, the computer kept re-rebooting during startup. Smacking it, stopped the sizzle/pop and often brought back the NIC (task bar showing operation of the USB adapter [running at 72Mbps] the internal adapter [when it ran, it was only 11Mbps, so commanded to be off when it did run], and the ethernet connector [which also failed when the internal adapter failed --- thus the NIC card seems to be de-laminating from the motherboard).ALSO problem was unit was presented as having a CD/DVD drive.  Uh, not quite --- unit only read CDs (and Device Manager concurred --- is NOT a component failure, but is the type of installed component), so I had to purchase a USB DVD drive to install software too big for flash drives.  Also not mentioned, is power switch is finicky.  Sometimes it works, sometimes, not so much.  Actually, when if fails, it will function if I unplug the AC power cord until it turns on and begins reboot.

It really stands out in the demo room. Also the price range is so much more appealing than Sony's.However it needs some improvement for sure.1) The regular analog channels are almost unbearable to watch due to poor upconverting capability. Same thing happens to my dvd players (yes, I have 4 of them), I just can't stand the picture quality. I observed the picture quality on another brand, which is 720p, the resolution doesn't lose that much.2) This model has 3 picture mode, Dynamic, Standard and Movie. Dynamic is great for the sports but sometimes it gives this sort of white out feeling for the regular programs. Movie is way too dark comparing to the other two modes, the screen turns into this yellow milky color, the day light in movies looks like late afternoon (btw, I tried the combinations posted on the forum for movie mode, sorry, didn't work for me), so I think this mode is useless. Standard is probably the practical one.3) The source list selection (to choose TV, VCR, DVD, set box etc.) is a pain. My friend has a Bravia, he presses one button on remote to show all sources on the screen and pick one to switch. For this Samsung, I either have to press the source list button to go through all possible sources one by one sequentially or press menu->input->source list-> right key-> up or down key several times to pick the source I desire. Okay for me, but probably too difficult for mom and pa!4) The viewing angle is great, but the color is slightly off when not viewing it within 10 degrees or so.5) The built-in speaker is a joke. When I turn it up over 15, it sounds like the speaker is going to crack. Hooked up audio output to my receiver right away, but I feel sorry for people who don't have a stereo system.6) As mentioned in my review for Samsung BD-P1400 blu-ray player, the TV remote can not be programmed to control the blu-ray, which is a shame.Overall I think this is a decent LCD TV for first time buyers, but it could've been better in many ways.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "A nice, simple capture device - but beware of sync issues", "body": "I purchased this after returning the Hauppauge USB Live 2 capture device (I could not get it to work).  I preferred the Hauppauge device because it had some feedback (lights) on the device to indicate that the device was plugged in, and that it was capturing video.The Elgato device does not have any lights for feedback (1 star off for that).  However, once it is working, there is no need for lights, If you see and hear something in the capture software, then the device is plugged in and capturing.The install was not flawless.  I plugged in the device, and loaded the driver and software.  No problems there.  But, when I went to capture, I got a second or so of audio, and that was it.  Well, that was better than the Hauppauge - I didn't get anything there.  But, no video, and blip of audio was not too impressive. I tried a different USB port - Aha, audio and some crappy video.  Still not good, but at least better.  Finally, moved it to yet another USB port.  Bingo - perfect audio and video.  I am not sure what was going on there with different outcomes on different USB ports.  This is a brand new PC, and other devices have worked fine on those same ports.  But, I did find something that worked great, so that is how I will plug it in, in the future.The capture software itself was pretty nice.  A nice sized capture window, and some controls so I can make the capture end after a certain time period (no need to wait around to hit the stop button).In addition, this device works with my video editor software.  I can just do the capture right from there.  Sweet!I played back the captured video, and all looks good.  The video and audio are in sync.  And it looks and sounds good.Bottom line - I am very happy.  4 1/2 stars.Update...After doing several captures, I went back and started working with the captured videos.  That's when I noticed that the audio and video started getting out of sync.  It would start out fine, but over time they got out of sync.  Will probably be fine for captures that are 30 minutes or shorter.  But anything longer than that will probably have noticeable sync issues.  Dropping my rating from 4 1/2 stars down to 3.

{"title": "Poor Viewing Angle", "body": "I purchased this monitor upgrading from an old CRT (18 inch Trinitron from Dell). Because I was going from CRT to LCD and from 4:3 to 16:9, there were a lot of new variables to consider in order to ensure I got a monitor that satisfied me. I studied the specs on a number of monitors in the $200 range, considering models from $180 up  to about $250 and more. I got this model because it looked like a steal. The specs were all there: 2 ms response time, 23 inches of screen real estate, full HD, high contrast ration, you name it. It also got decent reviews online.The trouble is that whenever you buy an item like this entirely online, you are buying based on numbers, word of mouth, and other ultimately unreliable sources of information. You should know upfront that manufacturers use different ways of computing these metrics. For example, you can't compare contrast rations between manufacturers reliably. Such a comparison MIGHT be an indication of a real difference in quality, or it might be meaningless. It's impossible to know. In fact, you can't even compare contrast ratios between models made by the SAME manufacturer from different years! Even if it's the same MODEL! This leaves us consumers in a real pinch. Especially when buying ONLINE.When I got my monitor, I was initially very impressed with the size of the screen. The 16:9 format is really so much better. It's great for movies and it's even better for the extra desktop space. Teamed with Windows 7's nifty windows that snap to the sides of the screen, comparing two browsers or documents is really nice. The vertical height of this screen is about the same as a 19 inch 4:3 monitor. I have to say, I somehow thought this would be bigger, but it seems bigger than it is due to the extra horizontal space. Running in full 1080p is nice, too. The resolution is crisp and beautiful. Colors are fairly good and overall picture quality is good, though not stellar. After testing the monitor on monitor testing sites, I'm not entirely sure how much of a difference the advertised 2ms response time makes. This is another instance where that number may or may not mean much, and testing the monitor is difficult without something to compare it to.But all this is knit-picking. I would be more than happy with this purchase except for one characteristic that just leaves me anxious over whether or not I should return it and try a different model out: VIEWING ANGLE. This model has a very poor viewing angle. Granted, I am coming from a CRT where viewing angle was not really an issue. But looking at the monitor from even just a slightly up or down angle makes a huge difference in contrast, and the horizontal angle seems equally poor. It's not atrociously poor, but poor enough to make me wonder whether or not I can live with it. It is definitely NOT acceptable considering the ADVERTISED viewing angle is 160 degrees v/h (who knows how they came up with that number, but I consider it false advertising). I should also mention that I am writing this review from work on a Samsung SyncMaster 943ewx, and this monitor has a great viewing angle, almost as good as a CRT, so I do have some kind of point of reference. The viewing angle is also worse than any of the three laptops in my home, one of which is around 8 years old! To compound this drawback, the monitor stand does not allow for up and down movement. To adjust it to eye level you will need to put it on a phone book or something. Very unfortunate that one major kink should stand in my way of feeling like I made a smart buy.I highly recommend you go into a store and look at monitors up close before buying. If you cannot do this, then buy two or more models, try them out side by side, keep the one you like the most and return the others. You will be out the return shipping, sure, but it beats having to buy one monitor individually and wonder whether or not it's a good buy and possibly having to pay for return shipping anyway if you're unhappy. At least this way you know you have the monitor you want.

{"title": "Better, but not best... still searching", "body": "I'm no a professional photographer, but I do go on day trips and travel to different countries quite often so I like to capture moments and exotic sites so I guess I would be classified as an enthusiast.  I just put this strap on my D5100 with a battery grip and normally mate it with a 200mm or 300mm lens, sometimes with the 500mm for races and such.The motivation for this purchase is like other customers who have posted; I don't like \"over-the-neck\" straps, since it puts a lot of weight on the back of your neck, especially if there is no padding.  It also makes carrying the camera very awkward, since it makes it look like I have a gun barrel coming out of my belly.  I've switched over to different types of straps that hook the camera on one side, which lets the camera/lens dangle freely and I can easily point the heaviest part (the lens) towards the rear.  The gives me a natural \"grab, lift, and shoot\" motion, like a gun-slinger motion.  After the clasp on the single-point strap snapped and dropping the camera (good thing it was only the stock 55mm lens) and damaging the lens, it was time to get a strap made for photography use.This weekend was a 200mm weekend and I barely felt the weight of the camera at all, so the padding is excellent.  However, having both camera connectors clipped, it was very difficult to take \"instant\" pictures, since the two slider straps tended to bunch together and ride up my nose and I would lose the shot.I started experimenting with keeping the camera tied to one strap or the other.  The \"connectors in the nose\" problem went away for the most part, but clipping the camera to one side or the other has it's own issues, of which is the unclipped pigtail would get in your face.  I suppose if you found which side works better for you, you could remove the unused pigtail.  However, I find the best configuration is to clip the right-side, since I'm right handed, so the strap does not run across the screen and in my face as I'm taking a shot.  This also interfered with my phone which is clipped to my belt, but that's my own issue and nothing to do with the OP/TECH product.I still have more testing to do, but I ended up using this strap as a carry strap.  I would completely disconnect the camera to take my shot and reclip it when I'm done.  That doesn't lend itself well to instant shot photography.", "rating": "mixed"}

The buttons have a very cheap feel to them and any painted markings will rub off almost immediately.4. The clock built into the grip is completely useless and can't keep time for more than one day.That said, the grip is quite functional and makes using the camera in portrait mode much more comfortable as well as extending the camera's battery life.  It's nice to have the intervalometer built in, but if I was going to buy another battery grip for a rebel, I would get one without the LCD screen to save some money and to get the rubber gripping over the entire grip.", "rating": "mixed"}

In my opinion it is way better than the on screen keyboard also.  The mini sits in a swell that has a magnetic feature which is nice...especially when it is in the horizontal position as there is more surface area.  I would not recommend using it vertically as it just doesnt look safe or feel safe.Now for the drawbacks.  This aint for man hands.  The keys are very scrunched in the swell and Ive already had to correct several errors while typing this review.  Then there is where theyve put the apostrophe.  Ridiculous.  So much so, you will see in my review the absence of them since I wasnt going to be bothered with multiple keystrokes to use it.  While this will guard the front of the mini fine, it leaves the back fully exposed.  Not a fan of that.  But that is just a personal preference...i wish it would have fit with my clear clamshell case.The mini snaps firmly into place...there is not doubt about that.  Actually, I dont like how firm it is as you have to (or at least I do) dig your finger/fingernail into the opening and kind of pry it out of this case.  I hate feeling like I could scratch it just by trying to get to it.All in all, Im not really sold on this case.

{"title": "Super bright", "body": "Replaced all the speakers in my 2012 Durango R/T and used these to replace the front tweeters..BE WARNED these are super bright.  Like 10x as bright as my Klipsch horn speakers in my house and loud.  If there is music with a guitar, it will sound like someone has the guitar right up to your ear.  Used the entire GTO line to swap out 6 of the 9 speakers and they sound way better than factory, at volume 24 I'd say its as loud as 30 with the factory system, but these dont sound as \"turned up\" loud.  As in the factory speakers start to sound like an alarm clock radio turned up loud, these should like someone is screaming in your year.With an aftermarket radio where you can control the eq points, these would be great because the mid-rang frequencies need to be booster.  For instance I use to listen to the highs at +3, now at -7 they are still louder than the factory tweeters.  They kinda dont have much tweeter mid-range to them (1k to 5k htz), but I think that will come as the voice coil breaks in.I would give a 4 but its not the speakers, they are what tweeters are suppose to be, used for highs.  My prob is the GTO 6x9's and 6.5's have these loud super high tweeters also.  So a word to the wise, if you use these with other GTO speakers, set the treble on the 6x9's and 6.5's to -3db (the button in on the tweeter for those speakers), or a graphic equalizer, you have to trim the frequencies from 5k to 20k htz.Also just so you know, the factory 6x9's had more bass than the GTO 6x9's, these just sound more clear....but with 1/2 the bass...so if you have a Durango 2011+ i'd leave the Alpine 6x9's in there and replace the center with an Infinity Ref center, and these for tweeters.***Update...just changed my review to 3 starts.  These things are just too bright at over 10k htz.  They dont sound crystal clear, they sound super high pitched.  Like I said I have Klipsch horns that are not this bright, I also grew up playing the flute and know what clear high frequencies should sound like.  These hurt my ears.

{"title": "Great camera...but marred by dark shadowy spot on images.", "body": "The ELPH 110HS is a great little point & shoot camera, it is light and compact and can be tucked away easily but there are a few negatives which I will be pointing out and let me start with the main reason which ultimately ruined this otherwise great little camera. I realized every photo I took with the flash ON emits a dark shadowy patch towards the right-bottom side of the image. If you think this camera takes absolutely great photos, you're right! Pictures with lots of natural lighting and/or outdoor scenes without using the 'flash', yes, but double-check your photos by taking some indoor shots with the flash ON and preferably with lighter backgrounds and you will see what I mean. I didn't think it was a big deal if it didn't hurt the actual images, but all the photos I transferred to my laptop had the problem -- a dark fuzzy, shadowy blotch towards the bottom right! I tried every settings until my thumb got sore from pressing the 'flushed' setting buttons but nothing helped. Then I realized this was caused by the positioning of the flash lens. The Canon had the flash located on the left side of the camera (right side if you're viewing a pic of the product) and when the camera is turned ON, the lens extends and therefore blocking a quarter of the light when the flash is activated. I tried taking a few shots with my left index finger 'doubling' as extending the lens from the Canon and every shot I took with my finger extended, the shadow increases more and more on the bottom-right of the screen. Note that I didn't cover any part of the lens but only slightly blocking a portion of the light from the flash and therefore created this mystery shadow. This further validated my claim and assured of the culprit. The only way to remedy this is to zoomed in the lens a bit.Images looked fabulous when shot outdoors w/o the flash but I noticed that it also inherited some linear distortion and field curvature (barrel effect) on most of my photos, in other words cars looks stretched toward the edges of photos, light poles are bent in, and rounded objects like my wall clock looked oval. I believed most cameras with wide-angle lenses emits this effect. But overall, the camera takes takes more than satisfactory photos. It has great color-balance and very little noise. Close-up viewing (1:1) is still very good without revealing too much noise or artifacts.Regarding the black spot, I am really hoping that this is a defect with the model I received. The camera has been returned and I repurchased another one. I will update the review should there be any noticeable differences or improvement.Cons:1.) The power button: Yes, THE BUTTON (instead of a sliding switch) this causes me to accidentally turned the camera on and off whenever storing or removing from its case. This also happens during removal of the SD card and battery (for charging) vice versa.2.) Menu setting buttons: Works great but they are stiff! Not very easy and doesn't provide much of a tactile feel because they are 'flushed' throughout the panel. My right thumb literally got sore from operating this camera when selecting options or previewing photos.3.) Battery/SD card release cover is flimsy. Sliding it back and forth will certainly grind off the little tabs which will eventually leave it hanging.4.) Zoom (video): Emits a wheezing sound when used rendering your precious materials virtually useless.5.) Battery life: Short!6.) Noticeable Linear Distortion and Field Curvature.Pros:1.) Very compact, light and stylish2.) Wide angle lens3.) Great outdoor photos, or when flash is not in use for indoor photos.4.) Night shots are very good and retaining rich colors such as red.5.) Great HD Video with Stereo recording6.) Separate/external battery charger (can also be charge from computer by using the same USB cable, but much slower).7.) Handles great during low-light situations", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Not bad, not great", "body": "I reviewed the SBX8 a few months back, and this SBX10 isn't much of an upgrade.  Not that it's a bad thing, but you'd expect some noticeable difference between the two products.  The biggest difference is the bluetooth data rate, but personally I can't notice much of a difference.  For the price, I'd recommend picking up the SBX8 as it's pretty much the same speaker.This is made for accompaniment to a lap top, and for the most part, it delivers. I use this with a Macbook Pro, and while the standard speakers that come with it aren't bad at all, this Creative Sound Blaster was a small improvement. The mids and highs were clear but not overbearing, and the bass was handled nicely. I listened to some jazz, house, techno, rock, and classical vinyl rips through this tiny speaker, and it picked up the nuances from each genre as well as can be expected from such a tiny device.Another plus is its size. It's smaller than I originally thought, but it does pack a punch. This obviously lends itself to easy portability and doesn't take up tons of space.Set up on my Mac was a breeze, and didn't take more than a minute. Windows users will probably face more set up time due to the need to download drivers, but Windows users should be used to the extra pains of, well, being a Windows user.As I stated before, though, as functional as this speaker is, it's just that, and nothing more: functional. The mids and highs and bass response are acceptable, but only just. For 100 dollars, it seems like this should be more loaded and powerful than it is, and as a Macbook user, where the built ins are nearly as good as what this speaker offers, you should get more bang for your buck.I would recommend this for those who just need a functional speaker with a lower-end Windows lap top. Anyone who has a higher end lap top with all the bells and whistles, and any Macbook user who has purchased their computer within the past few years would be smart to pass on this item.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Lot of potential, but definitely a 1st generation product", "body": "I was very excited to get to try out this new Nike+ GPS watch with Tom Tom.  I had used the Nike+ sensors for my shoes before, and while they were nice, my biggest complaint was that they weren't very accurate and if you walked/ran a lot they tended to run out of battery power within just a few months.  So when this GPS based Nike+ product came on the market I thought that this was really going to be the answer for increased accuracy and ease of use -- and while the accuracy is better, it has many shortcomings that make it a 1st generation product that could use some work.In the box (and I will say its packaged quite nicely!) you'll find the watch, a Nike+ shoe sensor, instructors and a USB cable.  Before you use it for the first time it is recommended (though not required) that you set the watch up to link with your Nike+ account (or create one) and download any firmware updates for the watch.  I decided to go ahead and go through the process to get everything ready before my first walk (I am not a runner, but I do go on many, many long walks at least 4-5 days each week).  The initial setup was pretty easy, and Windows 7 detected the watch and setup the necessary drivers without any problem.  I let it charge the watch overnight and then I was off!When I put the watch on I came across the first problem -- this watch was definitely designed for women or guys with more \"feminine\" wrists.  It is very tight on us bigger guys, and the bulkiness of the watch itself really puts pressure on your wrists when you are out of holes for adjustment.  The watch just barely fits me when I use the last set of holes.  Another concern is the USB connector - it's sort of \"hidden\" in the end clasp of the watch.  While this is a novel idea, and keeps it out of the way, I can see that over time it is going to get broken (it's just a thin plastic piece) and the connectors are going to get corroded from body sweat.  This really seems to be a major design flaw in my mind - not protecting the USB connectors from body sweat.Once I went outside you are supposed to let the watch synchronize with the satellites and the optional Nike+ sensor.  Keep in mind you are not required to use the Nike+ sensor, you can actually use the the GPS option, Nike+ sensor or both.  I decided to skip the Nike+ sensor as I do not have any shoes that are designed for Nike+ anymore (with the special compartment) and my preferred brand of walking/running shoes are New Balance and Under Armour nowadays.The synchronization with the satellites took a little bit of time - about 2 minutes.  Finally it was ready and off I went.  I went for a 3.2 mile walk and the watch seemed to be pretty accurate.  I enjoyed the calories burned feature, though I think it was a little off.  However, I consider that a \"neat\" feature but not a critical one.The watch itself worked great during the walk - though a few times I had to sort of move it around a bit because of the tightness of the strap.When I got home I plugged it back in to the computer to upload my walk to Nike+ and see the statistics.  This is where the real fun began.  It uploaded the new walk automatically, but then it informed me that a software update was available.  I downloaded that and then it said a firmware update was available.  I went ahead and told it to update but somewhere during the process the watch stopped responding.  Luckily it was able to correct itself by performing another firmware push and got things back into a usable state.  However, for someone who is not into computers this process could have been a little overwhelming.  A various periods of time Windows 7 kept telling me that new device drivers were being installed and a few other popups from the Nike+ software kept appearing and going away.Once I got through all that I was finally able to view the data and I was very pleased.  With the GPS functionality you can literally see your walks on Google maps and get detailed information such as your highest elevation, lowest elevation, slowest mile, fastest mile, etc.  It was nice being able to see my route through town and it was pretty spot-on accurate.  You also get the option to share your runs/walks with your Facebook and Twitter friends to get that social connection going -- and hopefully some motivation from friends and family!Overall, the watch is definitely something I enjoy having with me -- but there are some issues that need to be addressed.  First, the wrist strap and USB connector have to be reworked.  It simply is too tight for big guys (I'd say any guy over 6' tall or who is big boned) and long-term I am sure that sweat getting into the USB connectors is going to cause issues.  There is also the user-friendliness of the Nike+ software.  Firmware updates especially can be scary for non-technical folk.  This has to be reworked to make it more of a \"plug and play\" affair without the user having to take action.Overall, it's a good 1st generation product that no doubt will improve when the 2nd generation comes around.  For now this is strictly a gadget device that I'd recommend for the runner/walker who has everything else - so you might as well get them the newest toy on the block.  I'll continue to use mine, but I really am interested to see how they improve the product over time.", "rating": "mixed"}

The box is metal, with a red led that lights up when on, and a single volume control.2) Built-in power supply. Just plug into an outlet.3) Quick, push-in speaker connections. To me these are the easiest, and work just fine.4) Inputs are RCA plugs. Line level. Plugs straight onto most types of USB DAC.5) Runs cold to the touch at all times in normal use.6) Sounds ok most of the time if you are not over critical.The bad:1) Sound quality is muddy in the mid-range when dealing with any fairly complex music, such as distorted guitars. (Most of the time it sounds just great!)Overall, I'd recommend this amp if you just need something for a party or gaming, but it's just not quite up to the task for any sustained listening for me. I stopped using mine, and fetched my Kenwood 105VR out of storage, and can really hear the much lower distortion.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Not so portable, but nice anyways", "body": "I gave this \"portable\" iPod alarm clock to my son (17 years). He is an iPod kinda guy, so this seemed like it should work well to replace his ancient (much older than him) alarm clock with radio. So it turns out this becomes a mixed bag.Pros:* Doesn't sound bad - better than the alarm clock from the dawn of time.* He can read the digits from across his modestly sized room.* The iPod (he has an old disk based iPod Video similar to the current \"classic\")* The batteries, which were intended for portability, provide a nice backup to the clock function during power outages.Cons:* Only one alarm setting. He was hoping for two as the predecessor alarm clock had. This is because he has two different daily schedules and it's a drag to reset for them every week, twice a week. And, that is not a laziness deal so much as it is \"another chance to make a mistake\" issue.* It is NOT really all that portable. It does fold a bit, but overall, it is too heavy, the shiny case would become totally scratched in field use by teens, there is no way a frequent traveller like myself would carry a couple extra pounds of clock on a trip. Plus, it's bigger than you'd think.* No radio. What's with that? Charge the extra $1.98 and give us some FM here.Overall, we use it, but we think iHome has done better with their iH9 and other full  on clock radios.", "rating": "mixed"}

You can turn off touchpad clicking entirely via the software, but I would much rather have a sensitivity adjustment.

{"title": "Looks and feels like a dollar store item, but it works.", "body": "I have seen a unit that is exactly the same as this except it was solid black at a popular chain store. Don't know if the build quality is of better quality than this one. I hope so, because the one in the store cost about $15.00. You can look to spend up torwards about $100.00 for some other units that do the same thing.For the price I can't complain, because this unit works. For how long I don't know. The cables that come supplied are pretty thin, and the switch positions are very close and it is not a solid click between each position. You have to slowly switch over and feel for the click. I only have a wii and dvd player hooked up to it. So I just plugged one unit into number one and the other to number three. This way I can slide the switch all the way from one or three and I know it is in position without messing with it.Picture quality was good from dvd player and wii and sound from wii sounded fine coming from my LED t.v. The sound from my dvd player is hooked directly to my sound system so I can't comment on that. Unless your running your sound system through this and really cranking it up it should work fine. The expensive units try and justify their price by claiming better signals and such. RCA cables are old school basic wire connections. You can'r really improve on them so your cheapo cables will work as good as your expensive ones. Sure the thickness of them and the insulation helps, but you will probably never notice the difference. The only people that might notice a little difference are ones with high end equipment that are pumping a lot of power through their cables. This unit only cost a few dollars and it works so can't complain. If it lasts for a while and breaks, it is still cheaper to buy another one than paying for an expensive over priced unit.", "rating": "mixed"}

In my house, where my music system, my Sansa MP3 Player FM Tuner and car radios pick up 22 stations, this picked up 3 or 4 and almost none was good enough. There was cross-talk and garbled reception on weaker stations with the antenna fully pulled out as per the instructions in the manual.I connected the output of my Sandisk Fuze MP3 player FM Tuner to this unit using the supplied 3.5mm AUX Cable and all 22 stations worked perfect. This unit's FM receiver is simply junk.Even though I liked this unit otherwise, I returned this product to Amazon in 1 day. Now waiting for my refund.You can buy this product, if you don't care about FM. If FM is important to you, don't try it.Other weird issue with the FM tuner is that it doesn't store the FM Channels.

{"title": "Not bad for a budget tablet, but there are better now", "body": "When I bought the Elocity A7, there weren't a lot of Android tablets out there and most were much more expensive.  Given that, the Elocity was a deal.  It has a good chipset, decent build quality, and worked fine out of the box.  I thought I would love it more than my Nook Color eReader, but I don't.  In fact, I've barely used it since I bought it.The tablet is speedy enough, but it's plagued with a number of irritating issues.  The screen resolution is good enough for basic web browsing and game playing, but too poor to serve as an eBook reader... one of my main \"wants\".  The screen is not a multi-touch type display like the one on my smartphone, and only \"fakes\" multi-touch for the pinch and zoom feature.  The screen is otherwise decently responsive, except near the edges.After rooting the tablet, I had access to the Android Market, which was good.  I was even able to find a Honeycomb build for it and tried that out.  While I like Honeycomb itself and this tablet runs it well, the display hobbles the user interface enough that I have decided to dump the tablet.  I'm going to restore it to factory condition, box it up, and sell it here on Amazon as a used item.Battery life is also disappointing.  I can pull it off the charger in the morning, use it for a couple of hours during the day, then leave it out overnight.  When I turn it on the morning, the battery is low or even dead.  (This was true before and after rooting and Honeycombing it.)  I wouldn't want to rely on it for a long plane or automobile trip without some alternate charging method.If you want a somewhat inexpensive, snappy tablet, this isn't bad. If you want something to play media and games (assuming multi-touch isn't a concern for those games), it's probably decent enough.  But if you can spend a few more bucks, there are better tablets out there.  The Asus Eee Pad Transformer, for example, is a bit more expensive than the Elocity but infinitely better.  Its screen resolution is higher, its touch screen really is multi-touch, and it's just better all-around.  (Apple offers refurbished iPads that aren't much more, too.)", "rating": "mixed"}

Their Quality Control person(s) need to be re-educated as to what quality means. When I called after the first month of having this cord and it had freyed so badly, Apple told me they would not replace it under warranty, and that I needed to go buy a new one myself.

{"title": "David Week's MyMAc.com Review", "body": "When I was offered the opportunity to review the new Kensington SlimBlade trackball, I jumped at the chance. Eons ago, back in the mid to late 80's, I owned and loved one of the earliest Kensington ADB trackballs. It finally was put out to pasture when Apple discontinued the Apple Desktop Bus, but I got my money's worth from a great accessory.The SlimBlade is not your grandfather's trackball. This is a splendidly constructed mechanism, with a cherry-red trackball that rolls and spins effortlessly. The case is made of a subtly speckled grey plastic, but the material is substantial, and there's no cheap feel to it. The unit sits firmly on the desk, on four grippy pads, and the cable is over 36\" long, so it can reach almost anywhere. A nice touch is that the cable is wrapped in fabric, not plastic, so it has a good feel to it. At $129 the SlimBlade is pricey. Kensington has put together a great trackball, but how well does it work?Unfortunately, the answer is \"it works well, but it can be confusing to use.\"The trackball ships with a very short paper insert that tells you the barest essentials of how to use the SlimBlade, and to go to [...] to download the SlimBlade's driver installer software. Make SURE you read the insert! If you don't install the software, the SlimBlade's two lower buttons will still work; the lower left button provides the \"mouse click,\" and the lower right button pops up the normal Macintosh contextual menu. But who spends $129 for just a trackball with no extra features?Why do you have to go the SlimBlade website to get the software? Why doesn't Kensington ship and installer disk like everyone else? I posed this question to Kensington. They responded that they felt this is the simplest, easiest, and cheapest way to make sure the user always installs the most current version of the software. You don't need to worry about getting an obsolete software version if the particular SlimBlade you purchase has been sitting on the shelf for a while.I installed the software with nary a problem, except that after the installation I could not find any application software, no driver, no preference pane, or anything to tell me how to configure the SlimBlade. All you see after the installation is complete is a small SlimBlade icon in the Mac menu bar, and it's easy to overlook. There is no separate configuration application to fool with, it's all taken care of by the SlimBlade installer.Unfortunately, I learned the SlimBlade software is not compatible with my 1st generation (2006) Mac Pro. To evaluate the SlimBlade, I had to install the software on my MacBook Pro. I discussed this at length with Kensington Technical support, but as of this writing, no fix had been published.One click on the View Online Tutorial part of the SlimBlade icon in the menu bar took me to [...] where I learned how to use the SlimBlade's two large and two small buttons. There is a lot more to using the SlimBlade trackball than is presented in the paper insert. Plan to spend time viewing the tutorial; if you don't, you'll probably have troubles.Finally, I was making progress.The SlimBlade has three main modes: Navigation, Media, and View.You change between Navigation and Media modes by clicking the upper-left button. When you change modes, two things happen; the mode's icon appears on screen for a few seconds, then fades out, and the menu bar icon changes to show what mode you're in.Navigation mode is the default mode for navigating and simply moving the cursor. Rolling the trackball moves the cursor around the screen, as expected with any trackball. Normal mouse clicks are done with the lower left button. A click on the lower right button pops up the contextual menu. Clicking and dragging works normally. Kensington's new wrinkle is that rotating the ball scrolls the window up and down, as though you were clicking in the vertical scroll bar. Rotating counterclockwise scrolls up, and clockwise scrolls down. This can be done even without installing the SlimBlade software.Media mode allows you to choose iTunes tracks, control volume and Pause/Play audio tracks. The best thing about Media mode is that iTunes doesn't have to be the front most application, or \"have focus\" in geekspeak, to be controlled by the SlimBlade. While composing this review in Apple Mail, iTunes was playing in the background (\"Memphis in the Meantime\" by John Hiatt). Without leaving Mail, I could click the upper right button to switch from View to Media mode. Once in Media mode, rotating the trackball adjusts the volume. Successive clicks on the lower-left button cycled though Pause/Play, and clicking the lower right button stops playback.Media mode also provides the ability to choose tracks in iTunes by rolling the ball side to side. This was confusing, as the ball has to be spun sideways rather quickly to change tracks. If you don't spin the ball fast enough, nothing happens, so you double-check to see that you are truly in Media mode, then spin the ball faster to change tracks, and hope that it works.View mode is entered by clicking the upper right button. View Mode allows zooming and panning in certain programs. Just click the upper-right button to cycle between Navigation and View modes in supported programs. In Adobe Photoshop Elements, rotating the trackball zooms in and out. Normal rolling motions pan the image up/down/right/left.Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that Elements was supported. After failing to get View mode to work in iPhoto 8, I found it was not supported. I had to spend considerable time trolling the FAQ section of slimbladetrackball.com to discover which programs were supported, as there's no list on the box or in the paper insert.View Mode on the Macintosh OS supports the following applications:Adobe Acrobat 9Adobe Lightroom 2Adobe Photoshop CS3Adobe Photoshop Elements 6Apple Numbers 08Apple Pages 08Apple Preview 4Apple Safari 3Microsoft Excel 2004 and 2008Microsoft Word 2004 and 2008Microsoft Internet Explorer 7Mozilla Firefox 3View mode worked nicely in Safari; rotating the ball clockwise zoomed in, and counterclockwise zoomed out. If you have a Safari window sized such that you have to scroll laterally to see all the content, rolling the ball sideways will pan from side to side.If your favorite application is not listed, you won't be able to enjoy View mode.iTunes is the only Mac application that officially supports Media Mode, although I was able to adjust the volume in QuickTime Player. However, it would not respond to Play/Pause clicks.The lower-right button will pop up the standard Mac contextual menu in both supported and unsupported applications.I spent quite a while trying to get used to the SlimBlade software. Even after practice, I found it hard to recall exactly what mode I was in, and would then get unexpected results from clicks. You spend most of your time in Navigation mode, but if you click into Media mode to adjust the iTunes volume you need to remember to click back to Navigation mode. If you don't, the normal trackball rolling action won't work, and you'll be adjusting the volume when you expect to scroll up and down.You need to remember when in Navigation mode, the lower left button does nothing, but when in Media mode, it controls the volume. In Media mode, you have to click the upper left button twice to get to Navigation mode, as one click takes you to Media mode.If this seems confusing, it is. Get into the habit of clicking right back to Navigation or View mode as soon as you're done with Media mode. If you don't you're likely to get a bad case of mode confusion. However, the tutorials on the SlimBlade.com web site helped the learning process. If you are considering buying a SlimBlade, you owe it to yourself to check these out in advance of a purchase.For me, even after practice, I never got comfortable enough to quickly switch between the various SlimBlade modes without regularly finding myself in the wrong mode.Conclusion. The SlimBlade trackball is a fine piece of hardware, that suffers from difficult to use software, and poor documentation. More, and better, documentation should be provided in the box. The SlimBlade is not recommended unless you plan to practice enough to attain proficiency in changing modes, or you simply want an expensive, high-quality, plain-vanilla trackball to be used without the SlimBlade software.MyMac.com rating 2.5 out of 5", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Good waterproof camera with limitations", "body": "My wife purchased the Nikon AW100 from Amazon as a gift to me before a recent trip.There is a lot to like about the camera.  It takes very nice photos and videos.  The size is small so carrying it is easy and convenient.  Image stabilization is excellent.  It works well and takes good photos and videos under a few feet of water.  You can take excellent photos during rain.There are also some limitations with this and many other waterproof cameras. The controls have little travel, are too numerous, and are too close together.  The zoom control is inconvenient.The menus of the Nikon AW 100 are hopelessly misleading, complex and slow to respond.Battery life is poor with 200 shots max.  Buy extra batteries!Finally, do not buy aftermarket batteries for this camera because they will likely not operate the flash unit.  The Nikon battery is expensive, but it does work.I'm giving the camera a three star rating despite its issues and limitations due to the excellent photos and videos as well as because some of the limitations are intrinsic to current generation waterproof cameras.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Another one with focus problems", "body": "I had a D5100 and exchanged it for the D7000, which was back focusing, making many images (especially those at close range) soft. If the D7000 focused precisely out of the box, as it's supposed to, I would have kept it, since I liked all of the other features it has. All of my photos from the D5100 were sharp using the same lenses, so the lenses weren't the problem. I tried AF fine tuning and it helped a little, but not enough, even after reaching the maximum adjustment factor. A camera at this price level should have better quality control. Sure there are manufacturing tolerances, but they should be able to get the most critical assemblies close enough so the camera at least focuses properly, rather than hoping that customers won't notice or requiring them to spend hours fine tuning the AF, sometimes to no avail. It seems like getting a good D7000 depends quite a bit on luck. I've yet to decide if I'll try another D7000 or if I'll just go back to a D5100.The D7000 also overexposes in bright/high contrast situations when using matrix metering, causing highlights to be clipped and detail to be lost. Some say that this is just the advanced metering system working as intended. Perhaps, but it requires the user to use negative exposure compensation whenever a shot like this is taken (or to program it into one of the \"U\" settings). You don't always have time to do this when a a good photo op comes around. IMHO, this is a significant flaw that should be corrected via a firmware update.BTW, some have stated that the D7000 has better IQ than the D5100. All reviews I've read state that they are exactly the same in IQ, or that the diff is so small that it's negligible. This is consistent with my experience. In certain situations, like sports and low-light fast motion shots, the D7000's better AF and metering might help produce better photos, but for everything else, they're pretty much the same.UPDATE: I decided to give the D7000 another chance and ordered a second one. Same backfocusing problem. This time, adjusting the AF fine tuning by a factor of -4 for all of my lenses results in sharp focus, but using AF fine tuning isn't an ideal solution, since it causes the camera to not focus properly at infinity or at minimum focusing distance. Depending on the degree of AF tuning required, this could then require the user to manually adjust the focus ring after the AF has \"reached its limit\" (the limit which has changed due to the use of AF fine tuning). Another unnecessary hassle you need to remember to take care of. The AF fine tuning feature is nice to have, but its purpose is to dial-in lenses that are a bit off due to manufacturing tolerance. I don't think it was intended to adjust a faulty body to work with lenses that are in spec, but that's the way it's often being used.For anyone who buys a D7000, I'd recommend doing a focus test as soon as you get it, to ensure that you're getting the IQ you paid for. The best way to do this is with a focus test chart, but a quick and dirty method is to tape a page of text on the wall (make sure it's totally flat against the wall). Then, mount your camera on a tripod perpindicular to the wall, with lens (set at the largest aperture) at the same height as the page. Take a shot or two using autofocus through the viewfinder. Use the remote or self timer, with mirror lockup. Then take some shots using live view. If the AF photos are not as sharp as the LV shots (or at least very close to them in sharpness), your AF is off (most likely back focusing).", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Awesome for everything except weight lifting.  Longevity in question too.", "body": "I've bought two set's of these headphones (one for myself and one for my wife) and I absolutely love them for an all day/everyday headphone (comfort, sound, battery life, etc).  Unfortunately, though, I'm not able to give them as high a rating as they probably deserve.  I initially bought these because I was tired of having a wired set of headphones while working out in the gym.  Specifically, I was REALLY tired of running on the treadmill and knocking the cord, causing the phone to fall off the machine and to the floor.  These really fit the bill for that purpose as well as general all day use as both a stereo headset for music and for my many daily conference calls.  In all, I would typically use these for about 5-8 hours per day since I've gotten them (about 11 mo ago) so they've seen a bunch of use.  The problem is that just last week they stopped functioning properly.  I now only get sound out of the right side of the headphone and the left side only when I mess with the wire extensively.  It seems as though, through the excessive use and surely some inadvertent tugging on the wires, the electrical connection on the left side ear bud's wire has become compromised.  Good news is my wife's headset is still working since she uses it so rarely...so, I believe I've got a backup :).  Only other gripe I've got about these headphones is that, practically, they are not a great choice for weight lifting...for two reasons. 1.) During lying exercises (bench press, crunches, etc.) the headphones have a tendency to fall off my neck which usually pulls one or both of the ear buds out of my ears and distracts me from my lift quite a bit.  I'm sure I could fashion something to keep the neck strap in place but haven't decided to put any effort into it at this point.  2.) for pulling and overhead exercises (pull downs, pull up, rows, etc) my shoulders will tend to push one of the buttons on the neck strap, causing me to skip songs, turn down volume, even initiate calls inadvertently.  It would be nice if there was a way to lock the keys to avoid inadvertent button pushes...I checked, but have been unable to find anyway to accomplish this.For me, these get 3 stars (which really pains me since I love them so much) due to the longevity questions and the fact that there could be some improvements to avoid inadvertent button pushes and maybe a way to keep the headphones around the neck when desired.Generally, these headphones should get AT LEAST 4 stars with the only question being the longevity.  Again though, I imagine the longevity issues are more due to my usage than the product itself.Despite my 3 stars, I'm strongly considering grabbing another set if that tells you anything :)", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Functional, cheap, flawed", "body": "I got two of these and the price is certainly nice compared to others.  They are quite heavy, particularly the base, which is good for a product like this.  3 of the 4 clamps that hold the monitors work just fine.  One, however, no matter how tight I make it, just won't hold the monitor solidly.  I put a rubber band on the post just under the clamp and then it works ok, although unsightly.  The directions to put them together aren't very helpful, although it's not rocket science.  My other issue with functionality is that they have the main pole attached to the base with 3 small screws...yet there is a giant screw that can hold the pole to the base, but they set that up to only be used if you drill a hole through your desk.  You can use this giant screw anyway, but there is not recession on the bottom of the base for the screw head to sit and you'll have to pad it so it doesn't scratch the desk.When I called to bring these two issues up to them, his response was \"you're going to feel silly for asking\" because the big bolt is meant only for drilling a hole in your desk.  I think they should feel silly for not making this extra reinforcement usable.  Also, when I wanted a non-defective clamp, he said the only way to get one was to send back the defective one and wait for them to send me a new one.

{"title": "Almost great", "body": "I was truly excited about this camera.  Everything about the X10 from ergonomics to specs sounded like someone had finally made a camera just for me.  Taking it out of the box I was immediately impressed with the heft and solid feel.  Then I turn it on and things went down hill from there.What the X10 is not:  a rangefinder.  The X10 is purely a point and shoot operation.  I hoped for more manual control.  The X10 is just not designed that way.  Manual focus mode on the X10 is insultingly useless.  Shooting in aperture priority mode should be easy but the LCD screen is useless in bright sun and that is the only way to access the aperture and shutter settings.ISO:  specs sound great.  \"ISO 100- 12800\"  But the highest sensitivities are only available when shooting small JPEGs.  No raw above ISO 3200.Mechanics:  the zoom / power control ring on the lens sounded like a good idea.  But reality is mine had a very sticky spot at the 50mm mark and the actual \"on\" position is ambiguous.  No weather sealing on a $600 point and shoot?  80% humidity limit!  I would have happily paid $700 if it was weather sealed.Lens:  optics are great.  But the front element is very exposed without the impossible to obtain hood / filter adapter.  While compact in the off position, with the lens extended the front will get hit on something eventually.Viewfinder:  optical viewfinder is an absolute necessity for me.  That was 90% of why I bought the X10.  But it is too quickly blocked by the extending lens and of too limited coverage.  Having only LED indicators on the outside next to the viewfinder makes the viewfinder itself really only useful as a sighting tool in daylight (which is good as the LCD is unreadable in sun).  Just having basic exposure and focus confirmation in the viewfinder would have made this 10X more useful.I returned the X10.  Perhaps a version or two in the future Fuji will have refined this design into what I need.  But this is not it.  For now i wil continue relying on my DSLRs for \"real\" camera functions and a trusty Canon A590 point-n-shoot for a pocket camera.

{"title": "Good Video capability, but photo is not impressive", "body": "The Panasonic DMC-ZS3 (also called TZ7) is the 5th digital camera I have owned. I have been using Panasonic TZ1 for last 2.5 years and I am quite happy with TZ1 for its optical image stabilization and 10X telecope capability. However, the TZ1 is 5MP with standard Video (SD) only. So, I think it's time to upgrade.Though DMC-ZS3 has 12X power, but I think the practical maximum range is 8X-10X zoom, as the shooting object need to have clear edge for the camera to focus, when in 12X, most of time, the camera will not be able to find an edge for focus. This is a common limitation for most cameras. If the 12X is one of key reason for you to pick this camera, then  think again.I was hopping that TZ7 can have better picture-to-picture lag time. But it's still around 2 sec delay time. Kind of slow for taking kid's pictures.The DMC-ZS3 (or TZ7) has an IA mode that automatically adjusts the speed, ISO...,etc for you. In outdoor, well-light conditions, this IA mode is good. However, when shooting indoor, the IA mode tends to pick up ISO above 400. And you will be very very disappointed with the photos taken with ISO >= 400 by this camera, as the photos show very significant noise. My recommendation: stay away from the IA mode for all indoor shootings. Also, the flash light is on the weak side. So, stay closer to your object if you plan to use flash for indoor shooting. Overall, comparing with my old TZ1, I don't see better photo quality taken by DMC-ZS3 (or TZ1), especially for the indoor pictures.DMC-SZ3 has good video capability, you can zoom while taking video (same as TZ1), it also records stereo audio. It supports both standard video (SD) and AVCHD-lite (or 1280x720 HD). Quite some softwares can handle AVCHD editing, like AVS video editor, Corel VideoStudio Pro X2, Cyberlink PowerDVD Director Ultra 8, Nero 9..., etc. Window media player 12 (free) can play AVCHD video clips on you PC also. The AVCHD video clips from the camera can be uploaded into YouTube directly. That makes the video sharing captured by this camera more easier.You should use the IA mode when taking video in any low-light condition, the camera automatically adjusts the ISO sensitive, shutter speed to accomodate the low-light environment. Due to low-light, the video will be somewhat grainy (quite common for consumer level cameras or camcorders), but acceptable (remember, this is a camera, not a camcorder). In outdoor, well light conditons, it produces satisfactory video clips.In video taking mode, the camera will recognize face and try to focus on the face. However, if taking scenery video without clear objects (or edges) for the camera to focus, the video clips do not seem to be sharp.Battery life is on the short side, so, don't forget to charge it before your trip (you won't over-charge the Li-Ion battery).Overall, I like the 1280x720 AVCHD video function and the wide/telo zoom capability, but the photo quality is not very impressive (especially the indoor photos). I will return my DMC-ZS3 and keep my TZ1.", "rating": "mixed"}

The pores where my underarm hairs were pulled from were actually filled with blood afterward; not enough to ooze out, but you could definitely see it. Kind of scary, but it didn't hurt as much as I expected, since I tried this straight out of the shower. Will update when I use this longerAs I wrote in the title, it doesn't pick up shorter hairs or really fine hairs.For people who're using this for facial hair, I recommend using Sally Hansen's facial bleach, it works fairly well for upper lips but could irritate your skin a bit.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Used to be better", "body": "These are good earbuds. They'll USUALLY last for months, assuming you take care of them. I've had one of these ifrogz pairs last for 5 months. Not bad for $15 earbuds. However, the last two pairs I've bought have died a little too quickly. My last pair only lasted 2 weeks, though the only thing that failed was that the remote button. It keeps pausing and unpausing and randomly bringing up Siri. I'm moving away from this brand after 2 years of nothing but iFrogz.Mic quality is good, sound quality is better. I record audiobooks for my little brother just fine with these, and after playing with it have succeeded in making a professional sounding recording with a $15 pair of headphones.Tip - Don't wrap your headphones around your device then stick them in your pocket. That causes a short near the headphone jack. If you unplug them and coil them up every time, they'll last much longer.Used to love these, but the quality has gone down the drain. Only reason i'm giving it 3 stars is because of how good this brand has been in the past. If I were rating just on the last two pairs, this would be a 1 or 2 star review.", "rating": "mixed"}

Tech support said they were familiar with the issue, and provided a link with instructions and a program to flash the firmware in the case.  The 60 second process fixed the issue.EDIT to ADD: After using this enclosure for some weeks, the above fix did not fix the issue.  At least once a day, the power light starts flashing, and any attempt to access the drive results in a windows error.  Turning the enclosure power off until the computer unregisters the USB device, and powering it back on, fixes the issue for a while.  I have tried it using both the computers USB3 ports, and the internal PCIe USB3 add on card with the same results.  Operation is solid with USB2.  I have lowered the rating to 3 stars, since its useless with the current firmware for unattended USB3 operation, however it is still useful as a portable enclosure if used right away when plugged in/powered on.I would not recommend this enclosure to anyone wanting to add USB3 drives to a computer that is left on (server, business desktop, etc).", "rating": "mixed"}

On some sticks you can use BootIt to flip the RMB to achieve this but, not on the Kingston that I bought.  I got it to use as storage for a disk image of my laptop so that I could quickly restore my system if necessary.  Unfortunately, you can only create the disk image on a permanent drive as recognized by Windows.  Windows queries the RMB to determine whether or not the drive is a permanent one.  The SanDisk is seen that way by Windows but is too small for the drive image.  The Kingston is not.  And I can't flip the RMB.  Contacted Kingston and they said &#34;Nope, can't do that.&#34;.  In this day of large capacity USB flash memory sticks, that seems like a major drawback (or an attempt to force you to buy an SSD from them).  An SSD would not fulfill the role and is overkill.

These cans are designed with bigger heads in mind, and due to the arch they dig into your ear lobes and never fully encase your ear, which must lead to their lack of power. Even when pressed to my head I found the bass to be quite empty and just extremely underwhelming.

I guess if, your computer doesn't have a bluetooth connection and you are hard up on USB ports, that would be one thing -- but really, I have never had this issue.  I think bluetooth support is becoming the norm at this point -- particularly due to the prevalence of tablets and smartphones that might also want to talk to the \"mothership computer\".  And frankly having a USB receiver as I have with one of my trackballs is really not an issue for me -- I only really have 1... maybe 2 things to hook up temporarily via USB.Flipside is that network bandwidth is becoming increasingly scarce on home networks with ever device now seemingly wanting to access the LAN.  Also, if you take this mouse to work or to a public WAN -- you now have to repair it and remember the various paring profiles for the different locations.I just don't see this as a case where HP has built a \"better mousetrap\" or that there were people begging for this type of connectivity with their pointing device... but then again, their marketing folks didn't ask me ;-)If you want/need a wifi-based mouse -- this works great.

It fits but just barely, takes a lot of stretching and pulling to squeeze it in, has me wondering if it may damage the side buttons over time. After just a couple weeks of occasional use I've noticed a scratch down the back of my device that aligns with the stiff Kennsington label sown into flap that you must slip past with every insertion/removal. After a week, I cut a piece of stiff cardboard just a bit bigger than the device to stretch out the sleeve, makes sliding it in/out a lot easier. For my specific use, the iPad, it would be better if the opening were on the end rather than through a flap in the middle, since the touch screen needs to be fully protected and it would be a disaster to slide it in with the screen facing that scratchy label. Cutting off the label would no doubt leave an even sharper edge in the seam - that tough label material is bound to outlast the neoprene sleeve itself and scratch most materials before long. So, the label position scores it a 3.

This has allowed me to get to know the ins-and-outs of this motherboard pretty well. In general, it's a pretty good motherboard with alot of features at a decent price point. These days it's really the only FM1 mini-ITX motherboard available so there is not other choice.Of the dozen or so I've had three go bad that I've had to replace. Usually the complaint is that it will no longer POST. I've been through one RMA with ASRock which wasn't too bad and took a couple of weeks to turn around. The rest I was able to replace through the retailer, either Amazon or the 'Egg. That means 1 out of 4 have been bad.The biggest complaint I have with this board is the behavior of the BIOS. When in the BIOS, the A6-3500/A75M-ITX combination draws close to 90W as measure with a Kill-a-Watt. That tells me the BIOS is running the APU at maximum. It only takes 10 minutes or so of sitting in the BIOS doing nothing to get the CPU temperature reported as over 70C and the CPU fan running full blast. And, yes ASRock, the heatsink is seated correctly and the BIOS is the latest version. I have consistently reproduced this issue on every single A75M-ITX. As a matter of fact, I have one sitting right next to me as I write this and in open air the BIOS is reporting 76.5C and the fan is running at 2954RPM. Once you have Windows installed, idle at the desktop does not have this issue. Unfortunately, I have to explain to each and every customer this will happen so they don't freak out. The Gigabyte GA-A75N-USB3 board I have does not exhibit this behavior but I only have one and it's not available any longer.One small complaint is a strange one but it's the I/O shield. Facing the back of the PC, there is a lot of blank space on the left of the I/O shield. If you accidentally press against this area, there is no support behind it so it will pop into the case. You then have to get inside the case to pop it back out.Since this is the only FM1 mini-ITX available and the FM2 mini-ITX motherboard is an absolute nightmare, it'll have to do. Most of the time it works and most of the time it's not running at now 79C and consuming 90W. ASRock really needs to get their act together with their quality control and their BIOS behavior.", "rating": "mixed"}

The sound is thinner and the stereo field is unbalanced at lower volumes. The stereo field problem is really bad at low volumes. Maybe that is why a balance control is included instead of using quality volume components. Here's a point that I'd like to note that did not influence this review. It was a mistake to buy the 40Watt instead of the 15W version. I find that this 40W version is too powerful for my intended use. I often have to set the volume knob at low settings where the stereo and sound character issue is present.

I've become &#34;spoiled&#34; with the great pictures of the DSLR so I am no longer satisfied with the quality of pictures from my phone or a point and shoot so I was really hoping this 85 mm lens would allow me to take great quality pictures, including great close-ups of the action, while also being a bit more portable for impromptu outings. The lens IS a much more &#34;mom friendly size&#34; but, after trying it out several times on various outings and playdates, I ultimately decided that the focal length was just a bit too long for the &#34;average&#34; visit to the park (and way too long for standard indoor playdate venues) and I more often than not found myself missing shots because by the time I backed up enough to fit everything in the frame, the moment had passed. If I had the money to spare, I would have kept this lens because it takes beautiful pictures and I am sure it does have a place in the more serious photographer's bag but for a mom on the budget, I just didn't think it would get used enough to justify keeping it.", "rating": "mixed"}

It delivers and my photos are great quality, indoor and outdoor. For those who like more control, the camera also has manual controls. One tiny drawback is that the controls aren't as &#34;intuitive&#34; as my other digital cameras. You'll probably need the manual handy the first time you use it. No big deal. My problem is getting my fine pictures OUT of the camera. It is wireless only. Great! One less cable to keep up with. Not so fast. The setup for wireless is a colossal pain in the neck. You have to register on the Canon image gallery website. Then register the camera. Then set up the access point. Then register the computer, smartphone, tablet, etc you'd like to to send the pictures to. Fine, that is expected. After all of that, you upload the pictures and realize you can't even crop a photo on the CIG website/app, much less do any real editing. You have to do it using the 3&#34; screen on the camera first. Whatever, I'll import into iPhoto on my Mac. If only the camera would stay connected to the computer! After 20 aggravating minutes, I gave up and loaded the SD card into the adapter attached to my computer and uploaded that way. You can &#34;upload&#34; an album to twitter and facebook (sorry, no other video/photo sharing apps) from the CIG, but to share them with your friends requires password?

Touch screen doesn't always work the way you expect. Sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough.2. Using the touch screen for simply entering channel numbers is frustrating. Entering 210 is sometimes 21, sometimes 10... way too often.3. Need physical buttons for paging ahead and channel numbers.4. No feedback on the touch screen. A vibration or number pop-up (like the iPhone) would be very beneficial.5. Needs customization options.Overall, not worth the money.Update:  I sent it back 2 days ago. I could no longer stand the touch screen. Not having haptic feedback is a BIG deal killer. Its just not what I expected and my family started complaining about it. It took 3 calls to different numbers to finally get an RMA#. Logitech did not charge for return postage via UPS. So that was nice.  I ended up getting a refurb 900 for $ 135 + tax. Its a $ 399 unit.

{"title": "Error message issue at the PC start-up", "body": "This device is fast and has worked fine without any issues until yesterday after a month of use. I normally leave this 16GB USB drive plugged in to my desktop PC whether the PC is on or off. Yesterday I installed an external Western Digital 1.5T harddrive and immediately after I turned on my PC, an error message \"disk I/O error, replace drive and hit any key to continue\" appeared. I thought my new hard drive was bad. Without doing anything I hit the Ener key and my PC started up without problem and all the drives worked fine without issue. To further test the cause of the issue, I unplugged all the external drives (three including this 16GB USB drive) one at a time and found out when this USB drive is not plugged in, the error message also disappeared at the start-up. Interestingly, if I plugged this USB drive when the PC is already on, then no error message would appear. I also moved this USB drive to a different USB port, the same error message would appear at the PC start-up. I also tested using another USB drive and encountered no error message at all. It is convincing the error message is triggered by this 16GB USB drive. In reality no real problems are caused. I can access data in this drive as long as I ignore the error message by hitting any key to continue the start-up. Has anyone seen this problem?", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "I'm forever blowing bubbles", "body": "If you have a shared iPad--especially with kids around--you might be interested in this little protector.  Even though my iPad is strictly monogamous, I still notice the buildup of fingerprints. The fingerprint-fading technology of this protector was enough to make me curious.  I don't doubt that it works wonders for some people, but it didn't for me.  There's very little loss of visible resolution with this overlay (but there is a little, with a tiny bit of yellowish color-cast), but the issue I couldn't get past was trapped bubbles. Even after reading the instructions and watching a few online videos, I wasn't able to get a completely smooth attachment. The issue is the generously-named 'applicator' provided with the kit.  It's a piece of cardboard attached to the package--in this case with a little blob of glue right along the business edge. You're supposed to push out the bubbles as you gradually lay the sheet down on the iPad.  Problem is that many of them stay behind because of the cheap applicator.  Getting rid of the bubbles then is virtually impossible (if you're old enough, you'll remember waterbeds from the 70s).  I hoped they might work themselves out, but after a day my iPad still looked like a water-specked windshield.  Off came the protector and back into myMarwarecase went the iPad.I don't wish to discourage potential customers who have a need for screen protection, but I do want to point out how tricky application is.

{"title": "Review For The Square Perfect SP500 Platinum Photo Studio In A Box with 2 Light Tents", "body": "I have used the SP500 studio for a while now, and even though it does the job, I think it is not worth much over $90 - $100 due to the overall quality, as I paid a lot more than the current $135 price point on Amazon for this kit I have \"Star Rated\" it based on the actual price I paid.The overall lighting from the 2 stands with bulbs is slightly under powered, and I tend to use additional lighting to augment what comes with the kits.The camera tripod that came with the kit is rather clunky and I would suggest buying a better one when your budget allows for it, but as a starter kit the tripod will work as intended.As many other reviewers have pointed out, the backdrops do crease really easy, and when first unpacked are almost unusable due to excessive creasing. The way I remedy this was to iron them with a stream iron, then use \"Pants Hangers\" and hang them in my closet, once I started to do this the creasing issue went away.The carrier that is provide is Ok it does the job, but at least this kit came with one so at least that was an added bonus.Where I ran into trouble was while I was photographing small objects, as I needed even side lighting and not top lighting the 2 stand lights, just did not work. Now the issue that forced me to knock a start of this products rating.Most people tables are 28 to 30 inches high, the as the maximum height the bulb can raise is 32 inches to the center of the bulb, if you have a product that is 8 to 10 inches tall, you will need to start placing these stands on books to get to your desired height.Overall, as a start kit priced around the $135 mark it does allow you to get started taking pictures. If you are looking for a good starter kit under $100 and are not worried about a carrier you may want to look at theShutter Starz Tabletop Complete Photo Studio Kit w/2 Light Tents & 8 Backgrounds, unfortunately at the time I purchased the SP500 Platinum Photo Studio kit the one I suggested was not available.I hope you will find this review helpful from someone that has owned this kit now more than 3 months.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Overrated and overpriced", "body": "I bought these a few years ago to give them time to break-in and develop their sound stage, etc. What I discovered has left me disappointed.When I opened the packaging, the first thing I noticed was that there were no gold connections. For $250, the connections should be gold, and the wires of a higher quality, but instead they give you the cheapest things they had. When I set it up, I noticed that the speakers would go in and out, and would always have a hiss. I bought a better cable that connects the computer to the speakers, and some of the hiss went away, but the speakers would go in and out. I found the reason for this was due to the connection of the volume thing to the back of the sub. It's a flimsy connection, and if it isn't in right, the speakers don't work. If I get it in right, I can't move the sub without having the speakers go out. Very frustrating.Now when they are working correctly, they sound pretty good. However not worth $250. If you listen to music for an extended period of time (over 1-2 hours) the sub gets very hot even when well ventilated. And while you can crank up the volume on these and they feel like 1000 Watts worth, that quickly ends, and in about 30 minutes they aren't much louder than my headphones. Furthermore, if you're playing mp3's a lot, the encoding of the songs better be pretty high, or you'll hear a lot of digital artifact. I save my music as lossless, so I don't have a problem there, but many listeners may.The Bass is good, but soon dims out by the end of a CD. And if you turn up the volume, they seem to limit how loud they can get, and eventually drown out under the highs. The speakers are also good at normal volume, but unacceptable for a party as they sound metallic and mechanical, not warm like some bose systems. My speakers are set up to an amp from my computer that helps drive them, but I have found that for $100 less you can get logitech or creative and have just as good of sound. Bose makes some good products, but they start at a higher price; these don't quite satisfy the ears.I would not recommend these for any listener, because using these in the office leaves you listening to hiss and better computer systems are available at a cheaper price.Edit May 2013:So in my shame I gave them to my mom so she could use them for her work computer. And she prefers the old speakers! As she described it, these sound 'tinney' and 'hollow.' Now women have better hearing then men, especially at the higher frequencies (babies crying and screaming high) so I wasn't surprised that she could hear some of the 'tinniness' that I couldn't. They're truly overpriced and over-branded. The only thing I liked about them was the remote, which I still like actually.If you're looking for an alternative recommendation, I replaced these with Klipsch THX 2.1 speakers, and the difference was night and day. The price was the same, and now my mom wants them too. I will be avoiding Bose from now on!", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "does pretty much what one can expect (nothing more)", "body": "My wife has one of the original Sony noise-cancelling earbuds, which were bulkier and more expensive but work quite well. I ended up borrowing them all the time for plane trips, so as we were traveling together, I got a pair of the updated version.A few general remarks about active noise cancellation. It works quite well on monotonous low-frequency noises (read: airplane engines), but will be pretty useless against \"the sound of eight crying babies\" (for you Simpsons fans out there). The Sonys are in-ear, so if you can achieve a good seal in your ear canal you get passive damping in those frequency ranges.Also, pretty much every active noise-canceller I tried introduces a bit of white noise in the treble range --- generally only noticeable if you don't play music through them.Furthermore, don't expect active noise-cancellers to give great sound unless you're willing to pony up big bucks. I tried the $350 Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones (which cost five times as much) and while they sound as good as any ANCHs I've ever tried, they can't hold a candle for sound quality to my trusty $40Sennheiser PX 100 Collapsible Headphones.Engineers have a saying: \"better, cheaper, faster --- pick any two\". For headphones one could paraphrase it to: \"good noise cancellation, hi-fi sound quality, affordable --- pick any two\". Allegedly, the newSennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise Canceling Headphonesgive you both superior cancellation and hi-fi sound, but they cost an arm and a leg.If one keeps these remarks in mind, the Sony MDR-NC22 do pretty much what you can expect. The combination of active cancellation and passive isolation works better than either on its own --- but mine do have a pronounced hiss. Sound quality is decent but not great --- anything that has a strong, busy bass line (so forget Iron Maiden, Rush, or Dream Theater) is clearly too much for them, trebly electronic stuff sounds fairly OK. Again, expect to pay much more money if you want both active cancellation and good sound.Unlike the bulkier original with its fixed rubber flanges, they have removable in-ear flanges (in 3 sizes), and those got stuck in my ears a couple of times. Nothing scary or dangerous, just annoying --- but this could of course happen with pretty much any in-ear earphones.Bottom line: I'm keeping them for trips but am not going to use them as general-purpose headphone replacements.

I've not used any other in car type nav systems so I have no basis for comparison. So be aware that some of what I say may not necessarily be true only for the Go 910, they could be typical of nav systems in general.Mounting bracket-I had the same problem as mentioned by other reviewers with the unit sagging on the bracket.  I discovered that if you continue turning the locking mechanism past the first click it tightens the bracket more and you will no longer get any sagging of the unit.  Since I discovered this little trick, I have had further problems with the mounting bracket.Maps-first of all if you haven't obtained the new updated maps you need to do that.  They are an improvement over the old.  That said, they still leave a lot to be desired.  The old maps didn't recognize my home address or show many of the streets in my community.  Unfortunately, the new maps are no better in that respect. They still don't recognize my address or many of the streets in my community and my house was built 5 1/2 years ago!  But there are signifigant improvements in many other highways and routes.  What I find curious is why any of the internet mapping sites, e.g. Mapquest, Google, AAA, etc. all recognize my home location yet the maps advertised as the best maps yet by TomTom still don't recognize my home address.Routing -  Most the time the routing algorithm does a decent job.  Even if you go off the route it is very quick to re-route you.  I have to question the accuracy of the algorithm for long trips however.  I have one trip I make which is about 600 miles and there are numerous alternatives for it.  When I make this trip and navigate using the fastest route it doesn't use what I, Mapquest or AAA consider the fastest route.  I have driven all the main routes for this trip and I know which is the fastest and the shortest.  If you request it calculate an alternate, it selects an alternate but still not the fastest route.  In order to get it to use the route I want I need to do that by using the \"travel via\" option.  You also need to be aware that if you use the shortest route option it will route you off of highways onto backroads that connect up again with the highway you were on, but it was \"shorter\" to use that road.  It may also route you onto dirt roads, been there-done that!Battery-Some of you have mentioned that the battery can overcharge.  This is true, TomTom does NOT recommend that you leave the unit plugged in to the charger at all times.  This will overcharge the battery and the unit will not boot.  The fix for this is a \"soft\" reset.  Supposedly, a soft reset does not wipe out any of your specific data like, Favorites, etc.  However, it did on mine so be aware and try to avoid overcharging. Since you can't leave the unit plugged in at all times it may be be difficult to tell when the battery is getting low.  There is no audible warning only a small visual warning that you may not even notice it as you are traveling.  I've had the unit go dead a couple times because I didn't notice the warning.Customer Support-This is a mixed bag.  Sometimes you will get responses by submitting them online, sometimes you won't.  Calling in with your questions will get you answers but be prepared to wait a long time before you get to speak to someone.  Make sure you have something else to do while you are waiting.Bluetooth-This functionality is great as long as you have a phone that is compatible.  Fortunately mine is.  It was a large part of the reason I bought this unit.MP3 Player-Haven't used this. The unit does have a jack and cable for  output to your car's sound system but unless your sound system has an input jack (mine does not)its pretty much useless.  I doubt that you want to listen to MP3s from the base unit.  They would not be very good quality.All in all I've been pretty satisfied with this unit. It does a pretty good job of getting me where I need to go most of the time.", "rating": "mixed"}

Anyway, the BIG CAVEAT on this is that the 1080p (if it exists) is not available for any PC hookups, even thru an HDMI connection.  (I proved this to myself by playing a 1080p blu-ray DVD thru my PC, and hitting the Pansonic remote Info button, which relayed I was looking at a resolution of 1366x768.)  Now the picture still looked fine enough, so if you are buying as a PC monitor and getting this TV at a price comparable to 720p competitors, then that's a reasonable way to consider this choice.  But as a monitor, it should not command a premium 1080p price.Now, supposedly based on the manual, if you connect a non-PC source (like a blu-ray player, or perhaps a video game) thru HDMI then you will realize 1080p resolution.  That's the part that seems logicaly quirky to me, since I personally would want a screen size larger than 24in if I was bothering to hook up those type of accessories.  While I'm sure some people like a 24inch bedroom or kitchen TV and want to hook up a Blu-ray player to it (although then you have to deal with the subpar speakers of the TV), I think panasonic's logic to restrict PC hookups from the 1080p means it really limits its audience potential.LED - Again, Panasonic makes this confusing.  On various websites including its own, Panasonic highlights the LED nature of the 24 inch (vs the IPS LED in the 32 inch.)  Yet nowhere on the box or in the manual does it claim to have LED performance.  So who knows on this one.  Again, the imagery generated from my PC looks fine on this \"monitor\", its just a question of what value is this machine worth when one is comparing it to other options which really are indisputably LED.So I'm debating whether to keep or return. (The HDMI is a reason to keep.)  So it will depend on whether I feel I really need a 1080p PC monitor, and what alternatives are available at the price point I purchased this at.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Picture Quality Just Okay...", "body": "Ive had this camera for a few years, and I do have to say its a pretty decent camera for the price. The features/settings are easy to use (if you can use the internet, you can use this camera).The image quality really varies, though. Sometimes I get amazing pictures, sometimes I get poor pictures, and most of the time I just get mediocore pictures. The 12.0 megapixel has little to do with picture quality- but more to do with picture size. The screen on the computer usually puts the pictures at 4000x3000. Thats fine, but sometimes the pictures come out a tad blurry or watery. Then again- this is a digital camera, and not a 35 mm. So I didnt expect perfectionIt does have a video camera as well- which is decent and has clarity. But the audio quality will be poor. (think bad mp3). So its a trade off.All in all this camera is good if you want to take some snap shots and get some good ones in. The majority of the pictures will be just okay to use, maybe for facebook photos to show your family and friends. It does have \"scene\" options and flash as well.

It's not exaggerated, particularly as pertains to the installation of the front. The suggestion to install it in a semi-steamy bathroom to control the dust is a good one, and the suggestions that you push hard when removing the water and bubbles is appropriate as well.In my case I didn't probably press as hard as I could have (though I thought so at the time) and was left with a hazy screen with over 50 bubbles. They say the bubbles will all be gone in 72 hours. That wasn't the case for me, in fact I'm on my second week and still have two bubbles - but after seeing the others slowly go, I have faith these two stubborn ones will be gone as well. If I were to do it again I'd use more of the solution as well, basically using the entire bottle.I've read that the iPad glass is extremely scratch-resistant, and this is much different than covering say, an iPhone that may sit in your pocket in constant contact with keys and coins, etc. That said, the Bodyguardz shows less fingerprints so that's a plus.Make no mistake, this product is not invisible - you will know there's something on your screen. Viewing the product with the device off you'll see some distortion, but it's inconsequential when the device is on and operating.UPDATE: On my new iPad rather than buy this again I went to the mall to have GhostArmor installed. It was about $10 more but way better; they do the installation and do it well - there are few if any bubbles and they dissipate quickly. Also, it comes with a lifetime warranty.

{"title": "OK for price but no access to Google Play apps", "body": "Let me preface this review by saying I have an Ipad and was not expecting an Ipad when I bought this. I wanted an inexpensive Android tablet to play with so this seemed to fit the bill and was an Amazon Prime item, so I went ahead with the purchase. When I received the tablet I opened it right away and started playing with it and found the interface fairly easy to navigate (after I figured out what pressure was needed to use on the screen). It is a resistive screen rather than the Ipad's capacitive so one needs to press down harder on the screen than with the Ipad. I found that a stylus works better on this kind of screen.The 7 inch screen has its pros and cons - 7 inches is a little small to read on some websites and the gestures you need to use to zoom in are hard to master and don't work on some sites. It is small enough to drop in a bag and take with you. At $90.00 or so I am more comfortable taking that along everyday than the $500 Ipad.For me the deal breaker was that you cannot access the Google Play (formerly Android Market) store. There is a GetJar app pre-installed on the device that gives you access to some of the apps in the Google Play store but unfortunately the ones that I was interested in were not included in GetJar. If you are interested in certain apps check the GetJar website first to see if they are offered on GetJar before you order this tablet. I ended up returning the tablet a few hours after I opened it. Amazon refunded my credit card quickly but I would have liked it if I had a choice for shipping the tablet back without them deducting $9.08 from my refund for shipping. They only offered a pre-paid label option and since I ship for my home based business I could have found more economical shipping options than this.Since I was interested mostly in the specific Android apps I ended up buying an Android phone for $100.00 and will not be activating it, in essence creating a kind of Android &#34;Ipod Touch&#34;.Bottom line - if you want an entry level tablet that is not too expensive and you don't care that you can't access the Google Play marketplace this would be a good option.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Outdoor Speakers", "body": "I purchased a set of these Polk Audio Atrium 4 outdoor speakers to add music to the backyard so I could stream music during barbecues and parties. I hired an a/v company to install some ceiling speakers (Polk RC60i) in my bathroom - and since they were already at the house, I had them install these as well. Installation seemed to be a snap, though I would expect that from someone who installs speakers all day. :)So how do they sound? GREAT! In fact, I cant believe how good these speakers sound considering they are outdoor speakers. I have them connected to the receiver in my media room and stream my iPhone collection to the outdoors.So why only 3 stars? I have found that the sound from these speakers does not reach nearly as far as I had expected. Even with the receiver volume cranked, you can barely hear them on the deck (directly above where they are mounted). While this may be a function of where we chose to have them installed, be aware that installing these under a deck will not produce the desired results for on the deck. Additionally, if I'm in the garage 15 feet away, there's very little I can hear.Depending on what you're trying to accomplish in your outdoor space, you may need to purchase a couple sets of these speakers. If I decide to run speaker wire to the garage, these will be the speakers I purchase based on how great they sound.Note: This will be the first Minnesota winter these speakers get to experience.

A little over a year after I bought my Mac, the outer insulation on the attached cord separated from the power brick, exposing a few inches of the wire inside. I was able to put electrical tape around it. The adapter still functioned in this state for almost two years, but eventually the exposed wires shorted out and the adapter failed to charge the laptop reliably.My girlfriend, who purchased her MacBook Pro at about the same time, experienced a similar problem, except it was the insulation around the AC extension cable that came apart. I replaced my faulty power adapter with a cheaper, generic model (MAGSAFE 85W Power Adapter for Apple MacBook Pro) that is still working fine after four months.To increase the longevity of the power adapter, I recommend that you avoid winding the cord very tightly around the built-in winder clips.", "rating": "mixed"}

I&#34;m using it for my small business.  The computer tower is tucked under my desk, and the keyboard and mouse are on top, within 3 feet of the transmitter plugged into my computer, and with a line of sight to the tower.First, the keyboard: sometimes it's slow to respond, and slow to display what I've typed.  Sometimes, but not often, it will skip a letter that I'm certain I typed.  Granted, that could be user error, but I've never had that problem in times past.  There is a wrist rest built into this keyboard, which is nice.  But what I really don't like is that there is neither a CAPS lock nor NUM lock light to indicate when these features are on or off, and so if I'm looking at what I'm typing instead of the screen, this can cause aggravation when I have to retype something.Second, the mouse: It responds well, but it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow.  My first set of batteries lasted 2 months; 3 more sets have lasted a month each.  The first set are the batteries that came with the mouse; the rest have been Duracell batteries, and not some cheap brand.  Also, there is no light to indicate when the mouse batteries are low; it just begins to jerk around, and then quickly quits working altogether.  This has been a real disappointment.Because of these two factors, I'm considering replacing this wireless set.  If the keyboard display lights and mouse battery life are a factor to you, keep them in mind when selecting your wireless keyboard and mouse.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Good Sound - Mediocre Fit", "body": "My Etymotic Research ER-6i earphones finally died after a few years of heavy use at the gym and I decided to give these Brainwavz a try after reading some very positive reviews. In retrospect, I wish I had spent the extra money and stayed with Etymotic. While there are indeed some positive aspects of the M2s, the inability of these phones to stay put while exercising was the breaking point for me. Here are some pros and cons:Pros- Sound: These phones pump out a great sound. Bass is better than the Etymotic ER-6i phones. Like most headphones, make sure you burn them in.- Cord: I really like the thickness of the cord. Feels very durable and has the right amount of weight to it. Also, the length is just about perfect for me, although I could see it being too short for some people. Cord is a few inches shorter than the ER-6i's cord.- No/low maintenance required: Unlike the ER-6i phones, these phones don't require you to change out filters. Also, the ear-tips on these phones seemed to stay cleaner longer than the ones from Etymotic.Cons- Fit: This was really the killer for me. I have fairly narrow ear canals and the design of these earphones did not fit well in my ears. Now that's not to say that they were uncomfortable, but as soon as I started moving around and working up a sweat, the M2s couldn't seem to hang on. Brainwavs doesn't give you too many options in terms of foam pieces (whereas Etymotic does). Some people may find the design of the M2s to be perfect for them, and that's great.- Sound Isolation: Because I couldn't get a real solid fit, the sound isolation wasn't nearly as good as with the ER-6i phones. Even if they were to fit me, the foam tips don't really have the earplug effect that other noise isolation phones do. If good noise isolation is critical for you, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "To clear up any confusion (I hope)", "body": "I have never ordered nor received this seller's batteries, so please disregard the my star rating of \"3\" (had to put something down).I do, however, own quite a few members of the X6x(s) series, including 1 each of the X61, the X60 Tablet, the X61 Tablet, and several X61s machines.  I also owned, in the past, a couple of X60 machines.I can understand people's confusion, however it is in fact VERY simple, although Lenovo's numbering scheme for their machines and their battery part numbers are beyond confusing.  Note that there are a huge number of versions of each type of battery that may differ only in some minor changes in manufacturing such as a trivial increase in storage capacity of a given battery form factor.  You can look this stuff up on the Lenovo website if it interests you.Here is what is important in selecting a battery for your X6x(s) machine:(1) The batteries for the tablets have a completely different form factor and are NOT interchangeable with any of the non-tablet versions of the X6x(s) series;(2) There is one unique battery that ONLY fits the X60s and X61s, which is much smaller than all the other ones and fits flush at the back of the X60s/X61s machine.  It is entirely flat on the bottom, the only one of the (non-tablet) version batteries that is flat on the bottom.  I believe it has only 2 cells, but it might have 3.  It does not last very long (1.5 to 2 hours per charge) compared to the other batteries, and it cannot be used when the machine is placed on an \"Ultrabase\" docking station accessory.  I have an old one of these batteries and its parts numbers are 92P1164 and 42T5247.  I'm sure there are essentially identical batteries with different part numbers out there.  This type of battery will not fit the X60 or X61 because it is too wide to fit in the space near the electrical connectors.(3) All the other batteries for the non-tablet X60/X61 and X60s/X61s will fit BOTH machines, HOWEVER:(4) The X60s and X61s machines weigh less than the non-\"S\"versions, and one of the things done to accomplish this was to have a bigger space at the back of the machines that is AIR, and not plastic or metal case material.  Therefore, in order to fill this air-gap there is a plastic spacer that measures around 2\" across that screws into the 2 visible screw holes in the battery.  If you have an \"S\" type machine and you have any battery other than the tiny one I refer to above in #2, you can easily spot the spacer I am describing.  If you look at the pictures of this battery for sale in this listing, you can clearly see these screw holes are visible.  Lenovo, when they sell a battery that could go in either machine, includes this plastic spacer piece in the box with the battery, and you can either screw it on if you have an \"S\" machine or leave it off if you have the plain X60 or X61 machine.  Generic replacement batteries generally DO NOT come with this spacer;this means that:(5) if you have an X60s or X61s, and you want to buy a generic battery, you NEED TO KEEP the spacer from your old battery (unscrew it off the old one) before disposing of the old battery, so that you can transplant it onto the new one.(6) The above explains why someone with an X61s or X60s would have a \"loose\" fit or an air gap when installing a generic battery being sold for an X60 or X61, and why a battery WITH THE SPACER ALREADY installed (as for an \"S\" model) would not fit a non \"S\" machine without first removing the spacer by unscrewing it.(7) There are a lot of bad batteries out there for sale; I have no idea of the quality of the batteries this seller is selling.  The most important things to know are the quality of the electronics in the battery (basically unknowable for generics, unfortunately) AND the freshness of the battery.  Lithium batteries are by their very nature unstable, and any battery that was made more than about 6 months prior to your purchase should be avoided.  This includes OEM, Lenovo-produced, batteries.  Many sellers of \"genuine Lenovo batteries\" have \"new-old stock,\" and a lot of them, genuine or not, will not work for more than a very short period after which they will die.  This is doubly true when seeking batteries for an older laptop such as an X6x(s), unfortunately.", "rating": "mixed"}

At best my cellphone, iPad, and netbook get a bar more reception and perhaps a bit more throughput but again nothing ground breaking.  Since I broke the old antenna while installing this I will be keeping the Alfa antenna but if I were to do it again I would probably not buy it and invest my money in something else.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Decent product with difficult setup and some technical problems", "body": "I bought two of these, one to use as a wireless adapter and one as a repeater.  My primary wireless router is a Dlink DIR-622 running the original 1.11 firmware.Initial setup is fairly easy. The manual is TERRIBLE but you really don't need it for basic setup.  Out of the box, or after a hard reset, the device is in \"Gateway Mode\" with it's DHCP server active and ready to hand out addresses in the 192.168.1 subnet.  Connect it to a PC's ethernet port, open your browser to [...] and you get the configuration screen.  From there, it is easy to choose one of the other (3) modes and make a connection to your wireless network.If you want to make additional configuration changes to other parameters, it gets harder. Once you switch from Gateway mode to one of the other (3), the device no longer acts as a DHCP server for the ethernet port; rather, it effectively becomes a device with a static IP of 192.168.1.220.  To make additional configuration changes, you must open your PC's TCP/IP settings and change from DHCP (i.e., \"obtain an IP address automatically\") to a static address (i.e., \"use the following IP address\") in the 192.168.1 range.  Only then can you again open your browser and use [...] to access the device.I setup the first unit in \"Adapter mode\", configured it for wpa2 and then connected it to my Dish Network 622 dvr.  Everything connected and worked perfectly.I have a large house with my wireless router at the North end, so signal quality at the South end of the house is poor.  I configured the second wl-330ge for \"Repeater mode\" and placed it near the center of my house.  Devices in the South end now get excellent signal quality from the centrally located wl-330ge repeater.  Devices that used to get 6mbps now hit 35mbps.Both my units came with firmware 2.0.1.8, but I noticed a newer 2.0.1.9 firmware on the ASUS web site with 11-23-2009 release date.  As it mentioned a fix related to Repeater mode, I decided to download it and update both units.  I then hard reset and reconfigured them.  The one in Adapter mode still worked just fine.  The one in Repeater mode ceased to function; devices would connect to it momentarily then lose the connection.  After several hard resets and reconfiguration cycles, I gave up and flashed it back to 2.0.1.8, and it immediately started working again. If you are using Repeater mode, I recommend avoiding the 2.0.1.9 firmware.", "rating": "mixed"}

The Sony has a yellow cast to it, while the Samsung is a cooler bright-white, and with much more contrast.  It's just far more pleasing to the eye when looking at photos.  I haven't tried a video, yet.  Also, the Samsung has a noticeably bigger screen - though that's not really a deal breaker.  In certain ways, I actually prefer the size of the Sony.  I thought the browser speed was very good on the Sony, and I generally like everything else about it.  It's a nice weight, though it does feel a bit \"toy-like\" - but I'm OK with that.  I'd get a cover for it, anyway. I didn't try the remote control, but, really, I barely watch TV, so it doesn't much matter to me.  Maybe I just got a bad unit, screen-wise, but for me... it's a deal-breaker.

{"title": "Incredible Value, but HDMI Video Issues mar an otherwise perfect Entry-Level Receiver", "body": "Unlike a lot of CEs, Onkyo may have indavertantly cannibalized its own model lineup by pushing so much featureset into an entry level receiver that it might deter buyers from their higher end models. I recently did a thorough comparison of the Pioneer VSX-1020 and Denon AVR-791 and the Onkyo nudged out the Pioneer due to its beefier amp section and OSD capabilities. That said, I must caution users that its value is marred by what appears to be a bug with its ability to pass through HDMI video signals unmolested, even in \"Through\" modes. This bug manifests itself in two ways: 1. 24 bit sources (like cable hdtv) are upconverted to 30 bit when output on a display; AND 2. for some inexplicable reason, 1080p 24fps sources stutter intermittently as if a frame is dropped. The latter might be more noticeable to plasma owners whereas 120hz and 240hz LCDs might compensate for the frame stuttering with their interpolation software (ie the soap opera effect).With that caveat, the Onkyo is a terrific performer offering strong power (power consumption is up from the 607 to a very grown up 756 watts), terrific flexibility (four speaker terminals can be assigned to wide, height or zone 2). The Denon is limited to merely 7 speaker terminals and the Pioneer has only a pair of assignable terminals. The Audyssey auto-callibration (2EQ) is a notch behind Denon, but the inclusion of Audyssey DSX (for wide arrangements) is a feature that the Denon does not offer. While it lacks the USB terminal for Ipod playback of the Pioneer and the Denon, it does offer a computer input which might resolve the HDMI handshake nightmare many face with htpcs.Onkyo rather smartly included a fan atop of the receiver, which is silent and all but eliminates the historical Onkyo toaster oven effect.I really enjoy this receiver, but found the HDMI video molestation issues to quite problematic and what mar an otherwise incredible buy. Hopefully Onkyo can issue a firmware update.", "rating": "mixed"}

The hair on my dog's face wasn't nearly as sharp as it was coming from my E-510 with the same lens.I honestly thought that I was doing something wrong or I simply hadn't found the optimal setting for the E-30 yet so I tried turning the Noise filter off among many other things. I also tried adjusting the focus in-camera but that didn't work either; the images were still soft. I tried multiple settings and performed hours of tests comparing the E-510 and the E-30 to one another only to conclude that the E-30's image quality is simply not acceptable to me.The E-30's dynamic range, view finder, LCD screen, features, handling and auto white balance are FAR superior to the E-510s. The E-30 is a far  better camera in MANY ways.... except for sharpness.If you do not care about 100% image crop sharpness like I do, you will find that the E-30 is the camera for you. I researched why the heck the E-30 is so soft compared the E-510 and it turns out that the E-30 has a much stronger anti aliasing (AA) filter compared the the E-510 and this indeed appears to be the problem. This is not something I am willing to accept in my camera.I would rather shoot with the E-510 because of it's superior sharpness even though I will sorely miss the E-30's better auto white balance and better dynamic range - what a shame.

Sharpness is NOT something I'm willing to give up with my camera no matter how good it is and that is why I got rid of my Olympus E-30.Your experience may be different from mine but I know that I'm certainly not the only one who's been sorely disappointed with the Olympus E-30's sharpness.

The sides of the mouse which normally have a little grip to allow your hand to not slip on it is non-existent.  It is in fact just smooth plastic and nothing more.  Mouse itself is extremely light for better or worse.  But when you're first putting your hand on it it's awkward because your fingers slide on the sides, taking a second or two to get the correct position on it.  And it feels smaller than my other mouse (Logitech G9X).The other two gripes are trivial but would have been nice.1.  No way of storing the USB inside the mouse for traveling.2.  It doesn't come with a travel pouch.Things I like about it:Mouse functions work just fine.Has an on/off switch under it to conserve the battery.Granted, it's not labeled as a notebook mouse, but at $13.99, you can spend $1 more and get a much better quality Logitech M510 at a wallet-busting $14.99.If you're only reason for buying this mouse is for seeking silence, go for it.

I wanted to avoid the kind where you have to spray something on your device and opted for these after reading the good reviews. I have a lot of other devices with screen protectors (phones, MP3 players, tablets, etc), so I am pretty comfortable applying them. My Nook HD was brand new, out of the box when I applied the film. I also cleaned the entire table area and dusted down everything on and around the Nook until it was spotless. Still, the first film was like a dust magnet. One or two microscopic particles got under the plastic just as I began laying it down. This happens sometimes. Normally I just lift up the end and swipe away the dust with the included card (smoothing tool) and continue on my way. With this one, lifting the film up slightly to reposition it sucked in more tiny dust particles than exist in the known universe. I had to throw the first one away and try again. Screen protector 2 lasted about as long. You have to position it from the side without the N notch cut into it, so it's a bit fiddly to get right. I was a mm or so off, so I lifted it slowly to adjust it. The dust was less of a problem with the second film, only three or four little dots that I would try and get off somehow once I got the positioning right. But before I got the chance the exterior film peeled off the screen protector before I was done adjusting it. Bubbles appeared everywhere underneath and it was half-stuck to the bezel. I couldn't do anything with it after that and had to peel it off and throw it away. I was left with one more of my 3-pack. Trying my precision best not to waste the $10 completely, the third screen protector actually went on rather easily with no dust underneath at all and only a couple bubbles to press out. I guess it takes two wasted tries to get all the static cling to take in all microscopic bits of dust in a 2-mile radius before you get one clear shot. Now I have none left to replace it with and that's why I bought a 3-pack to begin with.PROS:-Minimal bubbling if you apply it in one smooth action (good luck)-Good screen hold-Very clear; no distortion-Still touch-responsiveCONS:-Difficult to apply-Difficult to adjust position during application (even though the packaging says you can)-Dust. Dust everywhere.-Actual screen protector does not fit the device exactly even when perfectly applied (slight gap around edges).

I looked around, did my research and decided that the ratings and reviews on this item were favorable enough to take a shot on it. I unfortunately have to report that it failed to work at all.

No dice. I then connected directly between my MacBook and the enclosure. No love. So, in short, I am unfortunately adding myself to the several 1 star reviews for this item.

{"title": "Simple device which works, but nothing special", "body": "I just got this last night. It is a Christmas present for my 18-month-old daughter. I set up Skype so we can talk to grandma, downloaded a bunch of videos, and installed a bunch of toddler games and kiddie music apps. If you have used a newer Android phone, you will be very familiar with this interface because it is almost identical and it was very easy to set up. All of my setup work went off without a hitch and it never crashed once (surprising for an Android)! As an added bonus, they included a screen protector, so they must have been paying attention to other reviewers who said that it needed one!For all intents, this will be a perfectly functional tablet for my toddler and because of the low price I won't have to worry if it gets damaged. I would have given it four stars but there are a few problems that I find worth mentioning, and they were enough to knock off a star:1. Internal memory is 1GB, NOT 4GB as stated in the product details. Thankfully, Apps2SD works on this tablet without rooting, and I already had a 32GB micro SD card from an old phone that mounted with no problem in this tablet, so I shouldn't run into much trouble with the limited onboard memory.2. Charger stopped working the first night. There are two ways to charge this tablet - through the DC charger port and through the micro USB port. I was originally charging through the DC port and for some reason it just stopped charging. I unplugged and re-plugged the charger but it still wouldn't charge. I can charge through the USB with no problem but it is something worth mentioning.3. Strange angle on the front facing camera. While testing Skype I noticed that the front-facing camera is angled up. That will be a slight inconvenience because one would typically hold this tablet on his/her lap and tilt it up to use the front camera. If you do that on this tablet, the camera will be aimed at your forehead, so it must be slightly angled downward to get a good angle with that camera. This is not an issue of my height because I am 6' tall.4. Poor viewing at an angle. The picture quality drops off rapidly as you tilt or turn the screen, so one must keep it close to perpendicular with ones eyes to get a good picture.I will come back and update if I find anything else worth mentioning, but so far it is a &#34;just ok&#34; tablet that will work for its intended purpose.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Has it got the beat? Maybe, maybe not", "body": "As I discovered upon reading the JBL Radial's troubleshooting instructions, these units seem to be unusually susceptible to interference from other consumer electronics.Most of my iPod music is exercise or dance music that plays well with headphones or through my car stereo. But when I initially plugged my iPod into the JBL Radial, every beat made a crackling noise. This seemed to happen no matter how low the volume was set. (I tend to keep the volume low since I live in an apartment building.)If I turned my iPod's bass booster on, the experience was like listening to Rice Krispies -- Snap! Crackle! Pop! When I turn my iPod's bass reducer on, all was well -- but who wants to listen to dance or exercise music with every hint of bass stripped out?The troubleshooting instructions suggested relocating a unit if it suffers from such crackling or popping noises, which might be due to interference. There were no sources of interference in my case, but perhaps the apartment tenants next door had equipment near our shared wall. Whatever the case, I moved the Radial to different positions in the same room, with no improvement in performance.Weeks later, I tried the unit again, and this time it sounded fine. But I'm concerned that the crackle and pop might return, and while I appreciate the troubleshooting instructions, wouldn't it make more sense for JBL to simply make the Radial less sensitive to other electronics?", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Get a Canon 40D instead.", "body": "Let me start by saying that I started as a Canon owner in DSLR world (Canon Rebel XSi 450d). That was my first camera, and I loved it. I intermediately tried a Nikon D90, owing to its apparently great noise performance and the punchy color rendition... only to realise Nikon lags a bit in LiveView implementation which was better even in an XSi.So I ordered a Canon 50d, hoping to get the liveview I wanted, PLUS a noise performance better that even the Nikon D90 (rival?).Now by this time I had tried a 450d and a Nikon D90.. and so I was surprised to find out that 50d nowhere matched noise performance of a cheaper Nikon D90! And I am not talking about per pixel performance.. I am talking about day-to-day indoor shooting results. Canon 50d images had a lot of chroma noise for same shooting conditions. I wont go into why the 50d images look so soft at pixel level.. because different people have different theories about that. But if end result is what matters, here are my 2 cts as an enthusiast photographer who also works in imaging field:- Canon 50d results can not match the Nikon D90 ones in colors (and YES I did struggle with the picture style editor - its not a simple linear transformation to go from Canon's RAW color space to Nikon's color space)- Nikon D90 allowed me to capture sharp indoor pictures in room lighting with minimal noise as compared to the Canon 50d. And I have images to compare.. not 1 or 2.. but hundreds.In the end, I realised that a better Canon 50d liveview may perhaps help me in technically getting good pictures... but a Nikon D90 gives me the end results that I love.. and love going back to look at. The difference is very subjective.. and has more to do with aesthetics than the technicalities. You have to go through both the cameras to understand that.Pros for a Canon 50d:- Solid built- 15 MP (do they matter anymore?)- Great dial interface- Bright hi-resolution LCD, with 30fps live view- The lens-specific auto-focus micro-adjustment feature is cool. I actually needed to use it with the first lens I purchased: A Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 which was terribly off-shooting.. by about 17 units (as seen on the calibration screen). However, I wasn't too sure I needed that feature.. since I am not a professional.Cons of a Canon 50d:- Noise performance isn't comparable to even cheaper models like Nikon D90. And no matter what you say about in lab tests and technical data, its the end result that matters. And I couldn't get the same results from a 50d that I could from a D90. Read more about independent noise tests on imaging-resource here: [...] Search for \"50D vs D90 Comparison\".- Very hard to get the punch out of the colors using just the picture style editor. The color transformations are unitary...you cannot rotate the whole color wheel or work on big sections of the color spectrum all at once.- Heavy. And I mean HEAVY with a good size lens.- A tad big for me.- PRICEY!!In summary:- if you have ~$1500 to spare for a new camera+lens kit (as of 1/27/2009),- if you like post processing to get the colors/shades you want- if you are a pro photographer with established liking for Canon's image quality- if you have a Canon 30d or below and have existing sizeable investment in Canon lenses,then Canon 50d is for you.If, however, you already own a Canon 40d, I dont think just extra MP and a brigher LCD will do you any good from a 50d. Plus a 40d may serve you equally or even better in terms of performance.Remember, there are always alternatives like the Nikon D90. And for $1500 (as of Jan 27, 2009), you can even get a 70-300mm VR lens with a basic 18-105 kit lens. It is a wonderful kit for an intermediate dSLR enthusiast.Whichever way you decide, I wish you luck in that you enjoy your purchase!Edited 03/24/2009: I have since tried a Canon 40D along with a Nikon D90. And comparing just the RAW images, my impression is that Canon 40D gives sharper and more detailed results compared to the Nikon D90.. given similar lenses and lighting conditions. The D90, however, has at least 1 stop advantage in usable ISO range, and has the vivid blues/greens in off the camera images that some people like.I can thus comfortably recommend a Canon 40D over the 50D, and along a Nikon D90. Reasons? Cheaper than a 50D, same price as a D90 (as of 3/24/09). Also, pro level Nikon glass is much more expensive than the Canons. Compare a 24-70 f2.8 or a 70-200 f2.8 between the two brands.In case you do decide to get a Canon 40D, you may want to check out my post on how to get Nikon like colors off a Canon40D here: prashchopra.blogspot.com/2009/03/getting-nikon-vivid-colors-from-canon.html .Good luck!", "rating": "mixed"}

However, if you just want a really fast usb drive to run a virtual machine off or transfer data quickly this device really isn't a good choice. You should go for the Extreme USB 3.0 by SanDisk. It's twice as fast and around the same price. Also, I have it clipped in my back where my books, notebooks, iPad, calculators and a bunch of other stuff are all rustling around and it has done fine with no dings or scratches so it's pretty tuff as well. So depending on if you want, a fast drive, or a bulletproof one. Also if you just need waterproof check out Centon's 2.0 it's faster than the Corsair's 3.0. I have ran a test on them and it took the Centon 2.0, 27 seconds to transfer a 1.5gb movie, the Corsair took 34 on the same file and I ran them both through the same USB 3.0 port and used the same SSD to test them with.

{"title": "Revised Review", "body": "UPDATE January 16, 2014 --- The day after I posted my negative review about these batteries from this seller they called me. They told me that replacement batteries are on the way and should arrive any day. I am impressed that they called me on their own, even before I tried to call them. That says something very positive about them as a company. I am hoping that the new batteries will work better than the old ones. I am changing my review from a one to a three depending on how the replacement batteries work. If they are good, I will rate them even higher. Thanks Big Mikes for being so responsive.UPDATE January 10, 2014 --- I thought this was a good deal. After using these batteries twice this is what I found:1) When I install the batteries in my Sony HDR-CX220 camcorder the screen initially says that I have 2 hours and 40 minutes of record time. They actually only record for one hour. That is LESS THAN THE SMALLER CAPACITY BATTERY THAT CAME WITH THE CAMCORDER!!!!2) One of the two batteries has bad contacts and it is useless. Every time I move the camcorder even slightly it disconnected and the camcorder shuts off. And by move, I mean any movement at all!So, I thought this was a good deal, but I was wrong it is totally useless.

{"title": "Grundig G3 vs. Tecsun 660", "body": "(Appears that the Grundig G3 and Eton G3 are same product) - I thought I received a defective Tecsun unit, because even plugged in, the unit was behaving erratically (hence I didn't expect it was the batteries).  It had been plugged overnight, but the unit was turning itself off after 20 seconds or so, and a few icons were flickering.  Resetting the unit, using a pin, didn't work.  I requested a refund and went out to buy a Grundig G3 at a local HAM radio shop and to pick up some alkaline batteries.  When I got home and inserted the alkaline batteries, the Tecsun appeared to operate normally.  I then compared the reception and sound quality of both units across the Air / SW / AM / FM bands.  The Tecsun has noticeably better reception, superior sound quality and depth (with a tone control for either bass or treble), less static buzz, and the volume seems 2 - 3 times as loud as the G3.  The Gundig has a nice RDS (Radio Data System) feature that displays the station, song and artist.  It also has a rubberized body that some may prefer to the Tecsun's plastic finish.  Both units have a quality feel about them.  Unfortunately, both units can hardly pick up any SW stations during the day here in San Jose from my 3rd floor porch, even with the external Sangean ANT-60 antenna plugged in.  I understand that ionospheric conditions favor the night due to higher bounce, but I expected more stations during the day nonetheless (disappointment for both radios).  The Sangean antenna would work better if I could string it optimally.  I was encouraged by the  alkaline batteries, and remembered that I had a battery charger stashed away.  I loaded the rechargeable batteries from the Tecsun (the recharger indicated that they were dead - even though I had them plugged into the Tecsun the prior night), and after a few hours they were fully recharged.  Once re-inserted into the Tesun, the unit is working fine as with the alkaline batteries.  I would recommend the Tecsun 660 over the Gundig G3 but caution buyers not to expect the unit to work right, even plugged in, until the rechargeable batteries are fully charged (use an external charger if necessary the first time).  I'll monitor this radio and report back if the unit isn't properly charging - so far though - so good.", "rating": "mixed"}

It will suit my needs - 'still waiting on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5A camera that's going in it so I can't judge the fit, but that's my fault and I expect no problems.What is immediately disappointing is the fact that the belt loop in back, though nice and solid in itself - there's apparently a reinforcing piece of flexible plastic built into the nylon for added stiffness and strength - is only sewn at the top.  The bottom of the flap is attached with just a Velcro closure with an opposing 1/2\" wide nylon flap with a standard metal snap.  This product bills itself as something designed to \"protect your investment,\" and the one thing I do not want to worry about is having bag, camera and memory card with pix on it torn off of my belt via a pickpocket or a stray tree branch.  It feels solid despite the detachability but... it's not something I want to have to worry about.The mitigating factor is that for 15 clams you can't complain about the product overall.Caveat Emptor alert: Another negative is that the included documentation states that \"Lowepro Proudly Supports\" four partisan, activist political organizations.

{"title": "Love TomTom, Despite Flaws", "body": "Although I only give TomTom 3 stars for this device, I really like it and I would purchase ONE XL again.For city driving, there is little to fault. This is my 3rd GPS, and compared to my archaic Garmin III+ and previous TomTom for Palm Treo, this is a beautiful unit. It is also one of the first electronic gadgets that my wife likes as much as I do. On a trip to San Francisco, it enabled her to leave me in meetings and set off alone across the Bay Area to visit her 90 year old aunt. The TomTom was wonderful, guiding her through freeway lane changes and complicated interchanges. Then it brought her safely back to the hotel -- all in an area so foreign to her, she did not know north from south, east from west.My problem with the TomTom surfaced on a recent road trip from Texas to Utah and Idaho. First, I noticed problems with the map around a couple of Texas State Parks in the Panhandle, Palo Duro Canyon and worse in Caprocks. The TomTom was insisting I route down roads clearly marked 4 wheel drive only, and when I went around Caprocks to the main entrance side, the TomTom indicated roads that were not there, and took me down a labyrinth of dirt roads through agriculture fields. I reached the destination, only to realize there is a nice paved road into the park that TomTom didn't route.An even worse problem surfaced in Northern Idaho. I lit out from Idaho Falls, assuming Yellowstone was further north on I-15. Wrong. I turn on the TomTom after driving half an hour, not figuring I needed it, but wanting to determine an arrival time. The TomTom quickly revealed I was on the wrong highway, so I routed East towards a little dot on the map - Kilgore, Idaho. That's then the trouble started. Once you get out on dirt roads, even those carrying state highway designations, the TomTom fell apart. Between Kilgore and Winter Park Idaho, the TomTom would have killed me if I paid any attention to it. Non-existent roads were prolific, and the voice prompts to turn become nagging. At times, when a road was present, it looked like something heading off into a cow pasture. Luckily, Idaho keeps the main road well graded and maintained, so it was obvious where to go. In fact, there are a lot of nice vacation homes in the area, so no real concern. But the TomTom database was a mess, so bad the features to allow users to give feedback on non-existent roads were utterly useless because errors were simply overwhelming.In balance, I highly recommend the TomTom if your travel plans don't include dirt roads.Also, I'll note that TomTom provisions to download map updates and application upgrades has dramatically improved over my previous GPS units.Major point for me: Macintosh support is excellent, totally first class. The Mac software is polished and easy to use.Other than outback map problems, I'd give the TomTom 5 stars!", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "There are Better Products Out There, and Better Service...", "body": "POSITIVES1. In terms of picture quality, I would rate this set above average.  Please note that I highly recommend a 1080p image over a 720p such as this one (particularly if you frequently watch blu-ray as I do), however the difference between the two is not very noticeable on a 32\" screen.2. The sound quality on this TV is pretty good (sometimes the built-in speakers can be terrible on these units).3. I also like the design of the remote, which is small and sleek.  For those who hate those large remotes with a hundred buttons that you never use, this is the remote for you!**********NEGATIVES1. All the important inputs, including HDMI, digital coaxial, and cable are all in the worst possible location - they are located at the very bottom of the TV, in the back, facing downward (see product photos).  I suppose this is okay if you are mounting the TV on a wall, but for those who want to use a TV stand it is a real nightmare to plug cables into the back.2. I frequently use a set of headphones while watching TV (so I don't disturb the rest of my family).  In every television I've ever owned, when you plug the headphones into the headphone jack, the TV automatically disables the speakers.  With this TV, that is not the case - the speakers continue to emit sound even after you plug in headphones.  It seems the only way to turn the speakers off is to use the \"Mute\" button (the sound still pays through the headphones)...  But whenever you go to adjust the volume, the \"Mute\" is disabled and the speakers turn on once again.  This makes it impossible to adjust the volume through the headphones without the speakers roaring to life.*EDIT* It is possible that I received a defective product, and so this may be a problem with my TV unit only.  I cannot say for sure, because multiple attempts to contact Haier about the issue have been unsuccessful.3. If you have a problem or need help with a product, it seems that Haier is not very responsive.  I wrote to Haier by email for product support (about the issue with the headphones).  It has been 5 days and I have not received a response.  This is too long... in my experience most electronics companies will respond to your inquiry in 48 hours or less.*EDIT* It has now been 15 days since I first contacted Haier, and have attempted to contact them again since.  They are non-responsive to emails.**********In closing, I was unfamiliar with the Haier brand when I was sent this television.  Upon further research, I learned that Haier is a Chinese company and is the world's largest producer of household appliances, and I guess they are looking to increase their TV presence here in the states - but they have a long way to go.All the essentials for general TV viewing are here.  But while picture and sound quality is at above average, there are many minor issues that prevent me from recommending this television.  If you are looking to buy a TV for video gaming or for a home theater, I would recommend a 1080p television from a more reputable brand.I believe that a TV is a serious investment, so why not spend a little more and get the highest quality product?", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "When price is more important than everything else", "body": "I own various brands of HDMI cables.  I needed a new longer cord to reach the back of my TV to my laptop so I could display my laptop on the TV, when needed.  I know I wasn't using my laptop as a main viewing device for my TV and it was mostly for things that didn't require great quality.  So, I got this cable based on my viewing needs.The one thing I have issues with is it doesn't always register that the cable is plugged into the laptop and TV.  It presents me with no connection for that input yet they are hooked up.  I have to keep unplugging and re-plugging the HDMI cable up to the laptop until it picks up the signal.  It gets a bit annoying but after a few attempts, it recognizes it.You may think maybe it's the HDMI port and not the cable but I used a higher quality cable and found that with each time I plugged it in, I got an immediate response.  I tested this many times and determined it was the cable, not the port, that was the issue as this issue immediately returned when using this cable.  I'm not an expert tester and just using my own knowledge to determine that it's the cable, but I guess there could be other factors that would cause this issue.  I just want to throw out that disclaimer.The picture looks OKAY but I can tell the quality isn't as good as with the other cable I tested against.  Was it worth not using this cable?

{"title": "Good for price, Not the best quality", "body": "So I bought this LCD 2 years back for $230 which I though was a steal for such a nice size LCD. After 2 years of gaming, watching movies, browsing, overall I am happy with the purchase, but I know my next monitor for sure will be an upgrade. I'll go over some pros and cons.Pro's:1. Price - Any 24\" LCD for ~200 is a great deal! The size is overwhelming at first, but then becomes comfortable and you always think you can go bigger ;)2. Features - Sure, it has HDMI, it has speakers (what you can expect from monitor speakers), it looks nice.Con's:1. Quality - It is not the most precise or accurate LCD out there. If you spend 400+ on a monitor with better specs, you'll see the difference instantly. This LCD does the job sure, I've WoW'd on this for years now, watched all my DVDs/divx, and done all my docs and web surfing, but it never really impresses me to the point where I'd say WOW!2. Noisy - if you turn the brightness up, you'll hear the buzz. As simple as that.3. Its 1920x1080, not 1920x1200, meaning 16x9 instead of 16x10. Not a big deal for most people, but that extra space on vertically would have been nice.4. Stand - cannot adjust the height of the LCD, only the tilt. For this price you cant complain and get everything.Overall, its a good LCD. Well worth the money, but if you have the cash, go for something better. I look at it like if you spend so many hours on something, its worth the money to spend on. If you drive 2 hours a day, get a nice car. If you drive 10mins a day, do you really need it? So if your having a WoW session for 10hours/day, get that expensive monitor and make it worth your time!", "rating": "mixed"}

My main drive is a Western Digital Green drive which is specifically made to be quiet at the expense of being somewhat slower.  Well, so far, this Hitachi seems as quiet, if not quieter, to me.  But it is definitely faster than my Green drive.All-in-all I am quite pleased.  Perhaps I will reformat my drives sometime and use the new Hitachi as the main drive.**UPDATE** After just a few months, the drive died and I had to send it in to get a replacement.

{"title": "reflection from inside can be bothersome", "body": "I agree with most of the good reviews about this TV, however, I do need to point out a major annoyance of the TV, which I think is a major design flaw and prevent me from giving it a 5 star instead.Although overall experience with the TV is positive, I noticed an annoying issue with this unit: it can reflect its own video from inside. This is more apparent if you are watching from side angle and image is contrasty - like white over black (i.e. texts over black background), you can see a shadow image being reflected from one inch down the screen surface. It is so obvious that you can notice it from 10 feet away. If you watch straight in front of the TV, you won't be able to detect this though.Given the price of this TV, I hope such annoyance should be not be there in the first place. I don't see such thing in other LCD TVs, let alone older CRT TV. This TV is otherwise an excellent one, with good video and audio quality. It is really a pity Panasonic did not get this right.There is another minor flaw: it does not decode DTS audio - I have a DVD player connected to HDMI input, if I change audio encoding to DTS, the TV is silent.

I also use a Windows PC, which I understand doesn't work as well.  But with that said ...Right off the bat, the installation is a pain.  You have to install several different applications that require numerous pluggings and un-pluggings of the Ipod.  At one point I was instructed to unplug the Ipod from the USB port and plug it into the power adapter, something about a firmware reboot, but what the heck, it should be able to get power from the USB, right?  Even the serial number is challenging for those of us over 40 ... you have to copy it from the back of the Ipod and it's there in low contrast 0.2 point font.I knew I was in trouble when I took the protective plastic sicky off the Ipod and printed on it was a long list of reminders about special multi-button-hold-for-a-while commands to do obscure things like turn it on and turn it off.  Basically the device has only one button and you just massage it in about 60 different ways to attempt to coax it into doing what you want it to do.But it doesn't really care what you want to do.  After you finally get the software installed and the Ipod plugged into your computer for the 13th time, it proceeds to take a tour around your hard drive, locate every obscure piece of junk song that happens to be there, and start downloading it to the Ipod.  I had no idea that stuff was there, don't really know where it is, other than it's now on my new Mini and I can't get it off.  I tried deleting the songs, but the Mini woke up and downloaded it all again.That's OK, when I tried downloading a CD that I owned, it took me 15 minutes to figure out that the file/import... command does something entirely different than the \"import\" button and the one that I wanted took forever to accomplish.  Does anyone with a real job have time to download their music collection onto a computer?It took me a while to figure out how to get that one button to adjust the volume, and then once I did I discovered that every time my finger came anywhere near the button the volume keeps changing.So ...

However, when I turned my TV back on, those 3 devices would flicker on for a second and then go back off, and the only way I could get them all back on was by turning off the entire surge protector for about 30 seconds.I found out that because my surround sound system has a sort of &#34;sleep&#34; mode, where you can turn it off but it doesn't power down completely, that when it was woken up by my TV, the surge protector would detect that it and all of the devices in the &#34;Controlled&#34; plugs were also still 'off.' The only fix I found was to actually power down the surround sound system before turning off the TV, which kind of defeats the purpose of an automatic power down. I really don't feel like that should have any effect on the other devices in the &#34;Controlled&#34; spots, but it does.I'm pretty disappointed since I was really excited about this surge protector and all of its positive reviews.

Gyeah!It's sort of a Leica. The camera is metal and has a retro-feel to it. I do like the simplicity of the dials. But it's made in Japan and it wouldn't take a die-hard camera-guru to tell you it's a souped up Panasonic.I feel like I bought a Lexus with a maserati emblem on it. It's really good, but I expected fantastic.NOISIER THAN A SLAYER CONCERT! My goodness this thing has trouble with dark lighting. Uggghhh.

Press the shutter, wait, wait, wait, think about what you might have for lunch tommorow, wait, wait, wait... okay. Picture time. If you want to take a photo of any sport faster than chess or catfish noodling, don't get this camera. 2 out of 10OVERALL PHOTO QUALITY.It does take good photos. It collects a surprising amount of detail. The focusing is ingenious (sp?) for a point and shoot, and the options are nearly unlimited (3 different ways to photograph babies! 2 different skintone options) THere is a brain in there. 9 out of 10!!!!!!!!!! I'd go 8.5, but the focusing is quite brilliant, i.e. depth of field.MANUAL SETTING.THe programming is nearly unlimited, you need to spend at least half an hour to an hour to read and understand all the different settings available. But, in manual mode, THERE IS NO FOCUSING RING! You merely push the button up or down to tell it to focus in or out (like cheap video cameras). Left and Right button control aperature, and there are film speeds to choose from (100-200asa for me, buddy). But no it's not manual in the sense one would expect from a \"swiss/german\" camera-smithery. 4 out of 10FLASHWow! 10 out of 10! Why? Because it's manual. When you want the flash, you press the MECHANICAL button and the flash MECHANICALLY pops up and the flash is in use. When you don't want the flash, you press it down MECHANICALLY. It's built in, of course, but it's not \"built-in\". And in baby mode, the flash reduces the flare and glare as to not burn second degree scars into the baby retinas.BUILD/FINISH/STURDINESSIt's metal! Just like those more expensive good cameras. It's satiny, and it has a big bright red logo that let's everybody know you only get the best things you can afford. YOur fancy, and you like to spend money! People will admire you more and treat you with respect. Just like a Gucci purse, or six hundred dollar sequined jeans that were ripped on purpose at the factory and sprayed with acidic bleach by robots. IF your REALLY materialistic and want everyone to think your a rockstar, this is the camera for you. THere is a fifteen thousand dollar gold Mamiya with diamonds on it, but I'd rather get the Hassleblaad h3 for that price.Just kidding, some people do just like really good cameras, like me.

Or for 170$  you could get a nice Sony, Panasonic, or Canon and spend the rest on a nice weekend roadtrip vacation and have something to take pictures for. And if you spent twice as much as this camera  you would have a real sweet digital SLR! But SIX HUNDRED BUCKS? FOR A POINT AND SHOOT? 5 out of 10. It is ten megapixels though.LCD SCREEN14 out 10. That's right 14 out of 10. The screen is so ridiculously nice and big, I could watch Lawrence of Arabia on it. I've seen airplane seats with smaller LCD screens. The screen is so frickin' nice, I'm terrified I bought a two hundred dollar camera with a four hundred dollar LCD screen attached to it. I wish the company had put the money and technology towards the sensor, the lens, and the overall sturdiness. 14 out of 10.LENS.Sweet lens. I'm not sure if it's german, swiss, or Japanese. But it's from one of the three and it is nice glass. Most point and shoots have lenses the size of Charles Manson's pupils, but it's impressive. I also LIKE the fact it doesn't fully retract into the camera. Most people probably don't like this feature, because it's bulkier and harder to store. But for the purpose of PHOTOGRAPHY, (the purpose of having a camera, duh), it makes for a better camera, that it doesn't retract fully back into the camera (which brings more afghan dust and somali sand in the camera). Maybe it even has SLR style mirrors in there? I don't know, I'm not an expert, I'm just a guy who OWNS and USES this camera. 9 out 10.

{"title": "Looks Great, But Somewhat Slippery", "body": "As an owner of the Galaxy S3 DualPro case before upgrading to the S4 I was really expecting for this product to match the 'grip' of the last case. Unfortunately, this case for the S4 is NOT the same feel as the last case. It's very smooth to the touch, leaving this with virtually no grip, especially when compared to the last one. I've even made sure to hold them both side by side and myself and friends agree, this case is not the same by a long shot. It's immediate when you put it in your hand. The feel itself is quite nice, but once you realize it doesn't hold to your hand, sort of makes it pointless. I'm not sure why they changed the feel when compared to the last one considering the last one for the S3 was perfect. Unfortunately, I'm now looking for another case that's stylish, but offers better grip.UPDATED 5/25/2013Just to elaborate on the grip a little more I imagine that Incipio likely decided to smooth out the material some to make it easier to get in an out of your pockets, which it definitely does slide out of my pocket a lot easier than than the S3 case, which I often have to use two hands because the material would stick to the inside of my jeans. I'm a smaller guy, though, and I'd rather deal with the phone sometimes getting stuck as opposed to using this phone with one-hand and when I have to stretch my thumb to reach the top of the screen (to use certain options in apps for example) the fact that the sides and back of the case are a bit smoother makes the phone often times slide down from my hand; not leaving me feeling very comfortable with it in those situations. Whereas the Galaxy S3 I never was concerned about that because it stayed in my hand nicely.Overall, you're basically sacrificing/gaining something when compared to the S3 case before it. On the one hand you gain a case that feels a little lighter, warmer to the touch (yes, the Galaxy S3 case is quite cold and this one is more neutral) and slides in and out of your pocket a lot easier. On the other, you lose some grip. If you have bigger hands that can reach all areas of the screen without having to adjust your grip on the sides (i.e. changing the position of your hand in regards to if you're holding it closer to the bottom or top of the screen) I imagine you won't have any issues with this case. If you have smaller hands and you do adjust your grip to sometimes reach the top then this case will likely make you feel a little uncomfortable at times as you wonder if it might slip out of your hand.UPDATED 5/30/2013I compared this case against the Spigen Neo Hybrid and Slim Armor and I feel that this case ties with the Slim Armor for different reasons and I wouldn't even recommend the Neo Hybrid. This Incipio offers more protection than the Spigen and will age better in terms of looks due to its soft touch finish. Whereas the Spigen has slightly more grip, but will age bad as its shiny coat is a fingerprint and scratch magnet and is slightly heavier than the Incipio.

{"title": "One observation not noted in other reviews", "body": "Most of the reviews already posted are typical of my experience using the radio transmitter feature of this product.  Probably due to FCC regulations, the transmitter power is low and prone to interference.  Living in the Chicago metropolitan area there is almost always a little background noise, kind of like listening to a casette tape back in the 80s.  One thing I have discovered that I did not see on another review is that the transmitter uses the wire between the Zune player and the cigarette lighter for its transmission antenna.  When I first started using the device I had the plug and wire inside the center console of my car and the results were terrible.  Fully extending the wire and stretching it out helps enormously.  I suspect this has something to do with the variation between reviews.  Fully extending the wire will result in a usably clear signal.  It is not as good as having an \"Aux In\" but it is certainly listenable.The device is otherwise well made and works as advertized.  Channel selection by \"seek\" or manual setting is easy and intuitive.", "rating": "mixed"}

It is too easy for the button to be pressed and for the battery to come loose in the bowels of your bag.3. Eventually one of the batteries cam loose and was lost. There is no way to get extra batteries ordered. I've tried for months. I would have expected this to be an easily accessible addon.4. The mouse does not have enough buttons. I'm not saying it should be a palm keyboard, but at the LEAST give me a back And fore key.5. The informational label comletely scratched off after a few month of play6. The fact that the receiver sticks out the way it does makes it impossible to carry around the charger and receiver coupled. This means that you have to continually:a. plug it in and out which weakens the connectorandb. raises the risk of losing the receiver or breaking if you forget to decouple it.It is with a heavy heart that I would have to recommend to users NOT to buy this mouse unless it is used with a stationary computer.

{"title": "Decent, entry level noise canceling headphones", "body": "This is my first pair of noise canceling headphones. I've owned a lot of headphones, and sound quality wise, these are just average.This is Maxell's 5th generation of noise canceling headphones. From reading reviews of the other headphones, these seem to be the best out of the 5.The phones come well packaged and have a hard, zipped case to store them in. The plug is detachable, which I really like. It's a standard 3.5 mm aux plug (for phones, mp3 players, etc), but the headphones come with an adapter to use them with a receiver, older stereo, etc.They take two AAA batteries. There are 3 listening options. &#34;Off&#34; is just the music through the headphones without anything additional. The next option is noise canceling, which removes some of the mids and highs. The third option is &#34;amp&#34; mode, which increases the bass, highs, and the volume.Overall, the &#34;amp&#34; mode is most pleasant sounding. The normal mode is desperately lacking in bass, so the added bass in amp mode is nice. The normal mode is very flat and boring - it just doesn't make your music &#34;pop&#34; like some good headphones do.The noise canceling mode is pretty good. I've used them while snowblowing, and it really does help you to hear your music better. I wouldn't use them at any other time though, because it does remove so much of the mids.The headphones themselves are quite comfortable. I have a large head and large ears, and they fit just fine. They have nice sound isolation, but don't get too hot. They're pretty light too, so I don't think these will be uncomfortable mowing the lawn or using them on long flights.Overall, they are adequate noise canceling headphones. You definitely can get better ones, but they get exponentially more expensive.", "rating": "mixed"}

I thought about the Panasonic/Lumix wide-angle cameras because they have slightly more manual controls than the Canons, but after trying one for a couple days, I wasn't happy with the picture quality.  I tried the Casio Z850, which I loved, but no wide-angle.  (But if you have to have manual controls and a tiny camera- that's the one for you).So I've settled for this guy.  I can't complain about picture quality, but I wish there were manual controls.  Also, the design leaves much to be desired.  The mode dial is difficult to use, the battery/SD door is difficult to open, and the door to the USB outputs, etc. is extremely difficult to close properly.  All I can say is that I'm happy I'll never open that later door again.So if you want wide angle in a small size, go with this.  Otherwise, I think there are better options.", "rating": "mixed"}

Now forgive me for the personal story, but it's where I can really tell the difference. I mow with my earbuds in. It's the only way to not hate mowing for so long, you need music! Well, my last pair was great, a different model and so great! So when they died after a year of use, I got these. So I put them on as I mowed and the first thing I noticed is that I can TOTALLY still hear the riding mower!!  LOL Yes, I know that is a weird review point, but I love to drown out the mower and just blast away the music.So, they don't play loud enough in my opinion. That's the biggest downfall. And just to let you know, I have used the same Sony Walkman MP3 (which I reviewed and still LOVE WAY MORE THAN IPODS) for years, so there is no difference in players. Same one. It's the headphones.Also, there is something just not quite right with the sound. It's not bad, but it's not like \"holy cow, these sound great!\" it's just...meh.  If you are getting these for a kid or for a pair to keep in the car or at the gym, go for it.  But I listen to everything from 80s music to Pavarotti and there just is not the fullness of sound on these. I have tried changing settings on my MP3 and nothing really helps.Lastly, the cords from earbud to where they come together is SUPER FINE. They are always tangled because the rubber or whatever coats them is almost..sort of..sticky. No, not sticky, but you'd have good traction if this material was used on shoes. Combine that with the super fine width of that part of the cord..I am just waiting for these to break. I am so careful with them and to their credit, they have held up so far.I hope this review helps :)  I would still buy Skullcandy, but I would really read a lot of reviews first.

Not sure if it's ready for prime time, especially for my target application:  the non-tech-savvy, poor-fine-dexterity in-laws.The one really big gotcha:  it copies the photos, but does not delete them from the card after copying them.  So what do you do when your card fills up?  You could plug the card or camera into a computer and delete pictures, but wasn't the point to avoid that?  You could wipe the card using the camera's UI, but are you sure you've copied all of the pictures?  (Besides, what if the reason you're doing it is that you've run out of space, and are away from home so you can't copy those last few pictures?)  My whole goal is to make the copy process be almost invisible, so that you just don't have to mess around with it... fail.Range seems quite limited.  Connection was iffy from my desk, perhaps 20 feet and a couple of walls from the router.  (My PDA connects fine from here.)  Since there's no UI on the camera, there's no way to tell that it's trying and failing to connect.As others have said:  The requirement for an Internet connection even for local copy is odd.  Not a problem for me, but odd.  Not copying videos:  Bad.Because the camera doesn't know what's going on, it might power off during the copy.  They have you \"optimize\" its power settings by disabling automatic shutdown.It's definitely not going to the in-laws.

I think if I were in the market for another one I would be more inclined to purchase a larger size simply because 6.5\" is actually pretty small when you get it set up and going.I don't claim to be a tech guru but I'm quite computer savvy so I thought the frame's controls would be pretty simple to set up. The quick start guide started off simple enough but quickly lost me. I struggled with the buttons and settings a little at first but was able to finally reach the point I could access the images and play around. I attempted to set up the date, time and alarm functions but I'm still not sure I ever got them right. All in all I feel that while the idea of a frame like this is a fabulous gift for grandma or an apartment dweller looking to save space this model is simply too complicated for your average user to figure out. I would not recommend this to anyone who is not above average in the tech savvy department.I both put in a memory card and transfered photos onto the frame through it AND connected the frame to my computer to nab some from my files. Both of those were actually a lot easier to do than any of the set-up stuff but the frame itself does not hold very many photos. If you're buying this planning to keep more than 5-6 pictures I recommend buying a memory card to keep in it so you can have enough room to really make this frame worth your while. I conducted an experiment in testing it out where I took JPEG files from my computer and put them on it to see what would work. My friend and I had a good chuckle as I loaded screenshots taken from an MMORPG I play, a couple of celebrity photos and pictures of my cats. They all ran through smoothly and looked good.Overall I rated it a 3 star because in my honest opinion this frame was just okay. I think there are better models out there for those who aren't very good with gadgets and certainly prettier frame styles. This would probably be a good one for a college student who knows how to do all this stuff and needs space in his/her dorm room.", "rating": "mixed"}

We took this nuvi on our last vacation to the rockies and it gave us mixed results.  It was sometimes slow to give turning instructions.  For instance, there were 2 exits in front of me within 200yds of each other.  The nuvi said turn right just as I was beside the first exit.  This one or the next one?  I turned at the 2nd and I was suddenly off course.  This happened at least 3 times where I missed my turn.  The integated unit on my Ford gives you a countdown of when you need to turn (1 mile, 1/2 mile, 1/4 mi., turn now) which works better.We preprogrammed our destination while at home and after getting our rental car at the airport we set our destination from the favorites.  The nuvi told us we were 180 mi from our destination.  Wrong.  We knew we were only 35 miles away.  We had to erase the destination and re-enter it before it would take us to the right place.  I still don't understand that one.The instruction manual is online.  While on vacation, I wanted to know how to get to specific screens and since I didn't print the manual, I was at a loss as to how to get the info I wanted.  An instruction booklet would be nice garmin (hint hint).The voice recognition works good as long as you speak slowly and clearly without a lot of background noise.The volume is a bit on the weak side but adequate.  Haven't tried bluetooth yet as my phone (palm pre) isn't supported.  C'mon garmin, this phone has been out for over 6 months.  Garmin sez it's Palm's issue????Other than the issues above, the unit worked nicely.  It only takes a few seconds to get a fix.

The Voyager is much more comfortable, I've worn it for 18 hrs+and for got it was there.*The volume is excellent, one of the best as far as being able to hear the other person speak.

Same for the Voyager*Pairs easily and connects to the phone very well (automatically), Voyager does a good job as well.*It talks to you on start up and tells you the condition of the battery and if your connected to a device by the name of the device.  The Voyager just tells the battery condition.*You can have 2 different phones connected to this head set.  So can the VoyagerThings I really dislike about the Command One:*Battery life is ok, 6 hours max with above average use.  I can go all day with heavy use on the Voyager 12-14 hours.*Noise canceling compared to my old Voyager is not even close, the Voyager blows the Command One away, way far away!*Wind noise is terrible, even my old Voyager isn't to great with wind but it's much better than the Command One.*Command One 1st party Voice quality (my voice) when talking to a 2nd party is \"average\" according to my friends and customers, the Voyager voice quality 1st Party is excellentwhen compared to the Command One according to my friends and customers.*Motorola's voice dialing and text to speech software is a complete joke, garbage is a better word for it.  It works about 20-25% of the time.  I removed it from my phone.For the money spent on the Command One, $130.00 when it came out, the Plantronics Voyager Pro blows this head set away.  Although the Command Oneclaims to have voice activated dialing and Text to speech, Motorola just hasn't got this right.  The Voyager has a second party weird texting software called \"Vocalyst\" it's a joke as well.I've owned some older jaw Bone head sets that were about average but so far the Voyager has been the one that works for me.....

The slide out keyboard is easy to use. Unfortunately little else on the n810 works well. The GPS maps that come with the unit are poor. For example, they show the creek near my house, but not the street in front of it. You have to pay extra to make the GPS functional. There are some connectivity issues, as well. The n810 will not work with gotomypc, or even rdesktop. Because it lacks an appropriate Linux client, the n810 will not link to my university's vpn so I cannot access its wireless services. This means that the n810 is useless to me at school and work. Also, some regular web videos, such as CNN and Cnet will not play smoothly. (You Tube videos play wonderfully, however.) The other software works \"sort of\". For example, the Palm emulator, Garnet VM, is still in beta; therefore, some of my Palm apps work ok on the n810, but many do not, and I could not sync it with my Palm to get the addresses and calendar moved to the n810.

I just really wish that the designer of the case could have more communication with Alienware people, and put it in the wrong place that he do it. ok, is less than 2 inches but the grill is too low and while a lot of unnecessary part of the laptop is on the grill, just the half of the ventilation fan has access to the grill. so you are loosing 50% of the usefulness of the grill. awesome idea, bad design location.where the case has the really catastrophic flaw is in the general usefulness. the only thing that I could get to my mind is, buy this case if you want a super cool looking and better protector sleeve. because between a sleeve and this case, those and the carry belt and the carry grip are the only differences. you get absolute nothing of really useful space or pockets to carry anything useful, well, maybe your pen and of course, if you are a credit card guy, you will love this.have a mouse?, forget it, I use the Razer Orochi, one of the tiniest mouses that ever made, and even without the cord, he just has no place on the case. and of course, think in the AC adapter is just a cruel joke.of course in extreme case maybe the ac adapter that comes with the m11 could fit really tight in the \"external pocket for accessories\" (the nylon mail cloth under the case), but nothing more. inside has 6 compartments for standard cards, credit cards assume since the m11 has no pcmcia slots. one slot for presentation or business cards (the same as the other slots but with a transparent plastic windows), and one slot that looks more for a passport than a card. a huge pocket for papers, and a hidden pocket for more papers or maybe a notebook, agenda, whatever. and of course, a pen holder for your pen. not a single pocket for memory cards like SDHC or CF, or maybe a pocket for an external CD/DVD-RW like my Samsung SE-S084. anyway even with the pocket, will simply not fit for the lack of space so forget fill the card/papers slots because you will not close the case.at the end you just get a really heavy, cute, nice looking and tough sleeve, but forget it if you want to do a long or even a mid travel. this is just for get your m11 form home to school or places like that.Ill give 1 stars as a laptop bag but 5 stars as a laptop sleeve so 3 stars its fair. this product can be improved a lot but designers must choose first what they want, a sleeve or a case.", "rating": "mixed"}

I'm giving it 4 stars for quality, but for organization I would give it a 2 or 3.This bag is about the same external dimensions as the much loved but now discontinued Urban Disguise 30, however it holds far less gear due to the sloped corner at the top and the compartment dividers that only go halfway up.  That makes it impossible to stack layers of lenses with a divider between them, which also greatly limits the amount that can be carried.  I pretty much maxed it out with my Olympus OM-D E-M5 with Panasonic 12-35 attached, a Panasonic 35-100 to the side of it, and a Panasonic 20mm pancake.  No room anywhere for my Panny 7-14, or Oly 75 1.8 and 60mm macro.  The front flap seems silly also, and the pouches in the front pocket are very minimal.For me, this bag is not big enough internally to hold a decent mirrorless kit for travel, even though the exterior dimensions should allow for that.

They are very comfortable in the ear, and even without the Active Noise cancelling turned on, they block a fair amount of noise.3. the battery life appears to be quite good, as I had 30+ hours and they were still going strong.CONS1. The attached controller is heavy enough to pull the earbuds out of your ears if it slips, which mine did several times.2. The sound was great, but the microphone would turn on, randomly, and only in the left ear.  I'd be dozing, and then be jarred awake by the amplified ambient sounds.  It was a pretty good spy mike, though, as I could hear every word the flight attendants were saying, even though they were speaking softly.

Perversely, turning it off and then on again did not work; I had to yank the battery and replce it.4.

While it never received beyond mediocre ratings here at Amazon, it has remained my FASTEST (and by a pretty wide margin at that), most stable, and dead simple to use router to date, no matter the price or feature set. I have reviewed it and all the others so won't clutter this review, they are easy to find if interested.I am not a power user in the sense of being tech savvy and utilizing a ton of features. I am a person who wants & needs steady, fast, reliable signal that doesn't drop out constantly, suffer inconsistent \"mood swings\" on speed & performance. I don't care if it runs hot, cold or cooks my breakfast. I NEED steady service for my uploads (video) and for my gaming. I don't want to have to thing too much either since I am now disabled, retired and prefer to drink beer, game, and spend my time at the beach when able. So to this router, I have to say it is as simple as can be to set up if lazy like me.1-I unplugged my modem2-I plugged the power source into this router3-I connected this router with supplied cable to my modem4-I waited a minute5-I now turned my modem back on6-Once everything woke up and the modem saw the new router I opened my web browser (Google Chrome)7-I browsed the new on screen interface that magically appeared for me to set up as I needed.I changed the name of my router, gave it my new passwords and tweaked a couple items like QOS and went back to my beer and games. What surprised me was the slight drop in speed. I go back & forth between all of my routers, all my different brands and my old Cisco-Linksys E2000 Advanced Wireless-N Router simply smokes them all, even my E3000. I have no idea why. I wish it didn't since I would prefer a dual band simultaneous router. And this is where this new D-Link outperforms my E2000. Where my Linksys gets smacked is when I am uploading to YouTube in the background on 1 computer, gaming on the other while my zillion gigabyte files are spending 2 hours even on FAST COX Cable uploads, my wife is watching something on 1 of our 2 ROKU boxes....well, you get the idea. Now HERE is where my Linksys starts to get overwhelmed, slows a bit and THIS D-Link flat stays about the same as it was on a single task (slow...).  So for web browsing or just a single task moment like a large file upload with am HD Video for example, I just use my Linksys. But if I have in a busy day doing it ALL? I jump sometimes right back to this router. I am simply not smart enough to explain to you (or me either) why my routers act this way They just do. So every single time I see any router on Vine available, I will dive on it in hoes to someday, find a single router that will do it all, and not play games with ME in the process.....I am truly mystified as to why this new D-Link is so SLOW?NOTE: A speed test at the end of this review shows:On This router=23.91 MBPS Download speed-----5.23 MBPS Upload speedLinksys E2000= 32.52 MBPS Download Speed-----5.23 MBPS Upload speedEvening BUSY time for COX:On This router=7.50 MBPS Download speed-----1.87 MBPS Upload speedLinksys E2000=21.91 MBPS Download speed-----5.31 MBPS Upload speed", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Good for the Price", "body": "Sound quality is okay. Only cons are the magnet is so weak, they dont hold together well as a sound bar, and if you use the headphone jack with earbuds, the earbuds get so hot you cant keep them in your ears. Tried several pairs of earbuds that I have never had an issue with, and they all did it when plugged into these speakers. Still good speakers for the price.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Great view at day, bad view at night", "body": "Been using this mirror for past 3 days. Overall, it's an \"OK\" product. You can see clearly during the day, but when you are recording at night, the images are not clear. Lights look like snowballs and if you are driving on a road that has no street lights, you don't see anything even when your headlights are on. Signs are not readable at night. Its all one big blur when recording at night.The mirror is somewhat tinted too. Its darker than the standard mirror built in your car. Also the camera is not adjustable. Its fixed in one position. My camera is viewing more to the right than the center. If I adjust my mirror to center the camera, I would only see the right half on my rear window.Hopefully this company is working on a better version of this mirror. I suggest they find a way to make the camera record better at night and make the camera moveable. They should put the SD card slot on the side instead on top. There's not much space to take the card out on top.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Good while they lasted", "body": "The pros: Great headphones out of the box, and even better after burn in. I'm no audio expert, but these are better than the standard headphones you get with iphones. Can't say night and day, but better. Accessories, especially the airplane headphone adapter is a plus.Negative: While its my fault, I definitely don't prefer the silicon earbuds. No matter what size, just didn't fit right in my ear. Constantly pushing back in, but more so when working out or jogging. Not terribly uncomfortable, but I thought Apple IEM were better. And worst of all after one month, one ear phone stopped working. I noticed this happened to one other individual who wrote a review here. I returned to Amazon for a refund.I will be looking at a different IEM, but these are hard to pass up for the price.  May want to get an IEM with optional foam buds or something like Ety's.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "Not what I wanted", "body": "Due to a bad experience installing a screen protector by this vendor on my Galaxy S3, I will be returning this unopened.That protector was somewhat difficult to install, and I didn't like the material when I got it installed.

{"title": "Great for streaming, ok for downloads to mobile devices.", "body": "I have two quad tuner Tivos and this device. This device does what it advertises, but a few things to make clear:1.  This is not like a slingbox. It will not stream live TV outside your home-- only inside your home.2.  It does act as a bridge to download things from your DVR and convert/download them to mobile devices like iPhones/iPads3.  It does everything advertised...With a couple caveats that are important to know:A> The device fan can be loud. This seems to vary from device to device.  The fan runs ALL the time, not only when the device gets warm. I personally have it on a WEMO so I can easily shut it off when not in use.B> The conversion process is not all that fast. If you download something 30 minutes on high quality it could take 15 minutes to convert & download it to the device. Sometimes a download can be mostly done and fail, and you have to start over. This is not frequent but it happens.If you buy the device and it can keep you from having to pay for a Hulu subscription or per-show fees from app stores, it would be well worth the tolerance of the sound it makes and slowness of downloads.  If you have to get it from your cable company and pay a $10 monthly fee, it may or may not be worth your time.If you have any specific questions please feel free to ask them and I'll answer ASAP.", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "buy something else ...", "body": "First of all, I did not buy it from amazon, I am one of the loyal fans of amazon as to buying great stuff and receiving excellent services from,I purchased this projector directly from Dell.com in Jan. 2013, the common focus problems were identified right after the purchase, I thought that I could tolerate the out-of-range focus issue which only happens on the edge of display, essentially I do not want to spend too much time on calling dell. But after several usage (less than 10 times, and less than 20hrs operating), the symptom became worse and worse. The color is just not right (which I did not complain to the DELL CS, I believe that it's the hardware shortage due to the limited physical design-space either from engineering perspective or the manufacture cost ),Okay, The biggest headache is the focus, whatever I'v tried to adjust the focal length, it NOW can't get things nearly right, when center is focused, everything on the edge will be completely vague.  I could not tell clearly what text is no matter how I change the projector distance,another headache is that the projected image is not a perfect rectangle, I tried to tune the angles of the device to which the lens is pointing in all directions, it delivered a \"trapezoid\" image to me, what a awful product!!Within the warranty, I called the DELL customer service in September, and was told that they can only ship a refurbished unit to me to replace this one, I am very disappointed, and reject the option. I guess that I will just give this one to my relative and seek another one,", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Not bad, but no front protection", "body": "This is a relatively decent fitting case for the iPad Air.  The home button works well, but perhaps a little too well - as it tends to constantly get mashed even when you don't want it to be mashed.  This is probably a common problem for all cases of this design.  The case is very rugged and will protect the iPad from a LOT of abuse, but there is one key factor that has it lacking for me, and that is the lack of front screen protection.I had been using a Kensington case with a keyboard (which had already lost a key and had a magnet clasp that was smacking the screen constantly) and I decided to try this case instead.  I was hoping the adjustable angles would work well for me, but I didn't really consider the fact that it doesn't have a front cover.  Now I know that is pretty obvious, but it is easy to get tunnel vision when you are shopping and I was interested in the rubber case and the adjustable design.Sadly, the adjustable design isn't great.  It is clunky and doesn't lock into place as well as I had hoped.  It also attracts dirt, dust and hair and gets messy very fast on the back where the stand is located.  And while they do provide you with a front screen protector (the stick on and pray you don't have a grain of sand or a small hair underneath kind) the case doesn't really provide any screen protection in a fall.I have had the iPad, Ipad3, and iPad Air and I have dropped them and made every mistake known to man, but I've never busted a screen.  I have friends who are on their fourth and fifth screens on ONE iPad.  I attribute this to usually having a case that has a front cover on it.  I think that I need a front cover.  So, I am going to try the Belkin Stripe Tab Cover and see how it fares.  I'll post a review there once I try it out.Frankly, this is a little clunky, a little cheap feeling and not protective enough for me - your mileage may vary.  I hope that I have helped in your search for the ideal iPad Air case.  :-)", "rating": "mixed"}
{"title": "mediocre at best", "body": "I am puzzled and confused by the Amazon reviews, which I have come to trust on most products.  This product is clearly better than my Gateway laptop speakers but in no way should be considered good sound.  It plays louder, true, but has NO bass and the upper highs are not crisp.  It has the distinctive tin can sound of cheap speakers.  Maybe my expectations were too high but I expected more from Logitech.  While I do not regret buying this item, I feel it should be priced at $30 TOPS!  The good:  it is plug and play.  The clips system has rubber surfaces and works well.  Sound is sufficently loud but again, is not going to impress anyone.  To put things in perspective, I don't think any desktop non-powered speakers could sound any worse than this does.  However, I guess size and portability have clear tradeoffs.Alternative:  Wally's sells the Kinyo ArtDio sound bar which is smaller and only costs $12.  Pros:  has better high frequencies, speakers are directly aimed at you, much cheaper (and better value), more portable.  Cons:  less volume, less bass, rests on top of your laptop instead of grabbing the top.", "rating": "mixed"}

{"title": "Decent to Good Sound", "body": "3 stars because I'm picky when it comes to \"good\" sound.At around the low $200's, this is a pretty nice AirPlay wireless speaker.  At around $300, it's getting into Bose territory and I haven't had a chance to listen to the Soundlink II yet.  At it's list price of $549, it would definitely not be worth it.  At that price, the Klipsch SB-1 Sound Bar is a much better speaker ($450-$500 when on sale), but it's not mobile and compact and you'll need an Apple TV or Airplay compatible receiver to do the same as with the G-17.There is definitely some kind of equalization being applied in the G-17, but it's not detrimental.  I can definitely hear the bass guitar rift more prominently in the music that I generally listen to (not the boom boom kind), but as with most speakers this small, it does leave me wanting in the bass area.  Maybe Klipsch should also sell a wireless subwoofer that can pair with it???There have been a couple of times where the sound has cut out, but comes back pretty quickly when streaming from my iPhone.  I haven't tried to play music so loud as to distort it (I do like my music relatively loud sometimes), but it seems to handle somewhat high volume well.  Right now, I have it in the kitchen.", "rating": "mixed"}

I switched the computer and called Comcast but still ended up with the same problems. it was the modem that was the problem. i didn't have any problem with Comcast replacing it for free though. they gave me a Scientific-Atlanta Inc. modem, so time will tell if this one does the same. don't worry though if you had bought one.

The pairing of the keyboard and the actual transmission of key presses is great and worked without fail. The primary issues I had with this case was that the keys were close together and fairly uncomfortable to type on if you have larger fingers/hands, the other issue i had was the case design itself cause the edges of the aluminum case to press into your palms/wrists while typing. The only way to avoid this was to adopt a lifted wrist approach to typing that proved to be very uncomfortable for prolonged typing. The piece that actually props up the iPad is made of plastic and I have serious doubts on the longevity of the stand.", "rating": "mixed"}
