# Comprehensive Introduction to Machine Learning

- This represents a self contained comprehensive introduction to all of the fundamentals related to statistical learning and deep learning. Over the course of 5 years or so, I've compiled resources from online courses I've taken. I've filled gaps by finding resources on github, adding them to this repository. 

- Unit 0 - Basic Math
- Unit 1 - Introductory Concepts
	* This contains lessons that are more data science oriented. Very basic concepts to get started with topics like data manipulation model evaluation concepts. 
- Unit 1.1 - Data-Viz
	* Being a data scientist means understanding data visualization. This contains a ton of resources for that including examples of complex vizualizations.
- Unit 2 - Statistical Methods
	* As the name implies, this is oriented towards basic statistical concepts such as bayesian inference.
- Unit 3 - Basic Algorithms
	* ML is computationally intensive, more so than classical statistical inference. Therefore you need a basic grasp of the algorithms used for things like classification.
- Unit 4 - Advanced Algorithms
	* This contains more difficult algorithms
- Unit 5 - Deep Learning
	* This serves as an introduction to the fundamentals of deep learning. This is a coursera class. 
- Unit 6 - Sequence Models
	* This focuses on deep learning for sequence data, such as time series and decision problems found in reinforcement learning.
- Unit 7 - NLP
	* Intended to be a comprehensive introduction to NLP methods
- Unit 8 - ML Ops
	* You need to be able to do this in a production environment to get value
