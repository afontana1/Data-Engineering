Information
===========

This is a simple python HTTP multithreaded server which supports uploads. The
following operations are supported:

- `GET path/to/file` will return the content of path relative to the directory
the server was started from.

- `GET path/to/dir` will return the contents of the directory relative to the
directory the server was started from. The contents are returned in json
format: a dictionary whose keys define the filenames of childs and the value
is the type of the child: either `directory`, `file` or `other` string
specifying the type of the member.

- `PUT path/to/file` will upload a file to the path relative to the directory
the server was started from. Any existing directories are automatically created.
PUT fails if the given path identifies an existing directory or creating needed
directories would overwrite an existing file.

The server supports serving multiple streams concurrently. This is useful if
the server will serve many concurrent large streams over slow connection

Usage
=====

Just start the server by command line:

    python3 server.py

In case the default number of concurrent connections is not enough, increase
the number of listener threads:

    python3 server.py --threads=8

The server implements a simple permission system. Users authenticate via HTTP
Basic authentication. The permissions are stored in a python file (see below):

    python3 server.py --access_config ../perms.json

The server must be put behind a SSL reverse proxy in order to protect
credentials and uploaded or downloaded from exposure.

The following shows full list of accepted command line arguments:

    usage: server.py [-h] [--access_config ACCESS_CONFIG] [--log_headers]
                     [--log LOG] [--threads THREADS]
                     port

    positional arguments:
      port                  The port to listen on

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --access_config ACCESS_CONFIG
                            Path to access config
      --log_headers         If set logs headers of all requests
      --log LOG             Path to log file
      --threads THREADS     The number of threads to launch

Permissions
===========

The permissions and user authentication information are specified via a json
file. The server expects to be supplied with user and password via HTTP Basic
authentication. If HTTP request specifies user and the user is not found in the
database or the password does not match, the request always fail. If no
authentication information is supplied then the server assumes user "*" as far
as permissions are concerned.

Three permissions are supported: "read", "list" and "write" which correspond to
"read file", "list directory" and "upload file" operations. Whether a particular
operation is supported depends on what permissions are specified for the path
in question and its parent paths.

The permissions are determined as follows:
 - if the current path has permissions for the current user, then:
    - "r", "rw", "rl", "rwl" allow read file operation
    - "l", "rl", "wl", "rwl" allow list directory operation
    - "w", "rw", "wl", "rwl" allow upload operation
    - "" allows neither
 - otherwise, if the current path has permissions for the user "*", then
    - "r", "rw", "rl", "rwl" allow read file operation
    - "l", "rl", "wl", "rwl" allow list directory operation
    - "w", "rw", "wl", "rwl" allow upload operation
    - "" allows neither
 - otherwise, the permissions set for the parent path determines whether the
   operation is allowed.

Note in particular, that permissions set for a different user, except `*`, are
ignored. By default the user "*" has no permissions.

The format of the json file is as follows:

    {
        "paths" : [
            { "path" : "<path-to-file-or-dir>",
              "user" : "<user>",
              "perms" : "<permissions>
            },
            <...>
        ],
        "users" : [
            { "user" : "<user>",
              "psw" : "<passphrase>"
            },
            <...>
        ]
    }

 - `<path-to-file` specifies path relative to the server start directory to
    apply permissions for. `.` specifies the server root (the start directory
    itself).

 - `<user>` specifies the name of the user. All users used in the `paths`
    section must be listed in the `users` section. Listing the default user `*`
    is optional.

 - `<permissions>` a combination of `r`, `w` and `l` characters specifying the
    permissions.

 - `<passphrase>` the passphrase of the user. Pick a complex passphrase if the
    server is exposed on the internet because no measures against bruteforcing
    are implemented.

An example permission file:

    {
        "paths" : [
            { "path" : ".", "user" : "*", "perms" : "r" },
            { "path" : "test", "user" : "testuser", "perms" : "w" }
        ],
        "users" : [
            { "user" : "testuser", "psw" : "testpass" }
        ]
    }
