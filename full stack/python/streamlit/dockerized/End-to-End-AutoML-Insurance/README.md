## Overview - Business Aspect
- Cross-selling in insurance is the practice of promoting products that are complementary to the policies that existing customers already own.
- The goal of cross-selling is to create a win-win situation where customers can obtain comprehensive protection at a lower bundled cost, while insurers can boost revenue through enhanced policy conversions.
- The aim of this project is to build a predictive ML pipeline (on the Health Insurance Cross-Sell dataset) to identify health insurance customers who are interested in purchasing additional vehicle insurance, in a bid to make cross-sell campaigns more efficient and targeted.


## Overview - Technical Aspect
- Traditional machine learning (ML) model development is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and requires a high degree of technical expertise along with many lines of code.Â 
- This model development process has been accelerated with the advent of automated machine learning (AutoML), allowing teams to generate performant and scalable models efficiently.
- An important thing to remember is that there are multiple components in a production-ready ML system beyond model development that requires plenty of work.
- In this comprehensive guide, we explore how to set up, train, and serve an ML system using the powerful capabilities of H2O AutoML, MLflow, FastAPI, and Streamlit to build an insurance cross-sell prediction model.
