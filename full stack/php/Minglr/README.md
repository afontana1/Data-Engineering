Certainly! Here are the modified installation steps including installing and configuring XAMPP and changing the directory to `htdocs` before cloning the GitHub repository:

## Setting up the project (developer)

Follow these steps to set up Minglr locally using XAMPP:

1. Install XAMPP:
   - Download and install XAMPP from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) based on your operating system.
   - Launch XAMPP after the installation is complete.

2. Configure XAMPP:
   - Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
   - If these services do not start, you may need to change the ports for Apache and MySQL in the XAMPP settings.

3. Clone the GitHub repository:
   - Head over to C:\xampp\htdocs in your Windows Explorer. (If you installed XAMPP in a different location, you will need to navigate to that folder instead.)
   - Open the terminal or command prompt in the same folder.
   - Execute the following command to change the directory to `htdocs`:
     ```bash
     cd C:\xampp\htdocs
     ```

4. Clone the repository:
   - Execute the following command to clone the GitHub repository:   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mayuresh-22/Minglr.git
   ```

5. Create and Configure the Database:
   - Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
   - Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in a web browser to access phpMyAdmin.
   - Create a new MySQL database by clicking "new" option on left sidebar. Name it `minglr`.
   - Import the database schema from the provided SQL file (`db/database.sql`).
   - Update the database configuration in [`db/connection.php`](db/connection.php) with your database credentials (For example: LOCALHOST, USERNAME, PASSWORD, DATABASE). Follow this step only if you have changed the default database name or credentials.

6. Start the Development Server:
   - Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services (If not already started).
   - Launch a web browser and visit `http://localhost/Minglr` or `http://127.0.0.1/Minglr` to access Minglr.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Minglr on your machine.

Please note that the steps may vary slightly based on your specific operating system and XAMPP configuration. Make sure to adjust the paths and commands accordingly.
