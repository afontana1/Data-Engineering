## Project Structure

Minglr's codebase is organized in a structured manner to make it easier to navigate and understand. Here are the key directories and their purposes:

- `/`: This directory contains the source code for the Minglr application. You'll find the PHP files that power the backend of the social networking site.

- `/back`: This directory contains the code for connection, env, logout, and search files.
  
- `/db`: Here, you'll find the SQL file (`database.sql`) for setting up the database schema used by Minglr and the connection and validation file.
  
- `/error`: In this directory, you will find HTML files for error
  
- `/style`: The public directory stores assets like CSS, and JavaScript.

- `/uploads`: Here, you will find all the images uploaded by the users on the platform.

## Technologies Used

Minglr relies on several technologies to deliver its functionality. Understanding these technologies can help you navigate the codebase more effectively:

- **PHP**: The primary backend language used for server-side logic.

- **HTML5 and CSS**: Responsible for structuring and styling the front end.

- **JavaScript**: Enhances user interaction and provides dynamic features.

- **MySQL**: The database management system used to store and retrieve data.

## How Minglr Works

Minglr provides several key features, including user registration, profile management, news feeds, post creation, private messaging, and more. To better understand how these features are implemented, consider exploring the following components:

- **User Authentication**: Check the code for user registration and login in the `/db/validation.php` directory.

- **Profile Management**: Investigate the logic related to user profiles in the `/accpunt.php` file.

- **News Feed**: Examine how news feeds are generated and displayed in the `/feed.php` file.

- **Post Creation**: Learn how users can create and interact with posts by reviewing the code in the `/post.php` file.

- **Private Messaging**: Discover the logic behind private messaging in the `/pvtmsg.php` file.
