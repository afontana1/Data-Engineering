## Description
This is a Django app that, when deployed, will display all the projects I have created and also has a significant blog portion to it.
For the blog, you can click on the categories and get all of the posts from that category. You can also comment. I have also added a registration and user functionality so that you can create an account and post blogs as that user. You also can access a page with all your blog posts.

### Technologies and Languages Used
- Django
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap

## Motivation
I wanted to delve deep into Django and learn it's inner workings. I was familiar with Flask and wanted to see what Django had to offer. I learned a lot from [RealPython](https://realpython.com/), which had invaluable information, and, of course, the documentation for Django is phenomenonal.

## Stretch Goals
1. Expand the login to allow multiple users to write blog posts
2. Move the database from sqlite to PostgreSQL
