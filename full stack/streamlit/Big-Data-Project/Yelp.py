   ## Elevate Your Restaurant's Visibility with Yelp's Streamlit Dashboard

    Welcome to Yelp's exclusive Streamlit web dashboard, a revolutionary tool designed to transform how Yelp approaches digital advertising. In the ever-competitive entrepreneurial world, our dashboard offers Yelp-listed businesses a unique advantage – the ability to make strategic, data-backed decisions for targeted advertising and business analysis.
    
    ### Dashboard Overview
    Our Streamlit dashboard, tailored using Yelp's extensive business listings, is segmented into two insightful sections:
    
    1. **Business Insights 🌍**: This section is a treasure trove for the Yelp marketing and advertising team seeking to understand what businesses need a better engagement on their Cost-Per-Click plan. It analyzes various business categories in-depth, focusing on review counts and public perception. By comparing high and low review counts across categories and businesses where State and City businesses are located, you can identify market trends, gauge customer interest, and understand where Yelp can target their team to increase user Cost-Per-Click engagement.
    
    2. **Target Ads 📊**: Leveraging Yelp's rich user reviews and preferences database, the 'Target Ads' section enables Yelp to create highly effective advertising campaigns. By analyzing past review categories, we help Yelp identify potential customers most likely interested in certain categories. This targeted approach ensures that the ads reach the most relevant and responsive audience, increasing the likelihood of engagement and conversion.
