You can [run the notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11WBCrwNzbNWN7QbMEwzy-8MZROOVQFnZ?usp=sharing) and leverage the free GPU to speed up the computation!

## How to deploy the Streamlit app locally with Docker ##
Assuming docker is running on your machine and you have a docker account, do the following:
- Build the image

``` bash
docker build -t <USERNAME>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME> .
```

- Run the image

``` bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 <USERNAME>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>
```

- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501/`
