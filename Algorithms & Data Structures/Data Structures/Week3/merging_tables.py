# python3
# Task. There are n tables stored in some database. The tables are numbered from 1 to n. All tables share
# the same set of columns. Each table contains either several rows with real data or a symbolic link to
# another table. Initially, all tables contain data, and i-th table has r[i] rows. You need to perform ùëö of
# the following operations:
# 1. Consider table number destination[i] Traverse the path of symbolic links to get to the data. That is,
# while destination[i] contains a symbolic link instead of real data do
# destination[i] <- symlink(destination[i])
# 2. Consider the table number source[i] and traverse the path of symbolic links from it in the same manner as for destination[i].
# 3. Now, destination[i] and source[i] are the numbers of two tables with real data. If destination[i] != source[i]
# copy all the rows from table source[i] to table destination[i] then clear the table source[i]
# and instead of real data put a symbolic link to destination[i] into it.
# 4. Print the maximum size among all n tables (recall that size is the number of rows in the table).
# If the table contains only a symbolic link, its size is considered to be 0.
# Input Format. The first line of the input contains two integers n and m ‚Äî the number of tables in the database and the number of merge queries to perform, respectively.
# The second line of the input contains n integers r[i] ‚Äî the number of rows in the i-th table.
# Then follow m lines describing merge queries. Each of them contains two integers destination[i] and
# source[i] ‚Äî the numbers of the tables to merge.
# Output Format. For each query print a line containing a single integer ‚Äî the maximum of the sizes of all
# tables (in terms of the number of rows) after the corresponding operation.
