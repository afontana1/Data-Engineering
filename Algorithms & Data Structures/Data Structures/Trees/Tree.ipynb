    "A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of full binary tree.\n",
    "2. **Complete binary tree**:\n",
    "A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.\n",
    "3. **Perfect Binary Tree**:\n",
    "A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at same level.\n",
    "4. **Balanced Binary Tree**:\n",
    "A binary tree is balanced if height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is number of nodes. For Example, AVL tree maintain O(Log n) height by making sure that the difference between heights of left and right subtrees is 1. Red-Black trees maintain O(Log n) height by making sure that the number of Black nodes on every root to leaf paths are same and there are no adjacent red nodes. Balanced Binary Search trees are performance wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete.\n",
    "5. **A degenerate (or pathological) tree**:\n",
    "A Tree where every internal node has one child. Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list.\n",
