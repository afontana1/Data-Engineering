# Task. The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.
# Input Format. The first line of the input contains the number n of items and the capacity W of a knapsack.
# The next n lines define the values and weights of the items. The i-th line contains integers v[i] and w[i]â€”the
# value and the weight of i-th item, respectively.
# Output Format. Output the maximal value of fractions of items that fit into the knapsack.

# Greedy algorithm: Take the items with maximum v[j] to w[j] ratio until the capacity is full
# If we have capacity W and j-th item has maximum ratio of values to weights. Either w[j] >= W or w[j] < W.
# Case 1: w[j] >= W
# Let i != j, i' != i and i' != j.
# If w[i] > W, then v[j]/w[j] * W > v[i]/w[i]*W implies picking j-th item as optimal.
# Otherwise, v[i] + v[i']/w[i']*(W - w[i]) < v[i]/w[i]*w[i] + v[i]/w[i]*(W - w[i]) = v[i]/w[i]*W < v[j]/w[j]*W. So, it's optimal to pick j-th item.
# Case 2: w[j] < W
# As v[j] > v[i]*w[j]/w[i], we should pick j-th item.
# In both cases, pick j-th item is a safe move.
