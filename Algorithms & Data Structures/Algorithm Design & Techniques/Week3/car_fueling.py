# Problem. You are going to travel to another city that is located d miles away from your home city. Your car can travel
# at most m miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank. Along your way, there are gas stations at
# distances stop[1], stop[2], . . . , stop[n] from your home city. What is the minimum number of refills needed?
# Input Format. The first line contains an integer d. The second line contains an integer m. The third line
# specifies an integer n. Finally, the last line contains integers stop[1], stop[2], . . . , stop[n].
# Output Format. Assuming that the distance between the cities is d miles, a car can travel at most m miles
# on a full tank, and there are gas stations at distances stop[1], stop[2], . . . , stop[n] along the way, output the
# minimum number of refills needed. Assume that the car starts with a full tank. If it is not possible to
# reach the destination, output âˆ’1.
# Note: 0 < stop[1] < stop[2] < ... < stop[n] < d

    # Suppose we have an optimal route R which refills at stop[1] and stop [2]. Consider a subproblem with stop[1], stop[r], stop[2] in which stop[r] is the farthest reachable
    # Suppose stop[1] < stop[r] < stop[2]. Refill at stop[r] instead of stop [2] is also an optimal solution.
    # Otherwise if stop[1] < stop[2] < stop[r]. Refill at stop[r] is optimal because only 1 refill is needed and contradicts that R is an optimal route.
    # Hence, refill at the farthest stop is optimal to the subproblem. Hence, it's a safe move
