# Task. The airline offers a bunch of flights and has a set of crews that can work on those flights. However,
# the flights are starting in different cities and at different times, so only some of the crews are able to
# work on a particular flight. You are given the pairs of flights and associated crews that can work on
# those flights. You need to assign crews to as many flights as possible and output all the assignments.
# Input Format. The first line of the input contains integers n and m ‚Äî the number of flights and the number
# of crews respectively. Each of the next n lines contains ùëö binary integers (0 or 1). If the j-th integer
# in the i-th line is 1, then the crew number j can work on the flight number i, and if it is 0, then it cannot.
# Output Format. Output ùëõ integers ‚Äî for each flight, output the 1-based index of the crew assigned to
# this flight. If no crew is assigned to a flight, output ‚àí1 as the index of the crew corresponding to it.
# All the positive indices in the output must be between 1 and m, and they must be pairwise different,
# but you can output any number of ‚àí1‚Äôs. If there are several assignments with the maximum possible
# number of flights having a crew assigned, output any of them.
