# Task. Compute a topological ordering of a given directed acyclic graph (DAG) with ùëõ vertices and ùëö edges.
# Input Format. A graph is given in the standard format.
# Output Format. Output any topological ordering of its vertices. (Many DAGs have more than just one
# topological ordering. You may output any of them.)
