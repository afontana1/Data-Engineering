# Task. Given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges and two vertices u and v, compute the length
# of a shortest path between u and v (that is, the minimum number of edges in a path from u to v).
# Input Format. A graph is given in the standard format. The next line contains two vertices u and v.
# Output Format. Output the minimum number of edges in a path from u to v, or âˆ’1 if there is no path.
